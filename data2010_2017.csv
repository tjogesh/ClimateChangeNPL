Finding itself released, a mass of moist cold air spills southward, bringing snow and chill down into North America and Europe.And it tends to stay there, because of what happens to the jet stream.Instead of encircling the northern hemisphere in a sturdy and predictable fashion, this high-altitude wind takes a lazy looping path, zigzagging over the United States, the Atlantic and Europe. The southern parts of the loops get a bout of cold weather that becomes stalled in place._Heat that is stored in the (Arctic) ocean can rapidly transfer to the atmosphere, and this affects the dynamicsÓ of northern hemisphere weather patterns, said Coumou in a phone interview._Weêve had a couple of winters (in Europe) where youêve had rather shorter-term cold spells, of a duration of maybe 10, 20, 30 days... Itês been the same in the continental US and Canada where theyêve seen similar quite bizarre cold spells but of a relatively shorter period.Ó- Arctic warming ¥stacks the deckê -Charles Greene, director of the Ocean Resources and Ecosystems Program at Cornell University in New York, said Arctic warming added a joker or two to the climate pack._With the changes in sea ice, we set up a situation where we stack the deck, increasing the probability of these invasions of cold Arctic air,Ó he said._But whatês less predictable is which regions in the mid-latitudes will get hit. Weêre not sure yet how it will interact with other parts of the climate system in any given year, for instance how it will interact with El Nino and La Nina.ÓGreene also postulates that Superstorm Sandy last October wreaked its havoc because of a high-pressure zone over Greenland, possibly strengthened by changes triggered by sea-ice loss in the Arctic.Like a barrier closing off a street, this mass of air forced Sandy to turn sharply west so that it slammed into the US East Coast. Normally, late-season hurricanes follow a northeastern track and peter out at sea.The warming-and-winter scenario is far from unanimous in climatology. Other experts call for more evidence, especially from longer-term data._Looking at whatês happening right now, in early spring, itês too early to say whether it is due in part to a temporary climatic swing,Ó said David Salas-y-Melia of Meteo France, the French meteorological agency.Jeff Knight of Britainês Met Office pointed to a natural climate variation called the North Atlantic Oscillation, whose phases tend to span 30-40 years. Several decades of relatively harsher winters alternate with relatively milder ones - but there can also be years within these phases that buck the trend._In Europe, the effect of climate variability is quite large,Ó said Knight. _There are possible links to explain why sea ice might influence atmospheric circulation, but the jury is very much still out at the moment.Ó _AFP",,,30,Mar,2013,HT,Opinion,MS Swaminathan,,Maharashtra needs to formulate a Drought Code: MS Swaminathan,Parts of Maharashtra are experiencing an unprecedented drought.

Moreover, accumulation of methane generally occurred below the depths of water intake for power generation and irrigation,"" the NIO said in a statement Wednesday.  A study by Ivan Lima and his colleagues from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, published in a peer-reviewed journal, concluded that annual methane emissions from dam-reservoirs in India alone were estimated to be around 33.5 million tonnes.  That figure, if true, would amount to about 19 percent of the country's global warming emissions from all sources and 28 percent of methane emission from all large dams of the world.  ""These figures raised a great deal of alarm in the media and among policy makers,"" the NIO statement said.  The NIO scientists made extensive measurements of methane in eight dams-reservoirs across India from the Western Ghats (Selaulim, Supa, Tillari, Koyna and Markandeya) to the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (Rihand) and the foothills of the Himalayas (Bhakra Nangal).  ""Although most of these reservoirs were found to turn anaerobic during the summer, measured dissolved methane concentrations are substantially lower than assumed in the above-mentioned study,"" the NIO said.  ""These results demonstrate that the hydroelectric power in the country appears to be quite green,"" the NIO said.",,,3,Apr,2013,TOI,Reporter,Nandini Sen Gupta,CHennai,Volkswagen's eco-campaign helps reduce CO2 emission and energy consumption in Pune plant,Volkswagen India's 'Think Blue.

It also added that works such as check dams, percolation tanks and de-silting of water bodies have contributed to an increase in areas irrigated by borewells and open wells, potentially leading to increased and sustained crop yields in most of the villages in the study area. The survey conducted as part of the study also said the programme has increased drinking water supply in the villages because of increase in number of water bodies developed under the employment programme. The study also found land development works under the programme has contributed in improving soil fertility in 72% of agriculture areas resulting in some improvement in production. Soil organic matter or carbon content is a very important indicator of soil fertility and land productivity, the report said. The governmentês use of manpower under the programme for afforestation, reforestation and horticulture had a positive impact in 31 of the 40 villages, where the study was done. Its exact impact was not known as trees have not reached their fruit bearing stage.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had said that agriculture would be worst affected by climate change in South Asia, especially India, and had asked countries to adopt policies for climate change mitigation. The institute suggested that the programme should focus more on protection of natural resources, maintenance of assets created and empower the village bodies - gram sabha - to monitor the works undertaken under the programme.

Fuel accounts for a third of airline costs.  IATA currently predicts an industry profit of $10.6 billion in 2013 and Tyler said Mondayês update would set a _cautiously optimisticÓ tone for the meeting of 700 aviation executives.  An 18-month slump in cargo showed signs of stabilizing in April. In North America, airlines have managed to keep capacity in check, keeping planes full and ticket prices up.  _The economy has been OK but not robust. Usually (airline) prices ebb and flow with oil and now we see they have some ability to maintain their pricing power,Ó said Basili Alukos, an airlines analyst with Morningstar, based in Chicago.  Overshadowing the discussions will be lingering fears of a trade war as governments remain deadlocked over fuel emissions.  The European Union has pledged to re-introduce a controversial emissions trading scheme opposed by a group of other countries unless everyone can agree on a global system.  But little progress has been made in a United Nations effort to craft an agreement to lower emissions from international air travel, raising doubts that a September target date can be met.  Failure to agree has given the airline industry itself a slim window of opportunity to forge a common position and seize the initiative before the UNês aviation body meets in September.  But airlines are seen as split over who should pay the most if the world does manage to come up with a market-based scheme for taxing emissions deemed harmful to the environment.  Airlines in the Gulf and Asia are growing at a much faster pace than those in mature European and North American markets.  One of the industryês most sensitive topics is whether the whole industry should underwrite its goal of carbon-neutral growth or whether those growing the most should also pay the most.  IATA has said it will seek the _fairest possible agreementÓ at its annual summit and is urging airlines to compromise or see their fate controlled by a jumble of uncoordinated policies.

For the seventh time in the last 20 years that he has been residing in Bahuka, Qader will be forced to rebuild his life from scratch as the mighty Jamuna river continues to erode its banks and destroy everything in its wake - all thanks to global warming.  According to inhabitants of Bahuka, 110 km northwest of Bangladesh capital Dhaka, the Jamuna has swallowed 10 embankments - artificial banks built above the level of the original banks to hold back excess water - and with it all buildings built on the banks, since 1968.  ""This has been going on for years. The Jamuna breaches the banks throughout the year and this has accelerated in recent times,"" the 56-year-old Qader told a visiting IANS correspondent.  Mashfiqus Salehin, professor at the Institute of Water and Flood Management in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, said the constant shifting of Bahuka's residents is not uncommon since erosion is a ""very big"" issue in the region.  ""Because of the flood and erosion problems, they have to shift to a higher elevation. For an adult to shift 6 to 10 times in his lifetime is not very unusual,"" Salehin said.  The Jamuna, one of the main rivers of Bangladesh, has numerous criss-crossing channels. It is the main distributory of the Brahmaputra as it flows down from India to Bangladesh. Flowing south, it joins the Padma river and then merges into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna.  Experts attribute the worsening erosion to the widening of the river - a phenomenon which could be a result of global warming.  ""If you stand here for a while you will see more and more chunks of earth falling into the river...this was not so frequent... the bigger the Jamuna gets, the more it erodes. Our school was at Chandnogor village.. now that has disappeared and the current building is at east Bahuka. Soon that will perish too,"" Abdus Salam, headmaster of the primary school, told IANS.  ""It had an average width of 8.2 km in 1975 and in 2000, that was close to 11.7 km. The Jamuna has been widening and the same thing has been happening in the upper Brahmaputra valley,"" Salehin noted.  Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies (BCAS), said it was possible global warming may be playing a role in the havoc the river is causing.  ""There is no doubt that temperature has increased in South Asia. Somewhere it has increased by 0.8 degrees or 0.7 degrees. Due to this, an ecosystem shift has been observed too. The increase in temperature has led to glacial melting ..it may have increased the river's volume..all these factors have contributed to the erosion caused by the river,"" Rahman said.  According to Sabber Ahmed of the BCAS, who works on tectonic evolution of the Jamuna since the river downstream in Bangladesh is comparatively flatter than that in upstream India, the slope lowers the velocity and results in sedimentation.  ""Over time this sedimentation forms bars, which are visible throughout the channel. Because of the bars, water splits and hits both banks of the river. As a result, we see excessive erosion on both banks. If we analyse satellite images, we would find that the width of the river has increased and the depth has decreased....the increase in erosion is due to this,"" Ahmed pointed out.  For the villagers who have adapted to this vicious cycle - by making residences out of tin and asbestos as they can be disassembled and pieced back together at another location - dams are the solution, even as the 11th embankment on the Jamuna is on its way.  ""We have told the government to construct dams, but they are not listening,"" 70-year-old Bahuka resident Hafizul asserted.  However, Indian river expert Kalyan Rudra pointed out that instead of opting for artificial structures that are not viable, land use must be adapted according to the river's behaviour.  ""It's a futile exercise...it's a short term measure but doesn't sustain for the long term. Moreover, planning land use should be in line with the river's nature. But the reverse has been happening. not only in Bangladesh but in India as well,"" Rudra told IANS.  ""This type of protection is a local method guided by electoral politics. The population has gone up so much that people are encroaching upon the flood plains,"" Rudra added.  For headmaster Salam and his family, the clock is ticking away.  ""We can only hope for a miracle,"" he said ruefully.",,,17,Jun,2013,TOI,No byline,,Kochi,Kochi Metro Rail Ltd ropes in CDM Smith to study carbon emissions,"The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has assigned CDM Smith, an international agency, to carry out a detailed survey on the reduction of carbon emissions along the Kochi Metro route from 2018 to 2048.

The question is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late,"" the president said.  Obama laid out a broad new plan to fight climate change on Tuesday, using executive powers to get around deniers who have blocked action in Congress. He called for new restrictions on existing and new power plants to curb carbon emissions, pledged to push new generation clean energy sources and to lead a fresh global effort to stem global warming.  ""This is the fight America can and will lead in the 21st century. But it will require all of us, as citizens, to do our part,"" the president said Saturday, calling for scientists to develop biofuels and farmers to grow them, engineers to design clean technology and businesses to get them to market.  ""We will be judged -- as a people, as a society, and as a country -- on where we go from here,"" Obama said.  Some opponents of his approach have warned that the plan could result in older coal-fired plants being taken offline and may thereby raise electricity prices for consumers, which could disproportionately hurt the poor.  Officials counter that the plan will reduce the amount of electricity used -- thereby reducing fuel bills.  However, the specifics of much of his plan were unclear, and many of Obama's new rules could face court challenges that would delay their implementation.  Meanwhile, speaking for Republicans on another contentious issue, Senator Pat Roberts from Kansas raised concerns over the health care reform package Obama championed in his first term.  The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012, aims to provide health care coverage to an additional 30 million Americans.

A massive new study finds that aggressive acts like committing violent crimes and waging war become more likely with each added degree.  Researchers analysed 60 studies on historic empire collapses, recent wars, violent crime rates in the United States, lab simulations that tested police decisions on when to shoot and even cases where pitchers threw deliberately at batters in baseball. They found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather - very hot or dry - means more violence.  The authors say the results show strong evidence that climate can promote conflict.  _When the weather gets bad we tend to be more willing to hurt other people,Ó said economist Solomon Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley.  He is the lead author of the study, published online yesterday (Aug 1) by the journal Science. Experts in the causes of war gave it a mixed reception.  The team of economists even came up with a formula that predicts how much the risk of different types of violence should increase with extreme weather. In war-torn parts of equatorial Africa, it says, every added degree Fahrenheit or so increases the chance of conflict between groups- rebellion, war, and civil unrest - by 11 per cent to 14 per cent. For the United States, the formula says that for every increase of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, the likelihood of violent crime goes up 2 per cent to 4 per cent.  Temperatures in much of North America and Eurasia are likely to go up by that 5.4 degrees by about 2065 because of increases in carbon dioxide pollution, according to a separate paper published in Science yesterday.  The same paper sees global averages increasing by about 3.6 degrees in the next half-century. So that implies essentially about 40 per cent to 50 per cent more chance for African wars than it would be without global warming, said Edward Miguel, another Berkeley economist and study co-author.  When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updates its report next year on the impacts of global warming, it will address the issue of impacts on war for the first time, said Carnegie Institution scientist Chris Field, who heads that worldwide study group. The new study is likely to play a big role, he said.  Hsiang said that whenever the analysed studies looked at temperature and conflict, the link was clear, no matter where or when. His analysis examines about a dozen studies on collapses of empires or dynasties, about 15 studies on crime and aggression and more than 30 studies on wars, civil strife or intergroup conflicts.  In one study, police officers in a psychology experiment were more likely to choose to shoot someone in a lab simulation when the room temperature was hotter, Mr Hsiang said. In another study, baseball pitchers were more likely to retaliate against their opponents when a teammate was hit by a pitch on hotter days. Mr Hsiang pointed to the collapse of the Mayan civilization that coincided with periods of historic drought about 1,200 years ago.  People often donêt consider human conflict when they think about climate change, which is _an important oversight,Ó said Ohio State University psychology professor Brad Bushman, who wasnêt part of the study but whose work on crime and heat was analysed by Mr Hsiang.  Thereês a good reason why people get more aggressive in warmer weather, Bushman said. Although people say they feel sluggish when they are hot, their heart rate and other physical responses are aroused and elevated. They think they are not agitated, when in fact they are, and _thatês a recipe for disaster,Ó Prof Bushman said.  Experts who research war and peace were split in their reaction to the work.  _The world will be a very violent place by mid-century if climate change continues as projected,Ó said Thomas Homer-Dixon, a professor of diplomacy at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Ontario.  But Joshua Goldstein, a professor of international relations at American University and author of _Winning the War on War,Ó found faults with the way the study measured conflicts. He said the idea of hotter tempers with hotter temperatures is only one factor in conflict, and that it runs counter to a long and large trend to less violence.  _To read this you get the impression, if climate change unfolds as we all fear it will, that the world will be beset by violent conflict and thatês probably not true,Ó Prof Goldstein said.  _Because of positive changes in technology, economics, politics and healthÓ conflict is likely to continue to drop, although maybe not as much as it would without climate change, he said.  Mr Miguel acknowledges that many other factors play a role in conflict and said itês too soon to see whether conflict from warming will outweigh peace from prosperity: _Itês a race against time.Ó AP",NO LINK,,16,Aug,2013,TOI,ANI,,Washington,Antarctic ice core reveals how last ice age ended,"Analysis of an Antarctic ice core has revealed that warming in the frozen continent began about 22,000 years ago, a few thousand years earlier than suggested by earlier records.",http://zeenews.india.com/news/science/antarctic-ice-core-reveals-how-last-ice-age-ended_869408.html,http://zeenews.india.com/news/science/antarctic-ice-core-reveals-how-last-ice-age-ended_869408.html,SS,DKS,S,,,POL,A1,B4,C7,,University of Washington,,D1,,,T6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Washington: Analysis of an Antarctic ice core has revealed that warming in the frozen continent began about 22,000 years ago, a few thousand years earlier than suggested by earlier records.  The new research shows that Antarctic warming began at least two, and perhaps four, millennia earlier than had been previously believed.  Most previous evidence for Antarctic climate change had come from ice cores drilled in East Antarctica, the highest and coldest part of the continent. However, a U.S.-led research team studying the West Antarctic core found that warming there was well underway 20,000 years ago.  National Science Foundation- (NSF) funded West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide site is in an area where there is little horizontal flow of the ice, so the data are known to be from a location that remained consistent over long periods.  The WAIS Divide ice core is more than two miles deep and covers a period stretching back 68,000 years, though so far data have been analyzed only from layers going back 30,000 years. Near the surface, one meter of snow is equal to a year of accumulation, but at greater depths the annual layers are compressed to centimeters of ice.  T.J. Fudge , a University of Washington doctoral student in Earth and Space Sciences and lead corresponding author, said that sometimes we think of Antarctica as this passive continent waiting for other things to act on it. But here it is showing changes before it `knows` what the North is doing.  Fudge identified the annual layers by running two electrodes along the ice core to measure higher electrical conductivity associated with each summer season.  Evidence of greater warming turned up in layers associated with 18,000 to 22,000 years ago, the beginning of the last deglaciation.  Fudge said that this deglaciation is the last big climate change that we`re able to go back and investigate,"" he said. ""It teaches us about how our climate system works.  He said that it is not surprising that West Antarctica is showing something different from East Antarctica on long time scales, but we didn`t have direct evidence for that before.  Fudge noted that the warming in West Antarctica 20,000 years ago is not explained by a change in the sun`s intensity. Instead, how the sun`s energy was distributed over the region was a much bigger factor.  He said that it not only warmed the ice sheet but also warmed the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica, particularly during summer months when more sea ice melting could take place.  Fudge explained that changes in Earth`s orbit today are not an important factor in the rapid warming that has been observed recently.  He added that Earth`s orbit changes on the scale of thousands of years, but carbon dioxide today is changing on the scale of decades so climate change is happening much faster today.  The research has been published online in the journal Nature.  ANI",,,17,Aug,2013,NIE,No byline,,Hyderabad,Eco conservation can be a poll plank: R K Pachauri,"Laying out ways to tackle climate change problems, R K Pachauri said that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone, but adoption of both will help in handling challenges posed by climate change, and added that if people enforce environment conservation as an election agenda, then politicians will take up the issue of climate problem.",http://newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/Eco-conservation-can-be-a-poll-plank-R-K-Pachauri/2013/08/17/article1738018.ece,http://newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/Eco-conservation-can-be-a-poll-plank-R-K-Pachauri/2013/08/17/article1738018.ece,IPT,IS,IP,IS,,DC,IA2,IB10,IC6,,R K Pachauri,P,ID5,,,IT6,,,IJP,POOR,,,,M&A,,NAPCC,COB,,,,,,,17,Aug,2013,TOI,PTI,,Washington,"Warming climate pushing plants up the mountain, scientists say","Increasingly warmer and drier climate is pushing plant species to higher elevations on a southern Arizona mountain, scientists say.",http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-17/global-warming/41420303_1_plant-species-climate-higher-elevations,http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-17/global-warming/41420303_1_plant-species-climate-higher-elevations,GS,,S,,,US,IA1,B4,C7,,University of Arizona,,D1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NO LINK,,30,Aug,2013,HT,Guardian,Fiona Harvey,,Cooling waters of the Pacific and puzzle of global warming,"Cooling waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean appear to be a major factor in dampening global warming in recent years, scientists said on Wednesday.

But few are aware that both of these systems are just part of the much bigger Pacific decadal oscillation, which brings warmer and cooler weather over decades.  The system is now in a cooling phase, scientists have noted, which could last for years. The last such phase was from the 1940s to the 1970s.   Global temperature rise  Global temperature rise Photograph: Guardian The new study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and supported by the US government's National Oceans and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), published in the journal Nature, has linked the ""pause"" in global warming with the Pacific oscillation.  Advertisement  Dan Barrie, programme manager at NOAA, called the research ""compelling"" and said: ""[It] provides a powerful illustration of how the remote eastern tropical Pacific guides the behaviour of the global ocean-atmosphere system, in this case exhibiting a discernible influence on the recent hiatus in global warming.""  In winter, the effect of the cooler phase of the oscillation on the northern hemisphere is to depress temperatures slightly; but in summer, the cooler waters in the equatorial Pacific have less impact on the northern hemisphere's weather. The scientists, using computer models, compared their results with observations and concluded that global average annual temperatures have been lower than they would otherwise have been because of the oscillation. But the observed higher summer temperatures of recent years show more of the true effects of global warming, according to the research. Global average temperatures are taken over the whole year, obscuring the effect of this seasonal variation.   Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you  Read more Shang-Ping Xie, professor of environmental science at Scripps, said: ""In summer, the equatorial Pacific's grip on the northern hemisphere loosens, and the increased greenhouse gases continue to warm temperatures, causing record heat waves and unprecedented Arctic sea ice retreat.""  Dr Alex Sen Gupta, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not part of the study team, said: ""The authors have set up some elegant experiments using a climate model to test whether a natural oscillation that has gone through a large swing in the tropical Pacific Ocean over the last decade can explain the recent halt in surface global warming € the new simulation accurately reproduces the timing and pattern of changes that have occurred over the last four decades with remarkable skill. This clearly shows that the recent slowdown is a consequence of a natural oscillation.""  The role of oceans in regulating the planet's temperatures has taken on a greater significance in climate change research, as not enough is yet known about how ocean currents and the circulation of warmer surface water to the deep oceans below affect the weather and climate.  Advertisement  Research indicates that oceans have absorbed much of the heat and about a third of the additional carbon dioxide pumped into the air from pre-industrial times. This has an effect _ the thermal expansion of the oceans is likely to be the biggest factor behind sea level rise, and the absorption of carbon dioxide is making the oceans more acidic.  Scientists also think that the circulation of heat from the top layers of the ocean, which have been most affected to date, to the deeper oceans below may be another factor behind the ""hiatus"" in global warming. What the full effects of this exchange of energy may be, particularly on ocean currents, is not yet known.  Researchers have called for more observations of the ocean, including many more buoys and underwater readings.  The slowdown in the upward march of global average temperatures has been greeted by climate sceptics as evidence that the climate is less affected by greenhouse gases than thought. But climate scientists are much more cautious, pointing out that the trend is still upwards, and that the current temperature rises are well within the expected range. Past temperature records and computer predictions both show that periods of slower rises are to be expected as part of the natural variability of the planet's climate.  These issues are likely to be a major focus of the forthcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body of scientists who produce the most authoritative and comprehensive summaries of climate research. Their eagerly awaited fifth report, seven years since the last, will be published next month. It is likely to affirm that scientists are more certain than ever _ at least 95%, up from 90% previously _ that climate change is happening and is mostly caused by human actions, but it may suggest that the climate is slightly less sensitive to carbon than some outlying research has posited. That may mean that some of the highest estimates of future temperature rises, of more than 6C within several decades, are less likely, but it does not let the world off the hook _ warming of more than 2C is still highly likely on current high emissions trends, and that would cause severe consequences around the world.  A discussion of the recent ""hiatus"" in temperature rises, and its causes, will form an important part of the IPCC report. However, as the main source papers for the IPCC had to be gathered some time ago, the Scripps-led study of the Pacific decadal oscillation will not have made it into the final report, the first part of which will be presented at a meeting in Stockholm next month.  The Scripps research team said the current cooling phase in the Pacific began just after a strong El Ni_o year in 1998, but that it was not possible to predict when it might end.  They arrived at the conclusion by using innovative computer modeling methods to simulate regional patterns of climate anomalies. This enabled them to see global warming in greater spatial detail, revealing where it has been most intense and where there has been no warming or even cooling.  They developed new computer models that could show regional and seasonal variations in temperature, as well as global patterns. ""Climate models consider anthropogenic forcings like greenhouse gases and tiny atmospheric particles known as aerosols, but they cannot study a specific climate event like the current hiatus,"" said Yu Kosaka, co-author of the Nature paper. ""We devised a new method for climate models to take equatorial Pacific ocean temperatures as an additional input.""  When these were taken into account, the models predicted the temperature changes observed, including the current ""hiatus"" in the upward climb of temperatures.  Advertisement  The scientists warned, however, that when the current cooling phase turns, the upward march of temperatures is likely to resume, perhaps at faster rates than before as greenhouse gas emission rates are higher.  Xie said: ""We don't know precisely when we're going to come out of [the hiatus] but we know that over the timescale of several decades, the climate will continue to warm as we pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.""  Some of the effects of the cooling in the Pacific are not straightforward _ drier temperatures in the US midwest are one of the associated results.  During the last cool phase, warmer, drier weather dominated in the midwestern US, as it has in the past 15 years with a serious drought prevailing through much of the region for much of the time.",,,30,Aug,2013,TOI,Reporter,Chinmayi Shalya,Mumbai,"Flights go green, to use less fuel, cut emissions",Mumbai air space is all set to handle green flights or user preferred routes (UPR) flights.

But a little known market in ethanol credits has also become a hot new game on Wall Street.  The federal government created the market in special credits tied to ethanol eight years ago when it required refiners to mix ethanol into gasoline or buy credits from companies that do so. The idea was to push refiners to use the cleaner, renewable fuel, or force them to buy the credits.  A few worried that Wall Street would set out to exploit this young market, fears the government dismissed. But many people believe that is what happened this year when the price of the ethanol credits skyrocketed 20-fold in just six months, according to an analysis of regulatory documents and interviews with more than 40 people involved in the market, including industry executives, brokers, traders and analysts.  Traders for big banks and other financial institutions, these people say, amassed millions of the credits just as refiners were looking to buy more of them to meet an expanding federal requirement. Industry executives familiar with JPMorgan Chaseês activities, for example, told The Times that the bank offered to sell them hundreds of millions of the credits earlier this summer. When asked how the bank had amassed such a stake, the executives said they were told by the bank that it had stockpiled the credits.  A spokesman for JPMorgan, when asked about the exchange with the executives, disputed the account, saying the bank does not trade ethanol credits for a profit in the way it trades other securities, but is registered to deal in credits through its energy business. From time to time, the spokesman, Brian J. Marchiony, said in a statement that the bank also purchased credits _on behalf of clients who need to fulfill their E.P.A.-mandated obligations,Ó though it had not done so in the past year.  Continue reading the main story RELATED COVERAGE  graphic The Price of an Ethanol Credit SEPT. 14, 2013 RECENT COMMENTS  Steve Fankuchen September 16, 2013 Ethanol in gasoline.CFL light bulbs.Unintended consequences be damned.One does not have to be a Tea Partier to understand the self-serving... myatoms September 16, 2013 How many of the traders who made the massive profits were at the 38,000 per plate fundraisers?

OêMalley, chairman of PBF Energy in Parsippany, N.J., identified JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions as being active sellers of the credits this year. He said the institutions had helped transform an environmental program into a profit machine, contributing to the market frenzy this year. _These things were designed to monitor the inclusion of ethanol in the gasoline pool,Ó Mr. OêMalley said. _They werenêt designed to become a speculative item. For the life of me I canêt see the justification for it.Ó  While banks are by no means the largest player in ethanol credits, Wall Streetês activity in this market reflects a larger effort by financial institutions to exert their influence over loosely regulated markets for basic commodities, from aluminum to oil. The opacity of the ethanol credit market makes it difficult to determine the extent to which large financial actors have profited.  The banks say they have far less influence in the market than others are suggesting, and are doing nothing wrong. But the activities, while legal, could have consequences for consumers. In the end, energy analysts say, the outcome will be felt at the gas pump ‹ as the higher cost of the ethanol credits gets tacked onto the price of a gallon of gasoline. (The credits, which cost 7 cents each in January, peaked at $1.43 in July, and now are trading for 60 cents.)  The Valero Energy Corporation, a refiner that owns thousands of gas stations, says the squeeze in ethanol credits might cost it $800 million. PBF Energy, also a refiner, puts its bill at about $200 million. A review by The Times of a federal registry of nearly 1,500 businesses and individuals in the renewable fuel market found big Wall Street banks as well as a handful of people with troubled legal histories among the participants. Several high-profile cases of fraud have emerged.  Scott Mixon, the acting chief economist of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said in an interview Friday that the issue of banksê involvement in this market was something the agency was tracking and might look into more deeply because of the ethanol component. The commission regulates the commodities futures market, including trading in ethanol and gasoline.  Though the ethanol credits are traded by many major investment houses, they were created not on Wall Street but in Washington, on Capitol Hill and at the Environmental Protection Agency. At its inception, the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard was promoted as a means to reduce the nationês reliance on foreign oil, fight global warming and provide a boost to farmers. The rules call for a set amount of ethanol, most of which is made from corn, and other renewable fuels to be blended with fossil fuels each year, with quotas assigned to individual refiners and importers.  Every time they mix ethanol into gas, or import fuel already blended with ethanol, energy companies get a credit from the government, and that credit can be sold to other companies that donêt blend ethanol to help them meet federal requirements. If refiners fall short of their obligation, they can face fines of $32,500 a day. To monitor compliance, each gallon of ethanol is assigned a 38-digit Renewable Identification Number, or RIN. Six billion of them were generated in the first six months of this year.  Photo  The credits ""weren't designed to become a speculative item. For the life of me I can't see the justification for it."" THOMAS D. O'MALLEY, the chairman of PBF Energy in Parsippany, N.J. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times The E.P.A. makes sure participants comply with the fuel standard. But rules that apply to almost every other market ‹ on transparency, disclosure and position limits, for example ‹ are not imposed on the trade of RINs, making Wall Streetês role harder to gauge.  If Wall Street traders take a 5 percent stake in a public companyês stock, for instance, they are required by law to flag that they have acquired a sizable stake in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There is no such obligation for traders buying RINs.  Like JPMorgan, other big banks downplay their involvement, contending that they are in the market primarily because their firms, through subsidiaries and other arrangements, have ownership interests in gasoline and other energy production and therefore are required to participate in the federal renewable fuels program.  Until 1999, regulations barred banks from owning nonfinancial companies like commodities operations. This was meant to keep banks from self-dealing or pursuing monopolistic practices in their financial operations that could benefit their nonfinancial affiliates. Separating these operations, regulators believed, would also protect a bankês core lending and deposit-taking businesses from risky trading by nonfinancial units. Those restrictions fell by the wayside with the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which struck down Depression-era banking laws. Now, however, the Federal Reserve is reviewing commodities ownership by banks.  In the case of JPMorgan, the industry executives familiar with its activities in the RINs market said they were told by a top banker in its commodities operation about the stockpiling. The executives said the banker maintained that one of JPMorganês traders had urged the bank to buy up every available credit. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harming business relationships.  Through a spokesman, the banker denied that the conversation took place. Mr. Marchiony, the JPMorgan spokesman, characterized the report as a misunderstanding. He denied the bank had stockpiled the credits. He added that the bank mainly dealt in RINs as a byproduct of its joint venture with a refiner in Philadelphia. _The fact of the matter is, we simply donêt trade RINs, nor do we carry an inventory other than a marginal amount for compliance purposes,Ó the statement said.  Morgan Stanley also generates RINs through TransMontaigne, a subsidiary with 21 blending facilities, and it trades the credits via the Morgan Stanley Capital Group. According to regulatory filings, TransMontaigneês biggest customer for its energy products is the commodities unit of the Morgan Stanley Capital Group, a trading operation that runs out of the former Texaco headquarters in Purchase, N.Y.  Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said that the firm had not benefited from the increase in RIN prices in 2013. _The firmês obligation to purchase RINs as part of our importing and blending of gasoline exceeded the RINs we have received from our wholesale business,Ó he said.  Mr. Lake declined to discuss Morgan Stanleyês holdings of RINs or to say whether the bankês traders used market information received from TransMontaigne.  Trading on information gleaned from a subsidiary like TransMontaigne would be illegal in the stock market, but there are no rules against it in commodities. (Morgan Stanley also holds a stake Heidmar Holdings, of Norwalk, Conn., which owns a fleet of oil tankers.)  Saule T. Omarova, an associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Morgan Stanleyês overlapping activities illustrate how large financial institutions have become deeply entwined in every aspect of the commodities markets.  _In the trading chain between the oil well and the gas station,Ó Ms. Omarova said, _Morgan Stanley is clearly accumulating as many stakes along the way as possible because that is what gives them the most flexibility of control.Ó  Seizing an Opportunity  The market in ethanol credits is exactly the kind Wall Street loves: opaque, lightly regulated and potentially very lucrative.  Photo  ""The last thing we wanted in implementing this program is to get price increases for the customer."" MARGO OGE, former director of the Environmental Protection Agency's office of transportation and air quality. Credit Daniel Rosenbaum for The New York Times Officials at the E.P.A., which oversees the market, say they have seen no evidence of improper trading, like hoarding, in the market. But they do not police the RIN market as a financial regulator would.  _If there were any evidence now or in the future that that was happening, we have the ability to amend the regulation to constrain that,Ó said Christopher Grundler, director of E.P.A.ês office of transportation and air quality, which oversees the renewable fuels program.  It is difficult for outside groups, or even other regulators and law enforcement agencies, to keep tabs on the market, because the E.P.A. declines to disclose who actively trades the credits, or how much they trade, citing the confidentiality of refiners and other participants.  Trading is a private affair, usually conducted by phone, and just about anyone can participate. In creating the market, the E.P.A. says it did not limit the market for RINs to refiners and other energy companies because it wanted to encourage a free market.  Price movements on other commodities futures are limited by the exchanges on which they trade as a check on speculation. But the biofuel credits are not traded on an exchange: their prices are unbridled. And, unlike in the broader financial industry, no formal qualification or license is required before a broker can start trading.  _There is a RINs trading desk at any major brokerage now,Ó said Paul Niznik, bio-fuels manager for Hart Energy, based in Houston. _There are people who are not refiners that are buying and selling RINs like a commodity. They treat it like something to be traded, to be day-traded.Ó  The RINs story began in 2005, when the Bush administration joined Democrats in Congress to pass an energy bill mandating renewable fuel standards. That law was broadened in 2007 to establish requirements for the amount of biofuel to be blended into gasoline annually through 2022. This year, refiners and importers are required to blend 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol, up from 13.2 billion last year. For 2014, the figure is 14.4 billion.  But the estimates Congress used about how much gas Americans would keep buying were wrong. When the biofuel credits were created, gasoline consumption was projected to grow 6 percent by 2013. But thanks in large part to the recession and more fuel-efficient cars, consumption has actually fallen.  Newsletter Sign UpContinue reading the main story DealBook DealBook delivers the news driving the markets and the conversation.

Raising the ethanol level in gasoline, therefore, would require gas stations across America to install new systems. Therefore, refiners have turned to RINs to meet their government obligations rather than blend more ethanol into gasoline.  Some say financial players saw it coming, and jumped into the market.  _When you see something change as rapidly as this, somebodyês hoarding them, somebodyês buying them, somebodyês making big bucks,Ó said Senator Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, a big oil state. After his staff examined the run-up in prices this summer, he said he was concerned that _big moneyed interestsÓ were gaming the credits.  For now, companies like Valero say that they are eating the cost of high RIN prices, which are still eight times more expensive than they were in January. But industry analysts, executives and even researchers at the investment banks predict the cost of the RINsê surge will be passed along to consumers by increasing the price of gasoline, if not later this year then next year.  Mr. OêMalley, the chairman of PBF Energy, likens the outcome to a hidden tax on the public. Unlike other taxes, which go to the government, this one goes to the speculators.  Photo  At a Zarco 66 gas station in Lawrence, Kan., various fuels. Credit Cathryn Farley/Reuters Double-Dipping on Credits  Every day, RINs are born in places like Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Chesapeake, Va., and Bainbridge, Ga. Across a network of 45 fuel terminals in the Southeast, and along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, Morgan Stanleyês TransMontaigne stores, blends and distributes gasoline and other fuels.  Even though it is based in Denver, TransMontaigne sits at the center of a powerful Wall Street energy operation. It delivers 200,000 barrels of refined petroleum products each day, just under 2.5 percent of the total market, and plays a role in the RINs market in addition to any trading its parent, Morgan Stanley, might do. Morgan Stanley bought TransMontaigne in 2006.  For banks, trading RINs for clients can be lucrative. A big reason is that the credits are far more difficult to buy and sell because they are not traded on exchanges like stocks. As a result, the difference between the price at which one party is willing to sell and another is willing to buy is unusually wide. Those fat spreads mean big money for anyone serving as a middleman.  At a hearing in late July at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mr. Mixon, the commissionês acting chief economist, estimated that RIN spreads were 4 percent of a transactionês value. That is far more than the average stock commission.  In addition to Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, other big banks, like Citigroup and Barclays, are also registered with the E.P.A. to trade the credits.  Edward Westlake, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said many big financial firms have gone beyond RINs trading and pushed into blending fuel to create them as well. _Building a tank and blending doesnêt cost a lot of money,Ó Mr. Westlake said, _and there are folks on Wall Street who own tanks who are benefiting from the RINs.Ó  Bank research departments are also trying to pique investor interest in this market. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently published bullish reports on the market. In July, Morgan Stanley published a report predicting that RIN prices would keep rising ‹ and eventually cause gas prices to spike later this year.  Officials at the E.P.A. do not see excessive influence by financial speculators. They suggest the price spikes in RINs this year reflect the expectation of a shortage of the credits because rising renewable fuel mandates are occurring as consumer demand for gasoline is falling. _The market is expecting this future scarcity as the statutory mandates continue to increase,Ó Mr. Grundler said.  Others say that prices are up mostly because the oil industry has refused to invest in renewable energy. For example, Jeremy Martin, a clean energy expert for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said many of the complaints about the credits come from industry players who want to see the renewable fuels program killed.  _It was meant to change behavior, and it was understood that if it was to be binding, RIN prices would not be close to zero,Ó Mr. Martin said.  In fact even before RINs took off, they had become a contentious issue within the energy industry. Ethanol producers like the renewable fuel standards because they essentially guarantee a market for their product. But refiners ‹ particularly those without operations to blend the fuel ‹ regard the standards as an onerous and unnecessary business cost.  The Impact at the Pump  Margo T. Oge, who oversaw the creation of the ethanol credit program at the E.P.A., says that the rising price of RINs ‹ no matter the cause ‹ is good news and an indication that the programês goals are being met.  As the credits get more expensive, she says, oil and gas companies have a financial incentive to add more ethanol to fuel rather than buy credits. That, in turn, reduces oil imports and emissions ‹ which was the point of creating the system in the first place.  Photo  A Valero station in California. Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Ms. Oge, who retired from the E.P.A. last year and is now a visiting scholar at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research group in Washington, said RINs were never supposed to affect the price of gasoline at the pump. If that is the result of the price run-up this year, as many energy analysts predict, it would be an unwelcome outcome, she said.  _The last thing we wanted in implementing this program is to get price increases for the consumer,Ó she said.  Even beyond the likely rise in gasoline prices, critics of the RINs market say it is deeply flawed, and they do not share Ms. Ogeês optimistic takeaway of this yearês market frenzy.  First, by allowing anyone to trade, including those with no real interest in energy, the E.P.A. encouraged speculation, the critics say. Second, the market operates largely in the dark, leaving it vulnerable to manipulation. Third, and perhaps most significant, the federal requirement for ethanol in gasoline means oil companies are captive buyers ‹ meaning they are required to buy the credits when they do not or cannot blend their own fuel ‹ a fact that savvy traders use to their advantage.  _The problem the E.P.A. had is they opened up the market on the trading side, but restricted it on the obligated side to refiners and importers,Ó said Lawrence J. Goldstein, the former president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit bipartisan group.  Analysts and others say the market is vulnerable to questionable practices like short squeezes, where prices are pushed up by holders of the credits to benefit their positions.  _Anybody whoês participating in these markets has the opportunity to throw their weight around,Ó said David J. Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a transportation energy consulting firm. _Whether itês a hedge fund or a refiner or ethanol producer, they would tend to drive the market in directions that are beneficial for whatever their goals.Ó  An examination by The Times of participants registered with the E.P.A. found several people with troubled pasts, including one who was accused of helping run a Ponzi scheme, and another who pleaded guilty to illegal storage of hazardous waste.  The RINs market has come off the boil recently, but at 60 cents apiece the credits still cost far more than they did at the beginning of the year. While the E.P.A. says the market is sound, W. David Montgomery, an economist at Nera Economic Consulting, a unit of Marsh & McLennan, said the agency should install an overseer.  The E.P.A. disagrees, but said it was considering providing more data on who trades and holds RINs and had instituted a voluntary certification system for participants.  _We are exploring things like increasing the regularity of updating the transactional data system and providing more information about production volumes,Ó Mr. Grundler, the E.P.A. official, said. _All are aimed at increasing confidence in this market and increasing compliance, which is our major concern.Ó  But Tom Kloza, an analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, a leading source of petroleum pricing, said the potential for abuse will not disappear on its own.  _You could conceivably have a company in the middle holding millions of RINs,Ó Mr. Kloza said. _Any entity could have a 1, 2 or 5 percent market share in RINs and is waiting to sell them at some explosive gain.

The city, along with Chicago and Philadelphia, recently passed laws to measure how much energy buildings are using as a first step toward boosting their efficiency.  Other places including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Salt Lake City participate in a voluntary federal programme to cut emissions from commercial and industrial buildings.  The cities will work with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Institute for Market Transformation, a non-profit that promotes green building.  The groups said the reductions would be equal to taking more than a million cars off the road and could save residents $1bn annually.  The project is funded by ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's foundation and other philanthropic groups.",no

Scientists have said that changes in average climatic conditions combined with the increasing frequency of unpredictable, extreme weather events may disrupt scientific predictions of the future penguin populations.  Antarctic penguins are dependent year-round on sea ice as a foraging habitat, and survival depends on their ability to respond over both short- and long-term changes in sea ice. For 13 years, researchers collected data on the foraging ability of chick-rearing Adelie penguins on Ross Island, Antarctica.  In the middle of their study, the breaking off of giant icebergs allowed them to determine how such extreme environmental events affect the sea-ice dependent penguins.  The authors suggest that penguins are able to respond to changes in sea ice concentrations under ""normal"" environmental conditions, but not as much in the face of extreme events, like the presence of giant icebergs. Under ""normal"" conditions, Adelie penguins were most successful at finding food at relatively low sea ice concentrations and should be able to cope with future reduction in summer sea ice concentration.  By dramatically changing their immediate environment, giant icebergs reduced the penguins` access to prey and made them more inefficient overall.  These results suggest that an increase in infrequent, extreme environmental events can disrupt the penguins` ability to respond to changes in the environment and can muddle scientific predictions normally based on past observations.",,extra,30,Jan,2014,FE,PTI,,New Delhi,Six PSUs sign up for worldês largest

He also went after those who dispute who is responsible for such emissions, arguing that everyone and every country must take responsibility and act immediately.  _We simply donêt have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,Ó he said, referring to what he called _big companiesÓ that _donêt want to change and spend a lot of moneyÓ to act to reduce the risks. He later singled out big oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders.  _We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,Ó Mr Kerry told the audience gathered at a US Embassy-run American Centre in a Jakarta shopping mall. _Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.Ó   _The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,Ó Mr Kerry said. _We donêt have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,Ó  Mr Kerry, saying that 97 per cent of scientists who have weighed in on the issue agree that the phenomenon is real, argued that the cost of inaction to environments and economies will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earthês rising temperatures.  He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people.  _This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change,Ó Mr Kerry said. _Itês not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk.Ó  He added: _In a sense, climate change can now be considered the worldês largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the worldês most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.Ó  The solution, Mr Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join.  The speech came a day after Mr Kerry won an agreement with China to cooperate more closely with the US on combatting climate change. American officials hope that will help encourage other nations, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit.  Just after Mr Kerry departed Beijing on yesterday, the US and China issued a joint statement saying they had agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures.  China and the US are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists warn such changes are already leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions.  Beijing and Washington launched the US-China Climate Change Working Group last year. They promised progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.  Mr Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea and then China. After leaving Indonesia tomorrow, he will travel on to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.  Before giving his climate change speech today, Mr Kerry toured Jakartaês massive Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesiaês Muslim majority population.  Mr Kerry spent about 20 minutes touring the mosque, chatting briefly with women studying Islamic law and admiring the blue ceiling of its dome.  Having removed his shoes in keeping with Islamic custom, Mr Kerry at one point was shown a gigantic, skin-covered drum which rests sideways on the mosqueês floor and stood several feet taller than his head.  After witnessing a demonstration by the Grand Imam, identified by the State Department as KH Ali Mustafa Yaqub, Mr Kerry then used a club to beat the drum, which is used to call Muslims to prayer.  _It has been a special honour to visit this remarkable place of worship,Ó Mr Kerry said in a handwritten note to memorialise his visit. _We are all bound to one God and the Abrahamic faiths tie us together in love for our fellow man and honour for the same God.Ó AGENCIES",,,16,Feb,2014,MNT,Reporter,Amrit Raj,new Delhi,Norms for fuel efficiency to put auto makers under pressure,"In a setback to the automobile industry, already under pressure because of declining sales, the government has notified mandatory fuel efficiency norms that would push up their production costs.....

AR5,COP,,"Tokyo: Global warming will reduce the world's crop production by up to two percent every decade and wreak $1.45 trillion of economic damage by the end of this century, according to a draft UN report, Japanese media said on Friday.  Getty Images Getty Images The document is the second volume in a long-awaited trilogy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a Nobel-winning group of scientists, which is set to be issued next month after a five-day meeting in Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.  The trilogy is the IPCC's first great overview of the causes and effects of global warming, and options for dealing with it, since 2007.  According to the draft, if global temperatures rise by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit), the world's aggregated gross domestic production will fall by 0.2 to 2 percent, the mass circulation said.  Ads by ZINC  That would translate into 15 trillion yen to 148 trillion yen ($147 billion to $1.45 trillion) in economic losses, calculated against the world's total GDP in 2012, it said.  The planet's crop production will decline by up to two percent every decade as rainfall patterns shift and droughts batter farmland, even as demand for food rises a projected 14 percent, it said.  Other effects from global warming include the loss of land to rising sea levels, forcing hundreds of millions of people to migrate from coastal areas, with the most vulnerable regions including East, South and Southeast Asia, it said.  The draft report, which will be reviewed in the March 25-29 meeting in Yokohama, calls for mitigation measures to reduce the vulnerability of environments to climate change such as flood protection projects and research on the prevention of infectious diseases, it said.  In the first volume of the trilogy, the IPCC said it was more certain than ever that humans were the cause of global warming and predicted temperatures would rise another 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (0.5-8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.  Heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising seas are among the threats that will intensify through warming, it said in in the report released in September in Stockholm.  UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said the report was ""an alarm-clock moment for the world"".  ""To steer humanity out of the high danger zone, governments must step up immediate climate action and craft an agreement in 2015"" against greenhouse gases, she said at the time.  The IPCC has delivered four previous assessments in its 25-year history.  Each edition has sounded an ever-louder siren to warn that temperatures are rising and the risk to the climate system is accentuating.  The projections for this century are based on computer models of trends in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, especially from coal, oil and gas, which provide the backbone of energy supply today.  A Japanese environment ministry official declined to comment on the report, citing IPCC's request to keep it behind closed doors until the final version is approved in Yokohama.  AFP",,,28,Feb,2014,BS,AFP,,Sydney,Climate body says Australia emissions target 'not

This has injected optimism into negotiations that are supposed to climax in Paris next year with the adoption of a long-awaited climate pact.  But India, Russia, Japan and Australia have yet to commit to new limits; and scientists say much sharper emissions cuts are needed in coming decades to keep global warming within 2 degrees C (3.6 F) of pre-industrial times, the overall goal of the U.N. talks. Global temperatures have already risen about 0.8 degrees C (1.3 F), and more heat-trapping gases are emitted every year.  Every degree of warming can cause long-lasting impacts, from melting ice caps and rising sea levels to the loss of species.  ""Human influence on the climate system is clear,"" Rajendra Pachauri, who leads the U.N.'s panel of climate-change experts, told delegates at the opening session in Lima.  To have a decent chance of reversing the warming trend before the planet hits the 2-degree mark, the world needs to slash emissions by 40 percent to 70 percent by 2050 and to near-zero by the end of the century, according to the panel's assessments.  Scientists are practically united in warning that there's no way to meet this goal by continuing business as usual.  It would require a sustained, permanent, worldwide shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to power homes, cars and industries. And even then, the transition might not happen fast enough without a large-scale deployment of new technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  ""We call on the world to ensure the opportunity does not slip away,"" said Nauru's Marlene Moses, representing a group of Pacific island nations threatened by rising seas.  The biggest challenge for the U.N.-sponsored talks is dividing responsibilities between rich Western countries and emerging economies such as China and India. The poorest and most vulnerable nations also need help to develop their economies without aggravating global warming, and to adapt to climate changes that are already causing more violent weather, prolonged droughts and intense flooding.  Among them is host country Peru, whose glaciers are melting ever-faster, threatening water supplies on the coastal desert where 70 percent of its citizens live and threatening the nation's hydropower and food security.  The negotiators in Lima are focusing on a draft agreement that can be refined before the Paris meeting a year from now.  A key issue is what data each government should provide so that formal emissions targets can be compared.  Developing countries also want rich nations to make good on promises of financing to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change impacts, which range from the spread of diseases to coastal flooding to major disruptions to agriculture.  There's no common agreement on how that money should be used; for example, The Associated Press found that Japan has spent $1 billion of its climate financing on new power plants in Indonesia that burn coal ‹ the top source of man-made emissions. Japan says it improves the environment because the new plans burn cleaner, but critics said coal has no place in climate financing.  The U.N.'s weather agency is expected to present temperature data showing 2014 is shaping up to become the hottest year on record.  Peru is among the hardest-hit countries. The Andean nation has 70 percent of the world's tropical glaciers, which have lost more than a fifth of their mass in just three decades, putting 300,000 highlanders under severe stress as pastures and croplands dry up, the planting cycle becomes more erratic and cold snaps more severe.  Lima is the world's second-largest desert capital after Cairo, Egypt, and its 10 million inhabitants depend on glacial runoff for hydropower and to irrigate crops. Plants and animals are disappearing from Peru's cloud forests, its fisheries are declining and annual floods are more severe.  Yearly economic damage from global warming in Latin America and the Caribbean will reach $100 billion a year by mid-century, according to research done for the Inter-American Development bank.  Collectively, the region causes less than 10 percent of global emissions, and yet its people are already bearing an oversized burden.  ""The people with the least intensive climate lifestyles are suffering the most,"" said geographer Jeffrey Bury of The University of California at Santa Cruz, who studies the social and economic impacts of glacier loss.  ""I think we can use the Andes high mountain environment,"" he said, ""to understand what the future holds for the rest of us.""",,extra,2,Dec,2014,HDU,Reporter,Akanksha Jain,new Delhi,"What are the Centre and States doing to curb climate change, asks NGT","The National Green Tribunal on Monday sought response from the Centre, States and Union Territories about the measures they have been adopting to check climate change and how the governments have implemented the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).

of Connecticut,,D5,,,T7,,,,,,,8DEG,,Default,,,,,,"Climate change could drive to extinction as many as one in six animal and plant species, according to a new analysis.  In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Mark Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, also found that as the planet warms in the future, species will disappear at an accelerating rate.  _We have the choice,Ó he said in an interview. _The world can decide where on that curve they want the future Earth to be.Ó  As dire as Dr. Urbanês conclusions are, other experts said the real toll may turn out to be even worse. The number of extinctions _may well be two to three times higher,Ó said John J. Wiens, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. Global warming has raised the planetês average surface temperature about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution. Species are responding by shifting their ranges.  In 2003, Camille Parmesan of the University of Texas and Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University analyzed studies of more than 1,700 plant and animal species. They found that, on average, their ranges shifted 3.8 miles per decade toward the planetês poles.  If emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to grow, climate researchers project the world could warm by as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit. As the climate continues to change, scientists fear, some species wonêt be able to find suitable habitats.  For example, the American pika, a hamsterlike mammal that lives on mountains in the West, has been retreating to higher elevations in recent decades. Since the 1990s, some pika populations along the speciesê southernmost ranges have vanished.  Hundreds of studies published over the past two decades have yielded a wide range of predictions regarding the number of extinctions that will be caused by global warming. Some have predicted few extinctions, while others have predicted that 50 percent of species face oblivion.  There are many reasons for the wide variation. Some scientists looked only at plants in the Amazon, while others focused on butterflies in Canada. In some cases, researchers assumed just a couple of degrees of warming, while in others they looked at much hotter scenarios. Because scientists rarely were able to say just how quickly a given species might shift ranges, they sometimes produced a range of estimates.  To get a clearer picture, Dr. Urban decided to revisit every climate extinction model ever published. He threw out all the studies that examined just a single species, such as the American pika, on the grounds that these might artificially inflate the result of his meta-analysis. (Scientists often pick out individual species to study because they already suspect they are vulnerable to climate change.)  Dr. Urban ended up with 131 studies examining plants, amphibians, fish, mammals, reptiles and invertebrates spread out across the planet. He reanalyzed all the data in those reports.  Overall, he found that 7.9 percent of species were predicted to become extinct from climate change. Estimates based on low levels of warming yielded much fewer extinctions than hotter scenarios.  By his calculation, with an increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit in surface temperature, 5.2 percent of species would become extinct. At 7.7 degrees, 16 percent would.  Newsletter Sign UpContinue reading the main story Science Times Weêll bring you stories that capture the wonders of the human body, nature and the cosmos.   Enter your email address  Sign Up  You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.  SEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME Dr. Urban found that the rate of extinctions would not increase steadily, but would accelerate if temperatures rose.  Richard Pearson, a biogeographer at University College London, called the new meta-analysis _an important line in the sand that tells us we know enough to see climate change as a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems.Ó  But he said that Dr. Urban was likely underestimating the scale of extinctions. The latest generation of climate extinction models are more accurate, Dr. Pearson said: sadly, they also produce more dire estimates.  Dr. Wiens also noted that the tropics have been underrepresented in climate extinction studies. In Dr. Urbanês meta-analysis, 78 studies focused on species in North America and Europe, while only seven came from South America. Yet when Dr. Urban combined all the data from South American studies, he found that 23 percent of species were at risk of extinction. In North America, by contrast, only 5 percent faced extinction.  What makes this imbalance all the more glaring, Dr. Wiens said, is the fact that most of the planetês species live in tropical forests such as the Amazon. If climate extinction research took tropical diversity into account, the planetês overall risk would be much higher.  Dr. Urban acknowledged that his meta-analysis is far from the final word. _This is a summary of the best information we have right now,Ó he said. As predictions improve, Dr. Urban said, they will allow conservation biologists to pinpoint the species at greatest risk of extinction and help plan strategies to save them.  The scientists building these new models may be able to draw from data not just on living species, but extinct ones as well.  In this weekês issue of Science, an international team of scientists reported a new finding on ocean extinctions over the past 23 million years.  They found that some groups, such as marine mammals, have been far more prone to extinctions than others, such as mollusks. Biology can put certain species at extra risk: they may produce few offspring, for instance, or have a limited range.  Dr. Pearson said that climate extinction models will need to take other factors into account, as well. _What happens to other species in an ecosystem when a species goes extinct?Ó he asked. Its partners in that habitat might risk extinction as well.  Dr. Urban saw many other ways in which climate extinction models should improve. For one thing, they should take into account the cities, farms and other barriers that humans have put in the way of species seeking new habitats.  Given the stark results of research so far, Dr. Urban said, these new prediction models canêt come too soon. _We need to elevate our game,Ó he said.",,,2,May,2015,HT,Reporter,Snehal Rebello,"Mumbai, New delhi",Changing monsoon patterns call for new farm practices,"A changing monsoon has pushed Indiaês agriculture sector towards a tipping point and it must now be prepared to switch to a new system to keep feeding a billion-plus people.

Prices in the EUês Emissions Trading System, the worldês biggest carbon market, have dropped from 30 euros a metric ton in 2008 to around 7 euros, due to an oversupply of carbon permits and reduced demand after the economic slowdown.  _Markets will have a role to play in lowering the cost of mitigation worldwide ... Exactly how that is going to function and under what rules and what circumstances remains to be decided,Ó U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said in an interview at a carbon industry event in Barcelona last week.  KEY APPROACH  The draft of the U.N. deal includes an option to acknowledge that _carbon pricing is a key approach for cost-effectiveness of the cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions,Ó but offers little detail on how it might work.  The U.N.ês final deal is unlikely to include strong calls for carbon pricing, said officials meeting in the German city of Bonn this week to prepare for the Paris conference.  Substantive measures to create an international system may be absent.  The Paris accord may do little more than call on governments to nationally implement carbon pricing systems and include a mandate to consider rules for international mechanisms, Hoehne said.  Around 40 countries already have a price on carbon emissions, covering around 12 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, said the World Bank.  Some countries questioned the oil companiesê push for carbon pricing.  _They spread a lot of misinformation,Ó said Abdullahi Majeed, environment minister of the Maldives, the Indian Ocean island nation whose low topography makes it a potential victim of rising sea levels. _This might be an attempt to delay, rather than speed up, work on a Paris accord.Ó",,,3,Jun,2015,ET,PTI,,new Delhi,Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu calls for concerted efforts to tackle climate change,"Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu today called for concerted efforts across the world to address the issue of climate change.

The plan calls for relying slightly less on nuclear power than on renewable energy following the 2011 Fukushima disaster.  Using 2013 as a baseline, Japanês 26 percent cut would be higher than an 18 to 21 percent cut by the United States by 2025 and a 24 percent cut by the European Union by 2030.  Japan - the worldês fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases - saw its emissions rise to 1.41 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, the second-highest on record, in the year through March 2014. That was up 10.8 percent from 1990, reflecting a rise in coal-fired power after the indefinite closure of nuclear power plants.  Green activists and some other countries that are calling for even bigger cuts say Japan will be blamed by global communities not only for a low target, but also for plans to build more coal-fired plants at home.  The trade ministry on Thursday said the government would plan to make nuclear energy account for 20 to 22 percent of Japanês electricity mix in 2030, versus 30 percent before Fukushima. It set the target for renewable energy at 22 to 24 percent of the mix, liquefied natural gas at 27 percent and coal at 26 percent.  Japanês Federation of Electric Power Companies, whose members include the 10 main power monopolies, and 25 other firms said on Friday they had voluntarily set a goal to curb CO2 emissions per 1 kilowatt of power by 35 percent from 2013 levels to around 0.37 kg in 2030.  By installing fossil fuel-fired plants using the best available technology, the power companies see a potential to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 11 million tonnes a year, they said.  The Paris summit in November aims to finalize an agreement as part of efforts to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

Heêll kick off the visit Monday with a speech to a State Department-hosted conference on climate change and the Arctic.  The unambiguous goal of the presidentês trip is to use dramatic and alarming changes to Alaskaês climate to instill fresh urgency into his global warming agenda. Sea ice is melting, critical permafrost is thawing and Alaskaês cherished glaciers are liquefying _ powerful visuals that Obama hopes will illustrate the threat to natural wonders and livelihoods and serve as a global call to action.  _This is all real,Ó Obama said in his weekly address released Saturday. _This is happening to our fellow Americans right now.Ó  Yet Obama has taken steps that show heês cautiously navigating the competing environmental and energy interests at play. A few weeks ago, his administration gave Royal Dutch Shell a final permit to drill into oil-bearing rock off Alaskaês northwest coast for the first time in more than two decades.  _The president has made great strides in protecting the Arctic, but we are really disappointed with this decision,Ó said Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society. _This is a point where we disagree.Ó  For many Alaskans, though, the issue comes down to dollars and cents. Both the state government and its residents rely deeply on oil revenues to stay afloat, and falling oil prices have already created a serious budget deficit.  Brian Deese, Obamaês senior adviser, sought to strike a balance between Alaskaês economics needs and the presidentês goal to eventually phase out fossil fuels. _Thatês a transition that is not going to happen overnight,Ó Deese said. In the meantime, he added, _oil and gas will remain important parts of our overall energy mix.Ó  Ahead of Obamaês visit, state Republican leaders emphasized the need for more energy development and urged Obama not to exploit the stateês stunning scenery for political purposes. Sen. Dan Sullivan warned that any national or ocean monument designations _will go over like a lead balloonÓ among Alaskaês Democrats and Republicans alike.  _What thereês concern about is that heês going to use Alaska as some green screen for climate change, when he doesnêt take the opportunity to dig into other issues that are important to Alaskans, important to the country,Ó Sullivan said in an interview.  Obama has been investing time on an unfinished global climate treaty that nations hope to finalize in December, as he works to secure his environmental legacy before his presidency ends. The president has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and plans to use the Alaska visit to build public pressure on other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.  After arriving in Anchorage on Monday afternoon, Obama plans to meet with Alaska Natives before addressing the Arctic climate resilience summit, dubbed GLACIER, which involves Arctic and non-Arctic leaders, scientists, environmental advocates and the energy industry. Secretary of State John Kerry, a key player in the climate treaty talks, also plans to speak.  In an unusual presidential photo-op, Obama will travel Tuesday to Seward, on Alaskaês Kenai Peninsula, where the Exit Glacier is retreating in what environmentalists say is a dramatic sign of warming temperatures. After hiking to the glacier, Obama is to board a U.S. Coast Guard vessel to tour Kenai Fjords National Park.  His visit continues Wednesday in Dillingham, in southwest Alaska, where Obama will meet with fishermen locked in an ongoing conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the worldês largest salmon fishery. Then heêll fly north to Kotzebue, a regional hub in the Alaska Arctic, where Obama will focus on the plight of rural, native villages where livelihoods are threatened by encroaching climate change.  While in Alaska, Obama is likely to face calls from Democrats and environmentalists to restrict Arctic drilling and to renew his request to Congress to make more of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, off-limits as well. Republicans and energy advocates planned to urge the president to clear the way for more drilling.  Aside from brief campaign stops, few presidents have spent significant time in Alaska.

REUTERS/Stringer Those announcements, as well emission-reduction commitments from more than a dozen U.S. states and cities, will form part of a joint declaration that municipal and regional leaders from the worldês two biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries will sign during a U.S.-China meeting on low-carbon cities in Los Angeles on Tuesday and Wednesday.  The summit builds on a key climate change deal reached last November between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in which the United States agreed to lower greenhouse emissions as much as 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and China pledged that its emissions would peak by 2030, according to the White House.  _The commitments that the Chinese and American cities are taking ... are a very important component of our broader efforts to deepen climate cooperation and to show that ... the two largest emitters in the world are taking seriously our obligation to meet the ambitious goals that we set out last year,Ó said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama.  Xi is visiting the United States next week, at a time when both countries are sparring over cybersecurity, an issue Obama is expected to raise.  But climate change is one area where the two countries largely see eye to eye, a fact the White House is happy to highlight.  Deese said the actions that local leaders will announce were meant to demonstrate how both countries can implement the national targets they pledged jointly last year.  Two of Chinaês biggest cities, Beijing and Guangzhou, have committed to a peak for their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, 10 years earlier than the national target. Others, including Shenzhen, have pledged to peak by 2022.  Cities and provinces that have made such commitments have formed an Alliance of Peaking Pioneer Cities, which represents one-quarter of Chinaês urban carbon emissions, or the equivalent of all Japanês or Brazilês emissions, according to the White House.  Some of the biggest critics of President Obamaês climate change strategy in the U.S. Congress had criticized his agreement with Xi last year. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said the pact _requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 yearsÓ while U.S. states were forced to cut their emissions.  Cities including Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta as well as states such as California and Connecticut also re-affirmed a variety of climate change goals, including emission-reduction targets, mandates to expand renewable energy, and slashing the use of transportation fuels.",,extra,16,Sept,2015,FE,PTI,,New Delhi,Javadekar stresses on R&D for sustainability,He said that Climate Change and Sustainability have become business for western countries as they have developed new technologies for it.,http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/javadekar-stresses-on-r-d-for-sustainability-115091500516_1.html,http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/javadekar-stresses-on-r-d-for-sustainability-115091500516_1.html,IPL,,IP,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC1,,Javedekar at CII,,ID2,,,IT8,,,,,,,,MIT,,,,,,,,,,30,Sept,2015,ET,PTI,,New Delhi,"Ahead of Paris climate meet, FICCI shares views on mitigation with government","Industry body FICCI has shared with the government its perspectives on mitigation and adaptation measures and voluntary emission cuts, days before India submits its INDC ahead of a crucial climate change summit in Paris.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ahead-of-paris-climate-meet-ficci-shares-views-on-mitigation-with-government/articleshow/49154007.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ahead-of-paris-climate-meet-ficci-shares-views-on-mitigation-with-government/articleshow/49154007.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,PBZ,,BZ,IP,,IND,IA1,IB8,IC5,,FICCI INDC submission,,ID6,,,IT6,,,BP,INDC,,,,M&A,,,,,COP,,,,,30,Sept,2015,ET,PTI,,New York,"Shun negatives, adopt positive agenda on climate change: PM Narendra Modi","Asking nations to shun negativism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong pitch for a positive agenda to tackle climate change in his talks with US President Barack Obama who said India's leadership at the Paris conference will set the tone for decades to come.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/shun-negatives-adopt-positive-agenda-on-climate-change-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/49152651.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/shun-negatives-adopt-positive-agenda-on-climate-change-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/49152651.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,GPT,,GP,,,IND,IA1,B3,IC1,,Modi Obama meet,,ID2,,,IT4,,,BP,DCDI,F&T,,,MIT,,,,,COP,,,,,30,Sept,2015,BS,Reporter,Abhineet Kumar & Sanjay Jog,mumbai,Foreign investment push into renewable energy segment,"Investments of up to Rs 40,000 crore expected in next 2 years;

The G.O.P. can plausibly argue, said Karsner, that it was Bush who, in 2007, created the _major economiesÓ strategy to address climate change through precisely the kind of market-enabled, voluntary national targets adopted in Paris.  _The price of getting this issue behind us may never again be this cheap,Ó Karsner said of the G.O.P. _Congressional leaders need to evaluate the opportunity they have to reconnect with mainstream voters, scientific, civic and business leaders, geopolitical strategists and most anyone under 35 years old whoês completed eighth-grade science.Ó  With the earth on pace to add two billion more people by 2050, who will all want cars and homes, and with scientists saying the only way to stay below the 2 degrees C redline is to phase out all fossil fuels by roughly the same date, there is only one force big enough to do that ‹ to take on Mother Nature at scale ‹ and thatês Father Greed, a.k.a., the market.  What will make this deal epochal is if the U.S. and China now lead the world in imposing a price on carbon, because only that will take to scale the already significant technology breakthroughs that have happened with wind, solar, batteries, energy efficiency and nuclear power.  Newsletter Sign UpContinue reading the main story Opinion Today Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.   Enter your email address  Sign Up  You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.  SEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY OPT OUT OR CONTACT US ANYTIME _In the last six years,Ó said Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation, a policy research group, _solar prices have dropped by more than 80 percent, and now cost less than a new coal plant. Wind is down 60 percent, and LED lights more than 90 percent.Ó With other new technologies near at hand _it becomes clear that a clean future costs no more than a dirty one,Ó he said. _Texas now has the most wind installed of any U.S. state.

That is not an accident, he said, considering that recent deals from Morocco to South Africa to Chile were struck for around 2.8 cents a kilowatt-hour of wind and 4.2 cents a kW-h for solar, making them highly competitive with fossil fuel.  _In Chile,Ó said Entrecanales, _there was [just] an auction which was technology agnostic, so the government was offering big bunches of energy to be supplied over the next 10 years, 20 years, and all the energy awarded was renewable. Not one single megawatt hour of conventional energy was supplied.Ó  But, he stressed, leveraging the Paris consensus to get a price on carbon in the big emitting countries is the _Holy Grail,Ó the thing that tips everything. Because while renewables can win against new fossil fuel plants, old fossil fuel plants built without any pollution control, and with all their capital expense amortized and still enjoying subsidies, can still run very cheaply ‹ if you donêt count their massive carbon impacts.  A price on carbon, said Entrecanales, _would drive technology, it would drive R&D, it would drive investment, it would drive consumer habits.Ó So Paris was necessary.

Global warming amplified the likelihood of the ""once-in-a-century"" heavy flooding - responsible for some Ñ600 in insured losses during the winter of 2013/2014 - by more than 40%, researchers reported. ""We found that extreme rainfall, as seen in January 2014, is more likely to occur in a changing climate,"" said Nathalie Shaller, lead author and a scientist at Oxford University. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, is part of a growing body of scientific literature seeking to connect the dots between long-term warming and extreme weather events. It is a difficult case to establish. The main reason is that climate trends are measured in decades or longer, making it very hard - when trying to tease out cause and effect - to separate natural weather variability from human-induced warming. In the new study, two-thirds of the additional risk of major catastrophe could be traced to an increase in the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere, and one third to more days with winds coming across the Atlantic from the west, the study concluded. Climate models predict that both these patterns become more frequent under global warming conditions, the researchers noted. Unlike previous attempts to link climate change with specific extreme weather events, Shaller and colleagues traced the connections ""all the way from the changes in the atmosphere to the impacts on the ground,"" she told AFP by phone. Flood potential Starting with an analysis of circulation in the atmosphere, they also looked at the additional risk of rainfall, as well as swollen river flows. The final step, she said, was calculating flood potential in the Thames River Basin, right down to ""the number of properties at risk,"" she said.

Since 2014, Aedes aegypti, known as the _yellow feverÓ mosquito, has been the main carrier of Zika across Brazil, Columbia and other parts of Latin America, where it has infected several million people, according to the World Health Organization.   The second species, Aedes albopictus, is similarly found along the worldês tropical belt, but unlike aegypti has also colonised some 20 countries in southern Europe since the early 1990s.  In the northern hemisphere, mosquitoes are most active during summer months, disappearing every winter. In the warm, moist tropics, they thrive year-round.  Over the last decade, the newly arrived albopictus has caused small outbreaks in southern Europe of dengue and chikungunya -- viral diseases that provoke high fever, headaches, muscular pain and, in rare cases, death.   Humans infecting mosquitoes  Laboratory tests have shown that albopictus is also -- in the jargon of mosquito experts -- _competentÓ to carry Zika, and could drive its spread in Europe.  _The threat we are facing is that we will see the Zika virus in Europe next summer,Ó said Anna-Bella Failloux, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur, which will co-host the April 25-26 meeting.  Any outbreaks would likely remain localised, she said, but the fear of microcephaly looms large. In the southern United States, where aegypti is common, the threat is even more immediate.  A virus can be introduced to a new region when a local mosquito picks it up from an infected human -- perhaps someone coming back, in the case of Zika, from a holiday in South America.  If it lives long enough, an infected female mosquito can then spread the virus while consuming the blood she needs to nourish her eggs. Here again, climate change could make things worse, experts say.  It can accelerate the virusê progression from the gut of the mosquito to its saliva -- a bit of which enters the human bloodstream as the insect draws a meal with its needle-like proboscis.  _At warmer temperatures, this time period is shortened, leading to a greater likelihood that transmission will occur before the mosquito dies,Ó said Lyle Petersen, an expert on vector-borne diseases at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado.  Higher temperatures also shorten the time it takes for a mosquito egg to mature into a blood-sucking female.  At 28 degrees Celsius (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), this process happens within nine or 10 days, compared to about two weeks at 25 C (77 F). Viruses also tend to reproduce more quickly the warmer it gets.   Globalisation of mosquitoes  When it comes to the spread of mosquitoes and the viruses they carry, global warming is not the only -- or even the biggest -- driver, scientists point out.  _It is important, but increased international travel and trade -- globalisation, in short -- are even more important,Ó said Herve Zeller, head of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Controlês emerging and vector-borne disease programme. Ever larger numbers of travellers are at risk every day of being bitten by an diseased mosquito and taking the virus home with them while they are still infectious.  Population density and access to clean water and living conditions are also key factors, and a major reason -- besides a more temperate climate -- that outbreaks in developing countries will continue to be more severe.  Mosquitoes flourish in bodies of stagnant water in densely-populated settlements typical to poor, urban communities.  In the absence of a vaccine or cure for Zika, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid getting bitten, experts say.  Prevention efforts must focus on eliminating the insects and their breeding sites. -AFP   Read more at http://www.thestar.com.my/news/environment/2016/04/19/climate-change-may-boost-spread-of-zika/#DKUk7vIZRIwfDOMW.99",,,30,Apr,2016,HDU,PTI,,Bhopal,UJALA will be implemented across country by 2019: Piyush Goyal,"The Centre's ambitious National LED programme, Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA), will be implemented across the country by 2019, Minister for Power and Coal Piyush Goyal said on Saturday.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ujala-will-be-implemented-across-the-country-by-2019-piyush-goyal/article8542570.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ujala-will-be-implemented-across-the-country-by-2019-piyush-goyal/article8542570.ece,IPE,,IP,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC1,,"Piyush Goel, UJALA scheme",,ID2,,,IT4,,,,,,,,Mit,,,COB BAU,,,,,,repeat,30,Apr,2016,BS,PTI,,Bhopal,UJALA will be implemented across country by 2019: Piyush Goyal,"The Centre's ambitious National LED programme, Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA), will be implemented across the country by 2019, Minister for Power and Coal Piyush Goyal said on Saturday.",http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/ujala-will-be-implemented-across-country-by-2019-goyal-116043000452_1.html,http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/ujala-will-be-implemented-across-country-by-2019-goyal-116043000452_1.html,IPE,,IP,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC1,,"Piyush Goel, UJALA scheme",,ID2,,,IT4,,,,,,,,Mit,,,COB BAU,,,,,,,29,Apr,2016,MNT,opinion,Montek Singh Ahluwalia,,Policies for low carbon development,A low carbon scenario would requite us to take steps to reduce energy use in a number of sectors and also promote a shift to renewable energy.,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/F6GVNfKRWYLx1R4bY9XJPK/Policies-for-low-carbon-development.html,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/F6GVNfKRWYLx1R4bY9XJPK/Policies-for-low-carbon-development.html,IPL,,IP,,,IND,IA5,IB1,IC10,,Goi's RE policy,,,,,IT6,,,BP,ACM,DCM,,,Mit,,,COB BAU,,,,,,,29,Apr,2016,BS,AFP,,Brrussels,EU court overturns carbon market free quotas,"The EU's top court today overturned free quotas for the bloc's carbon market up to 2030, a key part of strategies to curb global warming emissions.",http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/eu-court-overturns-carbon-market-free-quotas-116042900032_1.html,http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/eu-court-overturns-carbon-market-free-quotas-116042900032_1.html,CM,GPBZ,GP,,,EU,A1,B11,C11,,EU COURTS,,D11,,,T6,,,,,,,,Mit,,,,,,,,,Extra,29,Apr,2016,BS,AFP,,Geneva,Workers feeling heat as climate change slashes productivity',"Climate change is exposing millions of workers to excessive heat, risking their health and income and threatening to erase more than USD 2.0 trillion in annual productivity by 2030, a UN report warned today.",http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/workers-feeling-heat-as-climate-change-slashes-productivity-116042900035_1.html,http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/workers-feeling-heat-as-climate-change-slashes-productivity-116042900035_1.html,GS,,S,,,GLO,A1,B4,C2,,"UN REPORT, climate Change and Labour: Impacts of Heat in the Workplace.",,D5,,,T1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,May,2016,ET,No byline,,Kolkata,Higher coal use in Asia may lead to reduced rainfall: Study,"Rapid increase of coal use in fast-growing Asian countries such as India and China may weaken monsoon systems and reduce the amount of rainfall in future, a new MIT study has found.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52073502.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52073502.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst,IS,,S,,,IND,IA2,B1,C6,,"Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling, Singapore-MIT Alliance  Read more at:",,D5,,,T6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,May,2016,HDU,Opinion,Shyam Saran,,A long and hot summer ahead by Shyam Saran,"India has already made substantial concessions to enable a consensus for the Paris pact.

But experts say that the slow process measured in inches of glacial retreat per year also can lead to a sudden, dramatic tragedy.  The melting of glaciers like Peru's Pastoruri has put cities like Huaraz, located downslope from the glacier about 35 miles (55 kilometers) away, at risk from what scientists call a ""glof"" ‹ glacial lake outburst flood.  A group of tourists ride horses to the Pastoruri glacier in a tour called ""The Route of Climate Change"" in Huaraz, Peru, Aug. 12, 2016. A group of tourists ride horses to the Pastoruri glacier in a tour called ""The Route of Climate Change"" in Huaraz, Peru, Aug. 12, 2016. A glof occurs when the weak walls of a mountain valley collapse under the weight of meltwater from a glacier. Recent examples include the rapid draining in 2013 of a lake at Chile's Ventisquero glacier in the Bernardo O'Higgins National Park, six years after another, nearby lake essentially disappeared there.  Those sites are in remote, sparsely populated Patagonia. But if the glacial Palcacocha lake collapsed, it could cause a damaging flood, say experts in Peru, sort of like a smaller, modern cousin of the ancient glof that is thought to have carved the English Channel.  ""As glaciers disappear around the world, there is less water available for use for hydroelectric power, as a renewable resource for agriculture, for human consumption,"" said Benjamin Orlove, a professor of international and public affairs at Colombia University in New York. ""The glacier retreat also brings many disasters. Entire slopes are destabilized, creating landslides that travel many miles and have destroyed entire towns.""  Benjamin Morales Arnao, the head of Peru's National Institute for Glacier Research, said that while the country's glaciers ""are a source of life, due to their water resources and biodiversity ... these glaciers are also a source of glacial catastrophes.""  The problem is that glacial lakes are often fragile structures, created when rocks and rubble carried by a glacier form a moraine that dams up its water outflow. The dam can also be created by chunks of a glacier's own ice. These inherently unstable structures can collapse quickly, especially in a place like Peru that is prone to frequent, violent earthquakes.  At a conference last week on the glacier retreat in Peru, Morales Arnao said that Huaraz, a city of about 100,000 people, is particularly at risk from Palcacocha lake, just 12 miles (20 kilometers) up the mountain above the city, and called for resources to mitigate the risk. Dams, spillways and other waterworks have helped in other places.  FILE - Members of the glaciology unit of Peru's national water authority walk on the Pastoruri glacier in Huaraz, Peru, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. FILE - Members of the glaciology unit of Peru's national water authority walk on the Pastoruri glacier in Huaraz, Peru, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. Massive glofs have occurred regularly in sparsely populated parts of Iceland and other nations.  The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, a regional intergovernmental research center that serves the eight countries of the Himalayas, said that in Nepal ‹ whose proximity to the highest and largest meltwater sources in the world makes it particularly vulnerable ‹ ""little attention was paid to the phenomenon until the sudden outburst of the Dig Tsho,"" a relatively small meltwater lake in the Mount Everest National Park.  On Aug. 4, 1985, the lake's moraine dam collapsed, and all its water drained into a downstream valley in four hours, causing losses as far as 30 to 35 miles (50 to 60 kilometers) downstream.  A large ice and rock avalanche had cascaded into the lake, creating a wave that spilled over the moraine and caused it to collapse, the center's report said. ""It discharged an estimated 6 to 10 million cubic meters (as much as 2.6 billion gallons) of water into the valley below.""  Digging stone- or cement-lined channels through glacial dams is one solution to the threat. Many moraine dams collapse because meltwater erodes them by seepage or over-topping them. Stopping global warming that is increasingly causing glaciers to melt is another.  Experts at the International Forum on Glaciers and Mountain Ecosystems held in Huaraz last week concluded that the world is going to have to plan on melting glaciers, at least for the time being.  ""The processes of climate change and glacial melting are irreversible,"" the forum said in its conclusions. ""We have to carry out actions to adapt, and mitigate the risks.""  ""The long-term solution is for the world to shift to different energy sources, sources that are renewable, sources that do not emit gases that cause climate change,"" Orlove said. ""In the short term we have to find adaptations, like installing early warning systems for disasters in the most sensitive areas.""",,,16,Aug,2016,DNA,PTI,,,New vegetation map of Earth unveils monumental changes since 1980,"Researchers have developed a new system to map the world's ""biomes"" -

But delivering on his campaign pledges to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and bring back tens of thousands of long-gone coal mining jobs could prove far more difficult.  Internal documents from the president-elect's transition team reviewed by The Associated Press show the new administration plans to stop defending the Clean Power Plan and other recent Obama-era environmental regulations that have been the subject of long-running legal challenges filed by Republican-led states and the fossil fuel industry.  Against that potential opposition, environmental groups are gearing up to defend Obama's environmental legacy in court.  ""We anticipate challenging every single attempt to roll back regulations on air, water and climate,"" said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who added that his group is already hiring additional lawyers. Fundraising for environmental causes also has spiked since Trump's victory.  Though Republicans have for years blamed environmental regulations for the decline of coal, data from the U.S. Department of Energy shows the primary cause is the emergence of cheaper, more abundant natural gas from hydraulic fracturing. Another factor is the plummeting cost of solar panels and wind turbines, which now can produce emissions-free electricity cheaper than burning coal.  Leading Trump's transition team on the EPA is Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that gets financial support from the fossil fuel industry and that opposes ""global-warming alarmism.""  Though his academic credentials are in philosophy and political theory, Ebell is an enthusiastic denier of the voluminous scientific data that show the planet is warming and that burning fossil fuels is primarily to blame.  Trump said during the campaign he would ""cancel"" the Paris agreement to make global reductions in carbon emissions that Obama signed in December.  The agreement was not a treaty and was not approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, and legal experts agree that as president Trump would have the authority to walk away. Even without a formal withdrawal, Trump could simply order EPA not to take any action toward meeting the U.S. commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels within the next 10 years.  Trump appeared to soften his position in a recent interview with The New York Times, saying he now has an ""open mind"" about the Paris agreement. He also shifted away from his year-long insistence that climate change is a ""hoax,"" conceding there may be ""some connectivity"" between human activity and the warming of the planet.  Still, Trump's advisers have suggested he will eliminate NASA's world-class climate research program, which tracks the warming of the planet, melting Arctic sea ice and rising oceans using an array of purpose-built satellites orbiting the globe.  However, NASA's study of earth science is currently mandated by federal law, which means voiding the program would require congressional action. Even assuming unanimous Republican support, Senate Democrats could block such an effort through a filibuster.  As a legal matter, Trump also can't simply get rid of the EPA. Though established in 1970 by President Richard Nixon through an executive order, eliminating a federal Cabinet agency would require congressional approval and face a likely filibuster.  Even without a wholesale elimination, Trump and the GOP-led Congress could gut the agency's budget - defunding core enforcement efforts enshrined under the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. During the campaign, Trump proposed slashing the EPA's $8 billion budget as a way to offset some of the cost of his planned tax cuts.  Environmentalists and former EPA officials say decades of gains made under both Democratic and Republican administrations would potentially be lost if Trump weakens the agency. Christie Todd Whitman, a Republican who served as EPA administrator under President George W. Bush, worries EPA is likely to suffer a brain drain as key regulatory staff retire or resign rather than serve under Trump.  ""It would behoove Republicans to remember EPA was signed into law by a Republican president working with a Democratic Congress because the public wanted to protect the environment,"" Whitman said. ""They wanted clean air to breathe, they were tired of seeing rivers spontaneously combust and the land turned into a garbage dump.""  Internal transition documents show Trump's primary targets are Clean Power Plan limits on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants and a recent EPA rule expanding the definition of ""waters of the United States"" protected under the Clean Water Act to include smaller creeks and wetlands. Other items include EPA's recently issued standards for reducing smog caused by coal-fired power plants and limits on harmful emissions and chemical-laden waste water from oil and gas operations.  Dismantling EPA regulations is difficult, especially if the rules have already been finalized and implemented.  ""The agency has already built up a very strong record to support those rules,"" said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School. ""It can be very hard to do an about-face.""",,,3,Dec,2016,ET,PTI,,Geneva,WTO seeks trade deal on environmentally friendly 'green' products,"The green products include solar panels, wind turbines and

The ministry said in a statement that the draft reform proposal adopted by the EU members was _not binding.Ó  Warsaw is arguing that EU treaties say rules on a countryês choice between different energy sources can only be adopted with the unanimous consent of the blocês 28 nations.  Polish diplomats contested Tuesdayês compromise deal on the grounds that the draft text should have been brought to a vote, insisting the nine member states made up a _blocking minority.Ó  Malta, which holds the EUês rotating presidency, said there was no need for a formal vote on Tuesday because EU nations were only adopting a common approach to begin negotiations with European Parliament - the last leg in EU legislation process.  _To be clear, the (European) Council has not adopted a formal act on the ETS review. This means that the Council did not proceed to a formal vote. Therefore, there is no basis for claiming that the wrong voting rules were used,Ó a spokesman for the Maltese presidency said.  He said a qualified majority of EU countries had backed the compromise text to start the negotiations with the European Parliament.  A minimum of 16 member states is required to back the compromise deal, representing at least 65 percent of the total EU population.

reports that President Donald Trump plans to pull the United States from a global accord on fighting climate change.  The market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a U.S. exit from the Paris Climate Agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the United States.  Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal company dropped 2.2 percent to $24.29 a share, while Arch Coal fell 0.4 percent to $70.77.  A spokesman for Peabody said the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the _accord is flawed on a number of levels.Ó  Cloud Peak Energy Inc had also urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris deal to prevent other nations from an aggressive turn against the global coal industry. Its shares were down 0.6 percent to $3.39.      A spokesman for Cloud Peak declined to comment.  A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that Trump is planning to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a move designed to help boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth, after weeks of deliberations on the issue.  Trump did not confirm the decision, but said he would make an announcement _over the coming daysÓ.  The logo and trading symbol for U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp. are displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid CAMPAIGN PLEDGE  A U.S. withdrawal would come over the objections of scores of big U.S. corporations - from Wal-Mart to Exxon Mobil - worried the move will complicate the business landscape instead of bolstering the economy.  _For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change,Ó Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the companyês annual general meeting on Wednesday. Exxon had made that case in a recent letter to the White House, he said.  Exxon dipped 0.7 percent, ConocoPhillips declined 0.2 percent, and Chevron Corp fell 0.6 percent. Crude oil prices fell to a three-week low on news that recovering Libyan output boosted OPEC crude output in May.  Solar energy shares also got hit on Wednesday, with First Solar Inc down 2.5 percent, and SunPower Corp each down 3.4 percent.  _Regardless of what the President decides on the accord, we expect Americaês solar industry to continue to thrive and create jobs, boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,Ó the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement.  Shares of Tesla Inc, which recently acquired SolarCity, were up 1.8 percent at $341.01.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he had done _all I canÓ to convince Trump to stay in the Paris accord, and threatened to leave White House advisory councils if Trump announces a U.S. exit.  Trump campaigned on a promise to unravel Obama-era climate regulations to help boost domestic oil, gas and coal production. Company executives, economists, and analysts have expressed skepticism, however, that his deregulatory agenda can alter existing trends away from coal.  U.S. carbon emissions have declined to near 30-year lows, a trend driven by increased natural gas use replacing coal.  The VanEck Vectors Coal exchange-traded fund fell 1.2 percent to $12.71, not far from a five-month low hit earlier in May. The ETF is on track to fall 7.2 percent this month after rising in the first three months of the year as part of the so-called Trump trade.",,,2,Jun,2017,HBL,PTI,,Washington,ˆ Trump withdraws US from

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch In a defiant speech to parliament a week before she will host a summit of the worldês top economic powers in Hamburg, the northern port city where she was born, Merkel did not mention Trump by name but said global problems could not be solved with protectionism and isolation.  Her remarks raised the prospect of an open clash with Trump at the summit. She later met with European G20 leaders who promised to present a united front in Hamburg, while making clear they preferred compromise to conflict.  _These will not be easy talks,Ó Merkel said. _The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they arenêt there. I simply wonêt do this.Ó  The G20 summit will be held a little over a month after a G7 summit in Sicily exposed deep divisions between other western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration.  A short while later, Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris.  Ahead of the G20 summit, Trumpês administration has threatened to take punitive trade measures against China, including introducing tariffs on steel imports.   ADVERTISING   This has made for an unusually tense atmosphere before the summit and German officials acknowledge they have little idea what the final communique will look like.  Asked about Merkelês comments, Trumpês national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. relationship with Germany was _as strong as everÓ and played down the discord.  _Of course there are going to be differences in relations with any country, and weêll talk frankly about those differences. The president enjoys those conversations,Ó McMaster told reporters.  The German hosts face a difficult challenge. Along with Trump, Russiaês Vladimir Putin and Turkeyês Tayyip Erdogan will be attending. All have strained relations with Merkel and other European leaders.  The summit, in a convention center in the heart of Hamburg, could also be disrupted by tens of thousands of protesters expected to descend on the city of 1.7 million.  EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE  Merkel said she was _more determined than everÓ to make the Paris accord a success since Trumpês decision to pull out, calling climate change an _existential challengeÓ.  _We cannot wait until every last person on Earth has been convinced of the scientific proof,Ó she said.  _Anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a big mistake,Ó Merkel said.  Trump looks forward to discussing his economic rationale for quitting the deal during his G20 meetings, said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser.  _Heês going to ask for a fair and level playing field. We cannot be in a position where the United States is cutting and cutting emissions while others continue to grow,Ó Cohn told reporters.  French President Emmanuel Macron, in Berlin for the meeting of EU leaders, which included the prime ministers of Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain, said he hoped the United States would _return to reasonÓ on climate. But he also stressed that it made little sense to try to isolate Trump in Hamburg.  _The relationship with the United States is a long-term one and it is deep,Ó Macron said. _I believe we must continue an intense dialogue with the United States because of these ties which are historic and enduring.Ó  At Macronês invitation, Trump will visit Paris a week after the July 7-8 G20 summit for Bastille Day celebrations. They spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to work together to respond to any new chemical attacks from the Syrian government.  Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs summits of EU leaders, said in Berlin that European countries would speak with one voice in Hamburg, defending the rules-based international order that Trump has called into question.",,Extra,30,Jun,2017,FE,No byline,,New Delhi,"ˆ As India increasingly eyes renewable, Piyush Goyal says balancing policy against coal tricky","As the country is taking measures to change its energy mix to increase renewable energy contribution, power minister Piyush Goyal acknowledged the contradiction faced by policymakers in the evolving scenario.",http://www.financialexpress.com/economy/as-india-increasingly-eyes-renewable-piyush-goyal-says-balancing-policy-against-coal-tricky/742099/,http://www.financialexpress.com/economy/as-india-increasingly-eyes-renewable-piyush-goyal-says-balancing-policy-against-coal-tricky/742099/,IPE,,IP,,,IND,IA2,IB1,IC1,,RE vs coal in india,,ID2,,,IT6,,,,,,,,Mit,,,,,,,,,Extra,30,Jun,2017,HT,Opinion,Samir Saran,,ˆ Trumpês stand on the Paris climate deal may help India,"Trumpês belligerence towards the Paris accords may ironically become its undoing: By highlighting coal and gas, the US president has turned attention on the need for traditional sources.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/trump-s-stand-on-the-paris-climate-deal-may-help-india/story-2AGS4dMtoYAGpidewWVpEO.html,http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/trump-s-stand-on-the-paris-climate-deal-may-help-india/story-2AGS4dMtoYAGpidewWVpEO.html,MPT,,MP,,,IND,IA5,B3,C1,IC1,Modi-trump meet,,,,,IT3,,,BP,CLP,DTMP,,,mit,,,,,COP,,,,,2,jul,2017,BS,Bloomberg,Karlis Salna,,Barack Obama takes swipe at Donald Trump on Paris climate accord,Former US President Barack Obama has pointed to the importance of the Paris climate accord while criticising Donald Trump for pulling the worldês biggest economy out of the pact.,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-01/obama-in-indonesia-takes-swipe-at-trump-on-paris-climate-accord,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-01/obama-in-indonesia-takes-swipe-at-trump-on-paris-climate-accord,GPT,,GP,,,US,A6,B1,C1,,Obama on Trump pullout of Paris agreement,,D2,,,T8,,,BP,DTMP,,,,,,,,,COP,,"Former U.S. President Barack Obama has pointed to the importance of the Paris climate accord while criticizing Donald Trump for pulling the worldês biggest economy out of the pact.  Trump said last month he would withdraw from the pact and seek to negotiate a better deal, in a move that attracted widespread criticism from counterparts in Europe and elsewhere. The decision by Trump to walk away from the 2015 agreement was also criticized by business leaders, with some describing it as a setback for the environment.  _In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change,Ó Obama said Saturday in a speech at the opening of the Fourth Congress of the Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. He said it was _an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership will still give our children a fighting chance.Ó  _The challenges of our times, whether itês economic inequality, changing climate, terrorism, mass migration; these are really challenges and weêre going to have to confront them together,Ó he said.  Obama, who has been holidaying in Indonesia and on Friday met with President Joko Widodo, also warned in remarks Saturday against rising sectarian politics around the world, as well as growing discrimination based on race and ethnicity.   _There are going to be some big decisions to make about Indonesia and about the United States and about the world in the years to come,Ó he said. _Itês been clear for a while that the world is at a crossroads, at an inflection point.Ó  He said in Jakarta there had been _enormous progressÓ which had occurred _in part because of the stability that the United States helped support here in the Asia Pacific.Ó  Global Challenges  But the former president said there are also challenges, and that globalization and technology had created problems and _shifts in the foundations of societiesÓ and in politics both in developing and developed countries.  _The world is more prosperous than ever before, but this has also brought significant changes that are dangerous.Ó  _We start seeing a rise in sectarian politics, we start seeing a rise in an aggressive kind of nationalism, we start seeing both in developed and developing countries an increased resentment about minority groups and the bad treatment of people who donêt look like us or practice the same faith as us.Ó  _We start seeing discrimination against people based on race or ethnicity or religion.Ó Those threats must be confronted, Obama said.  Obama, who spent four years in Indonesia as a child, met on Friday with Widodo, known as Jokowi, at Bogor on the outskirts of the capital. _I always found Jokowi to be a man of quiet but firm integrity and somebody who sincerely wants whatês right by all Indonesians,Ó he said.  Their meeting touched on issues such as infrastructure and economic development, according to Obama, who said Saturday that the U.S. and Indonesia shared the common values of _pluralism and tolerance and openness and rule of law.Ó",,,2,jul,2017,HDU,PTI,,Washington,¥Heat-resistantê cows of the

univ,,D5,,,T1,,,,,,,,,,,,IPCC,,,"Rising carbon dioxide levels from global warming will drastically reduce the amount of protein in staple crops like rice and wheat, leaving vulnerable populations at risk of growth stunting and early death, experts warned Wednesday.  Researchers say they still don't understand how or why carbon dioxide emissions sap protein and other nutrients from plants, but the mystery is one that could have devastating consequences across the globe.  An additional 150 million people globally may be at risk of protein deficiency by 2050 because of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere said the report in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  The study, led by Harvard University researchers, is the first to quantify the impacts of global warming on the protein levels of crops.  It relies on data from open field experiments in which plants were exposed to high concentrations of CO2.   Global dietary information from the United Nations was used to calculate the impact on people who live dangerously close to the edge when it comes to getting enough protein. Without it, growth is stunted, diseases are more common and early mortality is far more likely.  Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of fossil-fuel burning that helps trap heat around the Earth. Without stark action, these emissions are expected to climb in the decades to come, resulting in rising seas, hotter temperatures and more extreme weather events.  A leading hypothesis was that CO2 might increase the amount of starch in plants, thereby decreasing protein and other nutrients.   But lead author Samuel Myers, a senior research scientist in Harvard University's T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said that experiments did not back up the theory.  ""The short answer is we really have no idea,"" he told AFP.   ""We've looked into it pretty extensively.""   Protein was not the only nutrient to take a major hit.   Other research has shown that rising CO2 will cut key minerals like iron and zinc in staple crops, leading to further nutritional deficiencies worldwide.  Africa, Asia hardest hit  Researchers calculated that by 2050, higher CO2 concentrations will sap the protein contents of barley by 14.6 percent, rice by 7.6 percent, wheat by 7.8 percent, and potatoes by 6.4 percent.  ""If CO2 levels continue to rise as projected, the populations of 18 countries may lose more than 5 percent of their dietary protein by 2050 due to a decline in the nutritional value of rice, wheat, and other staple crops,"" said the report.  A full 76 percent of the people on Earth rely on plants for most of their daily protein, particularly in poor areas of the globe.  The hardest hit areas are expected to be Sub-Saharan Africa, where millions already don't get enough protein in their diets, and South Asia where rice and wheat are common staples.  India alone may lose 5.3 percent of protein from a standard diet, putting a predicted 53 million people at new risk of protein deficiency.  Researchers said solutions may include cutting carbon emissions, supporting more diverse diets, enriching the nutritional content of staple crops, and breeding crops that are less sensitive to the harmful effects of CO2.",,Extra,2,Aug,2017,ET,PTI,,new Delhi,India insisted on dues from global sources to fight climate change: Govt,"India has insisted on its rightful dues from international sources in its fight

It runs through early April.  The consultation will be followed by an impact assessment and drafting of a Commission proposal between April and June, with a final proposal to be presented in the fourth quarter, said Commission spokesman Isaac Valero-Ladron.  IMO HITCH IMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu has called for an impact assessment study on nine different market-based proposals and to finalize it by 2013.  â€œLet us work together and set ourselves the challenge of completing all of the work on the establishment of a market-based measure by a target year of 2015,â€ù he said in his opening speech on Monday.  But the talks were bogged down by a debate about technical cooperation and technology transfer in relation to an agreement on an energy efficiency design index reached last year, delegates said.  Last July, forty eight countries voted in favor of adopting a mandatory energy efficiency design index (EEDI) for new ships and a voluntary energy efficiency management plant for all ships.  â€œThere is bad feeling as a result of that,â€ù said John Maggs, policy advisor at Seas At Risk, a European association of non-governmental environmental organizations.  â€œThose who didnâ€™t support adoption of the EEDI last year are now causing difficulties for further progress on greenhouse gas measures.â€ù  The talks were also held back by a debate about the appointment of a steering group to oversee the commissioning of the impact study, he said, adding â€œwhich as a result of developing country lobbying is now a necessary precursor to making any further progress.â€ù",,,16,Mar,2012,FE,Opinion,Uday Abhyankar,,Equity after Durban,"Anyone hoping for a planet-changing climate agreement at Durban was no doubt disappointed.

'We can do better. We are making our stuff a lot more efficient, and that will get (our carbon emissions) a lot further down.'  Just how climate-damaging is the Internet? By comparison with other sectors, not very - and it can be argued that the Internet saves carbon which would otherwise be emitted in snail mail, phone calls or travel to face-to-face meetings.  A 2007 estimate by Gartner Inc, an international consulting firm, found the information and communications technology industry was sharply increasing its CO2 emissions in absolute terms but still accounted for only around two per cent of the global total.  This is less than a sixth of emissions from either transport, industry or agriculture.  Mr Andy Ridley, Earth Hour's executive director, said his organisation invested in offsets - projects that mitigate carbon emissions - to compensate for its own fossil-fuel pollution.  It was also using an intranet social platform called Yammer to cut down on internal e-mails.  'It has revolutionised how we communicate and very significantly cut the amount of electronic traffic,' Mr Ridley told AFP.  'Overall, we think that our ability to build a campaign digitally, and to engage with people across the planet in a way that minimises travel, is one of the great advantages of technology.",,,30,Mar,2012,TOI,no byline,,new Delhi,40MW solar plant to generate power from Saturday,JAISALMER: Saturday will prove to be a milestone in the field of renewable energy production as Reliance Energy will start power generation of 40MW from its solar energy power project in Rajasthan.

The nitrogen contained in fertilizers and manure is broken down by microbes that live in the soil and released into the atmosphere as N2O.  Davidson believes that N2O emissions can be reduced through better management of fertilizer and manure sources, as well as reducing the developed world's per capita meat consumption to relieve pressure on fertilizer demand and reduce growth in the amount of manure being produced.",No link,repeat,16,Apr,2012,IE,IANS,,Washington,Slashing meat intake vital for curbing emissions,"IANS, Washington: Per capita meat consumption need to be halved by 2050 in the developed world if the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), one of the most important greenhouse gases, is to be curbed, as set out by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).",,:,GPL,,GP,,,GLO,IA1,B4,C6,,Woods hole RESEARCH centre,,D5,,,T1,,,,,,,,Mit,,,,,,,,,,16,Apr,2012,HDU,ANI,,London,Karakoram glaciers bucking global warming trend and â€˜putting on massâ€™,"ANI, London: Some glaciers on Asiaâ€™s Karakoram mountains, which is home to K2, are defying the global trend and getting thicker, a new study has claimed.",http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/article3320401.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/article3320401.ece,GS,,S,,,DC,IA1,B4,C6,,National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Grenoble,,D5,,,T6,,,,,,,,,,,,IPCC,,,,,,16,Apr,2012,ET,Opinion,R K Pachauri,,Tackling climate change: Adapt to changes at local levels but mitigate release of greenhouse gases by R K Pachauri,"Much has been written and discussed recently on the subject of climate change in response to growing scientific evidence that has been assessed and disseminated in recent years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).   Read more at: //economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/12682781.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst",The Economic Times: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/comments-analysis/tackling-climate-change-adapt-to-changes-at-local-levels-but-mitigate-release-of-greenhouse-gases/articleshow/12682781.cms,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/comments-analysis/tackling-climate-change-adapt-to-changes-at-local-levels-but-mitigate-release-of-greenhouse-gases/articleshow/12682781.cms,GS,GPL,S,GP,,GLO,IA5,B3,C2,,IPCC SREX report BY TERI,,ID5,,,IT6,,,,,,,,M&A,,,COB BAU,IPCC SREX,,,,,extra,16,Apr,2012,TOI,Reporter,Namrata Singh,MUMBAI,Pure-play carbon credit companies in crisis,"MUMBAI: The crash in carbon credit prices globally has served a crushing blow to companies operating in this space in India.

It focuses on industrial operations producing more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year.  The nationâ€™s top industry body fought the scheme, saying it would add unnecessary costs and that competitor Japan has yet to put a price on carbon.  The Federation of Korean Industries has said the scheme would add initial costs of 4.7 trillion Korean won ($4.2 billion) even when 95 percent of pollution permits are given for free.  Each permit represents a ton of carbon emissions, with free permits awarded during the schemeâ€™s two first phases, spanning 2015-2017 and 2018-2020. The rest would be auctioned.  The government says the scheme is crucial to reining in emissions from Asiaâ€™s fourth-largest economy, which have doubled since 1990, and to meeting a pledged goal of reducing emissions by 30 percent from projected levels by 2020.  â€œThe opposition had no reason to oppose as they have been supporting the bill. Industry should be the one thatâ€™s mostly worried about the outcome,â€ù Heo Seong-wook, professor of law from Seoul National University, told Reuters, referring to the countryâ€™s powerful industrial conglomerates called chaebols.  Yet despite their political clout, objections from industry have not swayed lawmakers, Heo said, in part because of ongoing talks among political leaders to try to rein in big corporates.  â€œThe parties might be concerned that if they actively support industryâ€™s opinion, they might be seen as not so friendly towards ordinary people,â€ù Heo said.  Many Korean firms, particularly big exporters, remain unconvinced but have nonetheless been preparing, analysts say.  Top emitters include major employers such as POSCO, the worldâ€™s No.3 steelmaker, and Samsung Electronics, the worldâ€™s biggest electronics firm by revenue.  â€œThe news of carbon emission trading would not come as an immediate shock to the steel industry as steelmakers have prepared for the scheme,â€ù an analyst at Daishin Securities, Mun Jeoung-up, said.  Another analyst at Hanwha Securities, Kim Kang-o, said, â€œIf the cost burden accounts for a certain percentage of operating profits, that is a problem ... Whether the industry would pass on the cost to consumers is also an important factor.â€ù",,extra,3,May,2012,ET,Reporter,Shruti Choudhury,,International Antarctic Expedition: A night in Antarctica with Indian Lanterns,"The annual expedition aims to show a cross section of society the effects of climate change first hand, so that they could be inspired to take small",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/international-antarctic-expedition-a-night-in-antarctica-with-indian-lanterns/articleshow/12974190.cms,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/international-antarctic-expedition-a-night-in-antarctica-with-indian-lanterns/articleshow/12974190.cms,ITD,,TD,,,POL,IA2,IB1,IC9,,,,ID7,,,IT4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,extra,3,May,2012,BS,Reporter,Reghu Balakrishnan,MUMBAI,We see a sharp rise in solar and biomass projects: Soumya Banerjee,"Interview with Senior Investment Officer, Infrastructure and Natural Resources, IFC.

New Zealandâ€™s carbon market value grew threefold to $351 million, while the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in North America was nearly halved to $249 million, the bank said.  INTERNATIONAL OFFSETS Secondary trading volumes for international offsets regulated by the United Nations also soared in 2011, rising 43 percent year on year to 1.8 billion units valued at $23 billion.  The main reason for this was a rise in demand for U.N.-backed emissions offsets, because a certain number of the credits can be used for compliance in markets such as the EU  ETS. Average offset prices, which trade at a discount to EU carbon prices, fell 21 percent year on year to $12.8 a tonne, as a record number of credits were issued last year.  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which paves the way for investments in emission-reduction projects in developing nations, is the biggest offset market. It accounted for over 95 percent of total spot and secondary emissions offset trading.  Direct pre-2013 CDM project-based transactions declined to under $1 billion in 2011 from $1.5 billion in the previous year as its 2008-2012 commitment period draws to an end.  However, primary investment in post-2012 CDM offsets, however, rose to nearly $2 billion in 2011 from $1.2 billion, despite depressed prices and uncertainty about the future of the Kyoto Protocol and its market mechanisms such as the CDM.  U.N. climate talks in South Africa last year agreed a package of measures that would extend Kyoto, a global pact enforcing carbon cuts, and decide a new, legally binding accord by 2015, coming into force by 2020.  The World Bank suggested recent and emerging cap-and-trade schemes in Australia, California, Mexico, South Korea and Quebec could contribute to future growth in overall carbon trading.  Primary project-based transactions in the voluntary offset market were valued at $569 million in 2011, up 37 percent, the bank said.",,,30,May,2012,DH,no byline,,mysore,Mysore Declaration' mooted on effects of food pattern,"Mysore: Calling on students and researchers alike to think about the future, JSS Centre for Management Studies (JSS CMS) director V Prakash said it was important to have a â€˜Mysore Declarationâ€™, which would highlight effects on food patterns due to global climate change.http://www.deccanherald.com/content/253304/mysore-declaration-mooted-effects-food.html",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/253304/mysore-declaration-mooted-effects-food.html,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/253304/mysore-declaration-mooted-effects-food.html,IS,,IS,,,IND,IA2,IB1,IC6,,SS Centre for Management Studies (JSS CMS),,D5,,,IT6,,,,,,,,ADpt,,,,,,,,,,28,May,2012,TOI,Reporter,Suresh Sharma,Manali,Global warming: Dozens of streams going dry in Kullu,"MANALI: The debate may be continuing about global warming, but the ground reality here is that dozens of streams and brooks of Kullu district have dried up completely, while many others are about to disappear.

Beyond that limit, they can lay claim to the rights to the seabed as far as the continental shelf extends from their territory.  In the case of those five countries, experts here estimate that their seabed rights together will encompass more than 90 per cent of the Arctic, leaving a small central portion as high seas open to others.  Norway has already won UN approval for its claim to Arctic seabed and has begun producing oil in some areas. Russiaâ€™s claim was rejected for lack of detailed documentation, but it is expected to return to the UN authority that manages the process with its claims this year or next.  The US is not a signatory to the Law of the Sea Convention, so must wait for everyone elseâ€™s claims to be adjudicated, a process that officials say could take 15 years.",,,3,Jun,2012,HDU,No byline,,New Delhi,Rising sea level threatens India's coastal areas,New Delhi: Kerala's tranquil stretches of emerald green backwaters and Mumbai are among several locales on the western and eastern coasts facing threat from the rising sea level due to climate change.,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/rising-sea-level-threatens-indias-coastal-areas/article3487837.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/rising-sea-level-threatens-indias-coastal-areas/article3487837.ece,IS,,IS,,,IND,IA2,IB1,IC1,,India's NATCOM,,ID2,,,IT1,SB,many states,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,repeat,3,Jun,2012,BS,PTI,,,Rising sea level threatens India's coastal areas,"""It is estimated that sea level rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches between 1990 and 2100 would result in saline coastal groundwater, endangering wetlands and inundating valuable land and coastal communities.

We intend to wrap up negotiations by the 19th.â€ù  The Conference on Sustainable Development is the 20-year followup to the Earth Summit where UN members made historic agreements to combat climate change, wildlife loss and desertification.  An expected turnout of 116 heads of state or government will cap a week-long gathering of as many as 50,000 activists, business executives and policymakers.  Progress on the so-called outcome document has been mired by discord, often pitching developing economies against rich ones.  â€œThere are lively discussions still going on,â€ù the US special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, said in a conference call with journalists. â€œThereâ€™s still a lot to be wrestled with.â€ù  Problems include a set of â€œSustainable Development Goalsâ€ù to succeed the UNâ€™s Millennium Development Goals, due to expire in 2015, how to encourage the green economy and mustering funds to promote sustainable development. Poorer countries are calling for 30 billion dollars a year.  But another area of friction is over how or whether to reaffirm the â€œRio Principlesâ€ù set down in the 1992 summit, which say countries have â€œcommon but differentiated responsibilities.â€ù  The phrase is designed to ensure that poor countries do not have to shoulder the same burden as rich countries in fixing Earthâ€™s environmental problems.  But Stern was scathing, saying the phrase belonged to an era when China and other countries that today are emerging giant economies were far poorer and less able to contribute.  â€œThe idea, the phrase, (if) taken to mean a firewall between developed and developing countries, is completely unacceptable to us,â€ù he said.  The summit is taking place against a backdrop of ever-worsening news on the environment and financial or fiscal crises in rich economies have slashed the political will for concessions.  â€œWe have essentially lost 20 years from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.

Nayan Sharma",,:,IS,,IS,,,IND,IA5,B10,,,,,,,,IT1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ndian Express: Climate change effects are likely to continue to cause intense flood and drought in Assam  The recent unprecedented floods, accompanied by the erosion of the Brahmaputra, has brought the influencing factors of flood and erosion processes in Assam into focus. First, recent research indicates the likely impact of climate change, with the temperature projected to increase in the Brahmaputra basin in coming decades. This may trigger melting of glaciers in the Himalayas.  Thus, parameters directly dependent on temperature, like potential evapotranspiration, are also assumed to be on the rise. This will have a severe impact on the hydrology of the Brahmaputra river basin. Annual precipitation is not projected to change significantly, but seasonal amounts are likely to trigger intense rainfall events. Different climate change indicators, like the length of the longest dry periods, indicate more frequent and prolonged droughts. Increases in the number of consecutive dry days and in the maximum five-day precipitation amount in the region of the Tibetan Plateau for the monsoon season, as well as large temperature trends, suggest that Assam is highly sensitive to future changes in climate. Climate change effects are, therefore, likely to cause intense floods and droughts in Assam.  Second, the increased sediment supply from watershed areas due to deforestation has exceeded the sediment-carrying capacity of the river network, resulting in continuous stream bed rise, intensification of braiding and bank erosion, culminating in significant loss of the discharge-carrying capacity of the river channels. Out of an annual runoff of 537.2 km3 for the Brahmaputra system, 429.76 km3 volume of water flows during the four monsoon months. Due to constant silt deposition of the main-stem Brahmaputra and its tributaries, the channel cross-sections over the years are becoming insufficient to safely carry the huge flow volume of 429.76 km3, and the excess water that the channel cannot carry spills the bank or breaches the old embankments by over-topping or heavy seepage. This results in widespread flooding.  Third, the annual specific yield of 3 cusec/ sq mile of the Brahmaputra is the highest in the world, while the average valley width is only about 40-50 km. The Brahmaputra itself occupies about 10 km. Thus, the spill of excess flow from the silted river channels inundates large areas in no time. Even the 4,000-plus wetlands in the Brahmaputra valley are degrading due to wanton encroachments and siltation and are not much use in flood absorption. From a technical standpoint, the only way to prevent flooding in such a scenario is by creating numerous flood detention storage reservoirs at suitable sites, so that the excess flow spilling from silted rivers is held back in the reservoirs till the monsoon is over.  Fourth, the loss of land due to stream bank erosion of the entire Brahmaputra river system is probably one of the highest in the world. These eroded bank materials, coupled with the huge sediment volume contributed by the catchment area of about 5,40,000 sq km, is much more than the sediment-carrying capacity of the Brahmaputra river channel. Notably, the annual sediment volume carried by the Brahmaputra is around 800 million tonnes, one of the highest in the world.  Considering the extent of the problem at hand, it would be naÃ¯ve to believe that a simplistic approach hinging on a single measure can make a dent. The solution has to be a well-considered package of measures based on strong scientific analyses and supported by prudent pilot studies. A massive soil conservation campaign is needed to effectively reduce the sediment volume of the Brahmaputra, along with the creation of flood detention reservoirs, river training for erosion control, land reclamation and channelling using the new RCC Jack Jetty Field system, which can be supplemented by corrective dredging operations on a selective basis.  Chinaâ€™s river management approach for the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers may be of interest. The technology of water and sediment regulating based on the integrated water and sediment management concept was adopted to manage the Yellow River. Further, extensive soil conservation efforts are being undertaken through use of terracing, strip farming, sediment retention dams, planting of trees and grass barriers.",no link,,29,Jul,2012,DC,No byline,,Chennai,Pioneering change,"CHENNAI: IFMR and IIT Madras have added another father to their cap.

This report aims to provide policy makers, academicians, researchers, civil society groups and others a snapshot of the climate missions as perceived by the experts in the country at this time. It is hoped that the outputs will inform the government so that appropriate mid-stream corrections may be made. The results of the study will also be useful to hone the country's strategic thinking in the long-term economic development for climate change.  The study is based on interviews conducted on a large number of experts, specific in domains to the climate missions. The report presents cross-cutting issues related to the design of the mission documents, identifies the tensions that run through them, and the key strengths, challenges and weaknesses of individual missions as evaluated by the experts.  Furthermore, detailed qualitative assessment cards have been produced for each mission using the following criteria: (1) Goals and targets, (2) Consistency with the principles set forth by the Prime Minister's Council, (3) Technology features, (4) Research & Development, (5) Institutional arrangements, (6) Financial instruments, (7) Collaborations and partnerships and (8) Potential barriers to implementation.   The findings are numerous and detailed and can be found at http://www.indiaclimatemissions.org/  A few examples are given below:  Examples of strengths include the commendable goal of setting up databases in the public domain in the National Water Mission and the National Mission on Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem; several innovative mechanisms in the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency; and the fact that the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has raised the ambition of solar energy for individual states and the country as a whole.   Examples of weaknesses include the fact that the national mission on sustainable agriculture ignores the challenges faced by poor and marginal farmers; demand management of water has not been prioritised in the design of the National Water Mission; and there is insufficient focus on off-grid potential in the National Solar Mission, which could have provided energy services directly to the poor and led to development benefits. Examples of challenges to successful implementation include the need for coordination among different ministries and the various institutional mechanisms within each; lack of capacity in several domains to implement the missions effectively; fragmented authority between the centre and states; and politicization and the absence of inter-disciplinary expertise in key positions. The eight assessment cards and the full report may be read and downloaded from the following site: www.indiaclimatemissions.org  Sujatha Byravan, lead author of the report said, ""Climate change is a problem that will be here with us for a very long time and these missions are India's initial attempts at setting climate policy.

REUTERS/Jeff Tuttle Food security experts working on a chapter in a U.N. overview of global warming due in 2014 said governments should take more account of how extremes of heat, droughts or floods could affect food supplies from seeds to consumersâ€™ plates.  â€œIt has not been properly recognized yet that we are dealing with a food system here. There is a whole chain that is also going to be affected by climate change,â€ù Professor Dr John Porter of the University of Copenhagen said.  â€œIt is more than just the fact that there are droughts in the United States that will reduce yields,â€ù he said. Like the other experts, he said was giving personal opinions, not those of the U.N. panel.  After harvest, floods could wash away roads or bridges, for instance, between fields and factories processing the crop. Or warehouses storing food could be damaged by more powerful storms. Such factors were likely to hit poor nations hardest.  â€œThere are reasons to expect more frequent (price) spikes, given that it will be more common to see conditions that are considered extreme,â€ù said David Lobell, an assistant professor at Stanford University in California.  GRAIN STORAGE Other factors could dampen rises, however, â€œincluding responses such as raising grain storage or changing trade policiesâ€ù. He said Stanford was trying to produce models of the likelihood of price spikes to understand the risks.     â€œItâ€™s a distributional problem - there is enough food in the world. But the distribution doesnâ€™t work,â€ù said Bruce McCarl, a professor at Texas A&M University. Climate extremes could aggravate food price swings, he said.  The worst drought in five decades in the United States has pushed up corn prices by more than 50 percent from late May to record highs above $8 a bushel. Hot, dry weather has also hit crops in southern Europe.  A U.N. report on climate extremes in March said it was â€œvirtually certainâ€ù that days with extreme heat would increase. Among other findings, it said it was likely that downpours would increase as a percentage of total rainfall.  Scientists are traditionally wary of linking individual extremes such as the U.S. drought to climate change - weather events from heatwaves to dust storms have happened throughout history.  But James Hansen, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, expressed â€œa high degree of confidenceâ€ù this month that the European heatwave of 2003, the Russian heatwave of 2010 and the Texas and Oklahoma droughts of 2011 were â€œa consequence of climate changeâ€ù because they were so extreme.  His conclusion was challenged as too definite, even by some experts who say risks of such events are rising with greenhouse gas emissions, led by China and the United States.  On the positive side for food output, a slight rise in temperatures is likely to help plant growth overall.  RISING TEMPERATURES But long-term net benefits are doubtful, especially because U.N. studies say rising greenhouse gas emissions are on track to push temperatures up by more than 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, set by 200 nations as a threshold for dangerous change.  Temperatures have already risen by almost 1 degree (1.6F). Nations such as Australia could lose out more than others benefit.  â€œIn Australia there are huge areas where you can grow wheat. If that goes, I donâ€™t think there are northern areas that can take up the huge production lost,â€ù said Kaija Hakala, of MTT Agrifood Research Finland.  With more frequent climate extremes, researchers said there would be hard choices with a projected rise in the world population to 9 billion people by 2050 from 7 billion now. They urged more research into drought- or flood-resistant crops.  â€œWe may be hitting a point where itâ€™s getting harder to get technological progressâ€ù in raising yields, McCarl said. Annual yield growth for U.S. corn had slowed to about 1.5 percent from stellar rates of about 3.5 percent in the early 1970s.  Porter said the world had so far escaped predictions that population growth would outstrip food production, most famously by English writer Thomas Malthus in 1798.  But he said the world now had triple goals of producing food for people, crops for biofuels and feed for animals, often raised for their meat. â€œIn my view we can have two out of those three and not all three,â€ù he said.  A shift towards more vegetarian diets would help, he said.",,,17,Aug,2012,TOI,Reporter,Saswati Mukherjee,Bangalore,CSE alleges US of ruining Indian domestic solar photo-voltaic manufacturing industry,"BANGALORE: The United States is allegedly using the climate 'fast start financing' to its pervert advantage for ruining the Indian domestic solar photo-voltaic (PV) manufacturing industry, if a statement made by the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is to be believed.

""Climate change is already happening; widespread physical changes include rapid warming of the southeast and increasing flow of the east Australia current,"" the report said. The report described southeast Australia as a 'global warming hotspot', with the contraction south and strengthening of southern hemisphere winds causing the eastern current to become more intense and also warmer, reports the Daily Mail. ""A range of species including plankton, fish and invertebrates are now found further south because of the enhanced transport of larvae and juveniles in the stronger current and the high rate of regional warming,"" it said. Sea snakes were declining and warmer beaches were changing turtle breeding habits and seabird and marine mammal feeding and mating, it added. In the past 30 years, coral reefs have experienced increasing thermal bleaching and it is projected to become more frequent and severe, ""leading to chronic degradation of most coral reefs by the middle to late parts of the century"", the report said.

Others accept that Earthâ€™s climate is changing, but discount a human cause. Still others, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, accept the idea of climate change, but maintain the science is inconclusive.  The science of climate change prediction is dependent in part on complex computer models that take into account multiple factors that influence Earthâ€™s climate, including the level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Many such models have forecast the globally averaged temperature will rise by 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) this century if greenhouse emissions continue at current levels.  Recent global temperature increases support these predictions. On Monday, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that September 2012 was tied for the warmest month on Earth in the modern record, and was the 331st consecutive month above the 20th century average.  MODELING MARTIAN SNOWS Hartmann, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said he and his team confirmed the earthly computer modelsâ€™ effectiveness by using them to forecast conditions on Mars.  New satellite observations of glaciers, ice flows and other features on the red planet showed that the modelsâ€™ predictions corresponded with what was on the Martian surface, Hartmann said in a telephone interview.  One key difference between Earth and Mars is their tilt, he said. Earthâ€™s axis is fixed, with very small variations, at 23.5 degrees, held steady by the gravitational pull of our moon. This tilt is responsible for changing seasons as Earth moves through the year, alternately tipping its northern and southern hemispheres toward the sun.  Mars lacks a big moon to stabilize its tilt, and its rotational axis can vary as much as 70 degrees toward the sun. When that happens, polar ice evaporates and puts moisture into the Martian atmosphere, which dumps snow, ice and ultimately glaciers in Marsâ€™ mid-latitudes. The last time this happened, astronomers say, was between 5 million and 20 million years ago.  Factoring in the planetâ€™s varying tilt, topography, atmosphere and other information, the climate models forecast specific regions for massive snowfalls, and the remnants of those snowfalls are right there, Hartmann said. So are ice flows and other features, viewed by NASAâ€™s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  â€œWe do have a lot of public figures, in our country particularly, saying that the global climate modeling studies have very little value,â€ù Hartmann said. â€œIf the global climate modeling people can run these models on Mars and we actually see things that come out of the model on another planet, then the climate modeling people must be doing something right.â€ù",,,18,Oct,2012,TOI,No byline,,Hyderabad,Rich nations refuse to commit money to conserve biodiversity,"HYDERABAD: A day after PM Manmohan Singh kick-started the 'Hyderabad Pledge' by announcing $50 million for biodiversity conservation, the developed countries remained reluctant to commit money under the Convention on Biodiversity at the ongoing meeting.

They simply do not know for sure if the storm was caused or made worse by human-induced global warming.  They do know, however, that the resulting storm surge along the Atlantic coast was almost certainly intensified by decades of sea-level rise linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases.  And they emphasized that hurricane Sandy, whatever its causes, should be seen as a foretaste of trouble to come as the seas rise faster, the risks of climate change accumulate and the political system fails to respond.  â€œWeâ€™re changing the environment â€” itâ€™s very clear,â€ù said Thomas R Knutson, a research meteorologist with the governmentâ€™s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.  By the time hurricane Sandy hit the Northeast coast on Monday, it had become a freakish hybrid of a large, late-season hurricane and a winter storm more typical of the middle latitudes. Though by no means unprecedented, that type of hybrid storm is rare enough that scientists have not studied whether it is likely to become more common in a warming climate.  â€œMy profession hasnâ€™t done its homework,â€ù said Kerry A Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. â€œI think thereâ€™s going to be a tonne of papers that come out of this, but itâ€™s going to take a couple of years.â€ù  Hurricanes draw their energy from warm waters in the top layer of the ocean. And scientists pointed out this week that parts of the western Atlantic were remarkably warm for late October.  Kevin E Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said that natural variability probably accounted for most of that temperature extreme.  But, he added, human-induced global warming has raised the overall temperature of the ocean surface by about one degree Fahrenheit since the 1970s. So global warming probably contributed a notable fraction of the energy on which the storm thrived â€” maybe as much as 10%, he said.  He further said that many of Sandyâ€™s odd features, including its large scale, derived from its origin as a merger of two weather systems that converged in the western Atlantic. â€œMy view is that a lot of this is chance.â€ù  Globally, the ocean rose about eight inches in the last century, and the rate seems to have accelerated to about a foot and scientists say most of the rise is a direct consequence of human-induced climate change.

But it is also trying to curb emissions growth in a unique way, fearing the impacts of climate change and spiralling energy costs.  The government is betting big on two market-based trading schemes to encourage energy efficiency and green power across the country of 1.2 billion people, sidestepping emissions trading schemes that have poisoned political debate in the United States and Australia.  â€œThe policy roadmap India is adopting to curb emissions is innovative -- something that will make industries look at making efficiency the center-piece rather than some step that follows an ineffective carrot and stick policy,â€ù said Srinivas Krishnaswamy, CEO of green policy consultants Vasudha India.  In the worldâ€™s first such national market-based mechanism, called Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT), India is starting a mandatory scheme that sets benchmark efficiency levels for 563 big polluting from power plants to steel mills and cement plants, that account for 54 percent of the countryâ€™s energy consumption.  The scheme allows businesses using more energy than stipulated to buy tradeable energy saving certificates, or Escerts, from those using less energy, creating a market estimated by the government to be worth about $16 billion in 2014 when trading starts.  The number of Escerts depends on the amount of energy saved in a target year.  LEARNING CURVE A three-year rollout phase is set to start in September and will help India curb about 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions, the government estimates.  The rollout is aimed at working out hiccups in the process for companies to measure and report their energy use.  India has already rolled out a renewable energy certificate (REC) trading scheme for wind, solar and biomass power plants. Green power comprises about 8 percent of energy production in India, while coal generates more than 60 percent, leading to a hefty coal import bill.  Trading for the REC scheme, which currently occurs once a month, has picked up as more projects participate, underpinning a government plan to ramp up solar power from near zero to 20 gigawatts by 2022, about one eighth of power generation now.  On May 25, a total of 14,002 RECs were traded during the REC trading session on the Indian Energy Exchange valued at $4.6 million, compared with 260 units at the previous session in April.  But concerns remain about how both initiatives will evolve because of a lack of data and trained manpower as well as weak penalties for firms that refuse to comply.  â€œIndia has an issue of manpower and data. You look at incomes, industrial activities are growing, the share market might boom but hiring manpower, (building up) capacity and institutions is a long-term game,â€ù said Girish Sant, energy analyst at non-profit think tank Prayas.  Some analysts also point to technical gaps in the PAT scheme, including how various units of one company would be graded. There were also limitations that allow REC certificates to be traded only once, limiting the early entry of intermediaries or market makers.  â€œIn order to have an effective cap-and-trade or market mechanism that aids desired reduction in energy use, it is necessary to have targets that are neither too easy nor too difficult to achieve,â€ù said leading Indian clean energy project developer and advisory Emergent Ventures in a report on PAT.  But industry observers said it still makes sense for India to opt for a national energy efficiency scheme rather than carbon emissions trading.  â€œBecause the target is intensity, so you are basically asking people to reduce their intensity and that matches the overall target,â€ù said Sant of Prayas.  The government has pledged to cut carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output -- by between 20 and 25 percent by 2020, from 2005 levels.  Emissions trading would need an absolute emissions cap, something India does not want to do, saying it needs to keep its economy growing and competitive.  Adapting to the national policy and creating a unique market are a function of time and communication, said Vishwajit Dahanukar, managing director of Managing Emissions, a clean energy project developer, advisory and asset manager.  â€œThatâ€™s basically it. Itâ€™s just early days,â€ù he told Reuters from Mumbai.  Rival China is also looking at promoting energy efficiency but most of the governmentâ€™s planned efforts focus more on carbon emissions trading to achieve national climate and pollution goals.  In April, a senior Chinese official said the government would launch pilot emissions trading schemes in six provinces before 2013 and set up a nationwide trading platform by 2015, Thomson Reuters Point Carbon reported. The programme would be based on provincial-level energy consumption targets.  The Chinese government is also considering a cap-and-trade scheme for energy savings in its buildings sector, which accounts for 30 to 40 percent of the countryâ€™s overall emissions.  According to a government directive, the mechanism would create energy saving credits but the programme was still in the early planning stages, with trading some years away.  â€œAs Chinese industry is much more organised and the political system allows stringent monitoring, it becomes a little easier for them to use emissions trading,â€ù said Siddharth Pathak, Greenpeace Indiaâ€™s policy officer for climate and energy, told Reuters.  â€œAlso the push back from Indian industry would be much more than China.â€ù",,,29,May,2011,FE,Reporter,Rajeev Tikoo,,"Industry needs to think long-term, not just of immediate bottom line","Jyoti K Parikh is executive director of Integrated Research and Action for Development (IRADe), an institute focusing on energy and climate change, and member of the Prime Ministerâ€™s Council on Climate Change.

Bloomberg have circled each other warily for a decade, ever since Mr. Clinton landed in Harlem after leaving the White House and Mr. Bloomberg ascended from a hugely successful business career to become the mayor of New York City. They have appeared together at a few civic functions, dined out a couple of times a year and hacked at golf balls on the same course.  But until now they have never joined forces on a project with global reach that could advance both of their legacies. They are taking on an issue â€” climate change â€” that may well shape the worldâ€™s economic and social future for decades to come.  Mr. Bloombergâ€™s billions of dollars and Mr. Clintonâ€™s billions of friends are a potent combination, but can this unlikely power coupling make an impact in stemming rising seas or cooling the planet?  â€œThis is enough to choke a horse, one of the two or three biggest challenges in the world,â€ù Mr. Clinton said in an unusual joint telephone interview last week with Mr. Bloomberg. â€œBut if we can prove that this is good economics, good public health and fights the most calamitous consequences of climate change, then we will have done a world of good.â€ù  Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg are men of considerable accomplishment and healthy self-regard. So, naturally, questions arose last month when they announced the merging of their climate-change initiatives into a single global effort focused on the worldâ€™s largest cities.  Continue reading the main story ADVERTISEMENT  Continue reading the main story  Who will be in charge and how will they share a stage, beginning this week when they appear together at a climate conference in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil?  â€œI have always thought that we should have a relationship based alphabetically on our last names,â€ù Mr. Bloomberg said.  â€œI have a partnership with George W. Bush on Haiti, and I had a partnership with his dad on Katrina,â€ù Mr. Clinton said. â€œSo you know, I donâ€™t care who gets the credit.â€ù  It was six years ago when Mr. Clinton, working with Ken Livingstone, the leftist and then-mayor of London, drew together officials from 40 of the worldâ€™s largest cities, from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Yokohama, Japan, to share ideas for reducing carbon emissions and dealing with the inevitable impacts of a changing climate. The effort was ambitious but chronically underfinanced, with an annual budget of less than $500,000.  The group met periodically to discuss climate mitigation efforts like switching to LED streetlights, retrofitting public buildings and generating energy from landfills. The William J. Clinton Foundation provided technical assistance and financing for discrete projects, but the group of cities, known as the C40, lacked a steady financing stream, a database of emissions and mitigation programs, and a professional staff.  Enter Mr. Bloomberg, who campaigned for and won the chairmanship of the group last year. He pledged $6 million a year of his foundation money for each of the next three years to bolster the C40 and essentially muscled aside the Clinton staff members working on the project. Mr. Clinton, never one to reject a gift horse, happily acceded.  â€œI really donâ€™t care how you characterize it,â€ù Mr. Clinton said. â€œThe fact that he made a multiyear commitment coincident with his leadership means that we will be able to go in and help cities who are in trouble financially and canâ€™t do these projects.â€ù  ADVERTISEMENT  Continue reading the main story  An adviser to Mr. Clinton, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to elaborate more candidly on Mr. Clintonâ€™s remark, was a bit less diplomatic about Mr. Bloombergâ€™s approach. â€œHe came to us,â€ù the adviser said. â€œWhat are we going to do, fight him?

Congress has made it clear that it is not going to enact a national program to address global warming any time soon and the 194-nation United Nations process has made little progress toward a binding international treaty.  Donors who have provided financing for climate programs are frustrated and fatigued, and many advocacy groups are turning their attention to issues on which they can have tangible impact. Organizations are consolidating and learning to make do with less.  Mr. Bloomberg refers to this as a â€œmaturingâ€ù approach to activist philanthropy. â€œItâ€™s not so much people getting bored with the whole thing or walking away,â€ù he said. â€œItâ€™s that if youâ€™re going to live through the tough times, this type of efficiency makes sense.â€ù  Mr. Bloomberg hired Jay Carson, a former assistant to Mr. Clinton and campaign adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, to serve as chief executive of the C40. Mr. Carson said that what set the C40 apart from other climate advocacy groups was that the mayors had actual power to affect emissions and energy use, although it varied from city to city. This weekâ€™s C40 climate meeting is expected to reinvigorate the group and set its members on a path toward consistent and measurable reductions in carbon emissions.  They are expected to announce a new formal partnership with the World Bank, which will eventually provide financial and technical assistance for cities seeking to reduce emissions by improving energy efficiency in transit, power generation, lighting and public buildings.  Cities now house more than half of the worldâ€™s population, and while they occupy 2 percent of the globeâ€™s land mass, cities consume 70 percent of global energy and produce 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. If anything meaningful is going to happen on climate in the short term, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bloomberg and their advisers say, it has to start in the cities.  â€œWe are putting a stake in the ground around the idea that national and international governments have failed, possibly quite permanently, or at least in a way that they will not make any serious progress before itâ€™s too late,â€ù said Kevin Sheekey, a former deputy mayor of New York and principal political adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. â€œIf you address the problems of the cities, there will be no need for China and India to sign onto some international accord. And thank God, because thatâ€™s not going to get done. Itâ€™s time to say it.â€ù  Mr. Sheekey added, â€œThis is much more than a few green roofs, but really cataloging the damage weâ€™re doing to the climate in hard numbers and coming up with realistic plans and financing measures to mitigate it.â€ù  ADVERTISEMENT  Continue reading the main story  While Mr. Clinton and Al Gore, who served as his vice president, worked together on climate issues in the White House, they have taken separate paths on the issue since. Mr. Gore focuses on raising awareness and stimulating grass-roots activism, while Mr. Clinton has devoted his time to on-the-ground solutions like retrofitting buildings with energy efficient windows and heating systems.  Mr. Bloomberg shrugged off a question about whether he sees climate change as an issue on which he will be judged long after he leaves office, in 2014. His focus is much shorter term, he said.  â€œIâ€™m expecting weâ€™ll have a few drinks and a lot of laughs in SÃ£o Paulo,â€ù he said. â€œI hope we can make a difference.â€ù",changed,Extra,30,May,2011,IE,bloomberg,,,Climate change to hit global food output: UN,"Global food output may be hurt as climate change brings more extreme weather over the next decade, with China likely set for harsher droughts and North America getting heavier rain, said the World Meteorological Organization.",http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/climate-change-to-hit-global-food-output-un/,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/climate-change-to-hit-global-food-output-un/,GS,,GS,,,GLO,A6,B10,C2,,"WMO, FAO, UN",,D4,D5,D6,T1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no link,Extra,30,May,2011,TOI,AFP,,washington,"Climate change to deal blow to fruits, nuts: Study","Climate change is expected to alter the global industry in fruits and nuts dramatically as tree crops such as pistachios and cherries struggle in the rising temperatures, researchers said.",http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-29/global-warming/29596426_1_climate-change-fruits-nuts,http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-29/global-warming/29596426_1_climate-change-fruits-nuts,GS,,GS,,,GLO,A1,B4,C6,,World Agroforestry Center,,D5,,,TI,,,,,,,,Adpt,,,,IPCC,,,"""Climate change to deal blow to fruits, nuts: study WASHINGTON: Climate change is expected to alter the global industry in fruits and nuts dramatically as tree crops such as pistachios and cherries struggle in the rising temperatures, researchers said.

Rising temperatures pose a special problem for temperate but comparatively warm areas where the winter chill is already in short supply. The study, published in May by the online journal PLoS One, expected fruit and nut trees to be highly affected in California, the southeastern United States, Chinaâ€™s Yunnan province and southern and southwestern Australia.  Areas that have already seen the worst losses of winter chill include Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and the Cape region of South Africa, the study said.  Common fruits and nuts in the warmer temperate areas include pistachios, which are popular in Iran and California, along with walnuts, cherries and peaches.  Co-author Eike Luedeling of the Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Center said that farmers making long-term investments needed to realize quickly that fruits and nuts are more vulnerable than many other crops.  """"If Iâ€™m growing wheat or maize, then from one year to the next I can decide whether to plant a little late or plant a little earlier or plant a different variety,"""" Luedeling said.  """"But for trees, you canâ€™t. Once youâ€™ve made a decision to plant a certain crop, youâ€™re locked in for 30 years,"""" he said.  Luedeling, who observed the problem of declining yields while researching trees in Oman, said that the economic impact of climate change to fruits and nuts would depend on decisions being made now.     """"If farmers wake up to the reality of climate change and start making these adjustments â€” switching to cultivars that are appropriate in the future, but not necessarily now yet â€”then the disruption to markets could be minimal,"""" he said.  """"But if we donâ€™t, if farmers believe they can keep doing what their grandfathers have done, then we will see some serious problems,"""" he said.  Climate change is forecast to have less impact on cooler temperate regions and the winter chill may actually increase in some colder regions, the study found.  Co-author Evan Girvetz, a senior climate scientist at The Nature Conservancy, a US environmental group, said cooler regions had a greater window for rising temperatures as they started out with more days of winter chill.  But many warmer areas are """"already on that edge of not having enough cold temperatures during the winter for good fruit and nut production,"""" Girvetz said.  """"They have years when you donâ€™t have enough full production and as we move into the future, we are finding that thatâ€™s going to become more common,"""" he said.  Even if the world cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions, """"we are still projecting that the suitability for growing these crops is likely to decrease,"""" he said.  The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in a major report in 2007 forecast that the world would heat up by 1.8 to 4.0 degrees Celsius (3.2-7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 compared with pre-industrial levels and that some damage was irreversible.  However, political momentum to fight climate change has since declined, especially in the United States, with a number of conservative lawmakers raising doubts about the science and saying that action is too costly.""",,,2,Jun,2011,ET,PTI,,New Delhi,Greenpeace protests against Airtel's silence on CO2 emissions,"Global environment NGO Greenpeace today staged a protest against telco Bharti Airtel for not disclosing the measures taken by the company to lower its carbon emissions, including the shift towards renewable sources of energy to power its network operations.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/greenpeace-protests-against-airtels-silence-on-co2-emissions/articleshow/8683598.cms,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/telecom/greenpeace-protests-against-airtels-silence-on-co2-emissions/articleshow/8683598.cms,PBZ,,BZ,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC4,IC5,GREENPEACE DEMO AGAINST AIRTEL,,ID3,ID3,,IT8,,,,,,,,Mit,,,,,,,,,,2,Jun,2011,HDU,No byline,,Bangalore,"It will be warmer by 2030, says climate change report","The Karnataka Climate Change Action Plan (KCCAP) â€” a comprehensive report on the impact of change on the climate of the State, prepared by Bangalore Climate Change Initiative-Karnataka (BCCI-K) states that failure to protect the environment will impact forest area to the extent of 38 per cent by 2030 and most areas in the State will experience rise in temperature from 1.8 to 2.2 degrees Celsius.",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/it-will-be-warmer-by-2030-says-climate-change-report/article2069681.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/it-will-be-warmer-by-2030-says-climate-change-report/article2069681.ece,IPL,IS,IP,IS,,IND,IA2,IB1,IC6,IC3,BCCI-K SAPCC submitted to state govt,,ID5,,,IT6,SB,Karnataka,,,,,,,,"SAPCC, NAPCC",,,,,,Changed,,3,Jun,2011,HT,No byline,,,Carbon credit mkt tanking: World Bank,"The international market in carbon credits has suffered an almost total collapse, with only $ 1.5billion of them traded last year â€” the lowest since the system opened in 2005, according to a report from the World Bank.

The plan is weighing the ruling center-left Labor Party down in disastrous opinion polling because of fears about how it will affect costs, particularly electricity costs.  Key issues including the tax rate and how compensation will be distributed to help industry and households make the transition to a lower-carbon economy are still being negotiated with the minor Greens party and independent lawmakers whose support is crucial to the plan becoming law.   ""Petrol prices will not be touched by carbon pricing,"" Gillard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television. ""The design of this scheme is that petrol will be out now and out for the future.""  Her promise will anger the Greens party, which wants the tax applied across the entire economy.  Gillard credited rural independent lawmaker Tony Windsor with swaying her to exclude gasoline. Gillard relies on Windsor's support to maintain a fragile single-seat majority in the House of Representatives.  ""He has put forward a powerful case for people in country Australia who have got no choice but to jump in their cars and get places,"" she said, referring to a lack of public transport outside big cities.  The Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in a statement the gasoline exemption would will simply shift the price burden of reducing the nation's emissions to other areas of the economy. The government has promised to slash Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to at least 5 percent below 2000 levels. Australia is one of the world's worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita, largely because it relies heavily on abundant reserves of cheap coal for electricity.  Conservative opposition leader Tony Abbott opposes polluters being forced to pay anything for the carbon gas that they create. His stance has helped his coalition lead in recent opinion polls.  Labor is hoping that public hostility toward the tax will have subsided before Australia's next elections are due in 2013. - AP   Read more at https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2011/07/04/pm-excludes-gasoline-from-aussie-carbon-tax-plan/#bpyleIJ9wfqomkjg.99",,extra,3,Jul,2011,TEL,No byline,,Jorhat,"In step with climate change- Gardens mull rainwater harvesting, seek expert help","Tea gardens in Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Jorhat districts may soon turn to rainwater harvesting in response to change in climate and have sought help from IIT Guwahati.",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110704/jsp/northeast/story_14188844.jsp,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110704/jsp/northeast/story_14188844.jsp,IPL,IS,IP,IS,,IND,IA2,IB5,IC5,IC6,North Eastern Tea Association AND ITT K,,ID6,,,IT1,SB,Assam,,,,,,Adpt,,,,,,,,NO LINK,,17,Jul,2011,ET,IANS,,Shimla,"Himachal's afforestation plan, Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development Project for carbon trading scheme, gets UN nod","IANS : India's first multi-million public afforestation scheme in Himachal Pradesh has been registered for carbon trading by the UN, an official statement said here on Sunday.",http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/himachals-afforestation-plan-mid-himalayan-watershed-development-project-for-carbon-trading-scheme-gets-un-nod/articleshow/9260534.cms,http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/himachals-afforestation-plan-mid-himalayan-watershed-development-project-for-carbon-trading-scheme-gets-un-nod/articleshow/9260534.cms,ICM,,IP,,,IND,IA1,B1,C3,C2,WB supported CDM for HP,,D4,,,IT4,SB,Himachal Pradesh,,,,,,MIT,,,,,,,"Shimla, July 17 (IANS) India's first multi-million public afforestation scheme in Himachal Pradesh has been registered for carbon trading by the UN, an official statement said here Sunday.

Kapoor, said. Carbon credits provide a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by giving them a monetary value. A credit gives the owner the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide. Credits can be exchanged between businesses or purchased and sold in the international market at current market prices. Under the carbon trading scheme, 5,000 families settled in villages would receive carbon revenue for the next 20 years from the World Bank for providing green cover to 4,000 hectares of barren land in 10 districts of the state. 'The project is estimated to generate carbon revenue of at least Rs.20 crore to the communities and individual land holders for the first 20 years, which is an incentive to protect forest cover. The first payment is likely to be disbursed to the stakeholders in the next two years,' Kapoor added.

While the polls were disastrous, Gillard at least won support Monday from the country's largest union for her plan to price carbon.  The Australian Workers' Union said it believed the government had developed a package that ensured jobs would not be lost.  â€œWe said quite rightly and quite proudly that our union would not support a price on carbon that costs the jobs of our members.

UK companies such as Ineos are worried they will be put at a competitive disadvantage. The UK government is planning to introduce the carbon price floor at 16 pounds ($25.09) a tonne from April 1, 2013, rising each year to 30 pounds a tonne in 2020. But Tom Crotty, group director of Ineos, said this potentially â€œsticks the UK out on a limbâ€ù relative to the rest of Europe. â€œThe problem is that energy-intensive users in the UK may get hit quite hard relative to other countries if that carbon price differential opens up.â€ù Ineos said its ChlorVinyls business faces increased costs of 5 million pounds per annum, rising to a potential 30 million per year by 2020, whilst its Grangemouth businesses face costs of between 26 million and 61 million pounds over the same period. The UK plans are part of broader moves by the EU, which is proposing refiners be required to pay for their carbon emissions credits from January 1, 2013, in an effort to cut emissions and encourage investment in cleaner alternatives. In the first two phases of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), refineries were given free allocations. But industry concerns are growing that EU refiners, many aging and already suffering from low margins, will be unable to compete with products imported from newer, more complex refineries such as Relianceâ€™s Jamnagar in India if the EUâ€™s ETS steps up as envisaged. Isabelle Muller, secretary general of the European Petroleum Industry Association (Europia), said that instead of changing consumer behaviors, â€œthe EU legislator is attacking production, but production is mobile.â€ù Europiaâ€™s members account for more than 80 percent of EU refining capacity.",,extra,3,Oct,2011,DH,No byline,,Bangalore,Cities are the major polluters',They consume 75 per cent of energy and emit 80 per cent of greenhouse gases.

Itâ€™s based on a review of other studies and found that 38 of 85 animal and plant species showed a documented reduction in size over decades, including a type of Scottish sheep that is 5 per cent smaller than in 1985. Those studies looked at species over different time periods and in varying numbers.  The shrinking victims, according to the study, include cotton, corn, strawberries, bay scallops, shrimp, crayfish, carp, Atlantic salmon, herring, frogs, toads, iguanas, hooded robins, red-billed gulls, California squirrels, lynx and wood rats.  Two years ago, Scottish researchers made news with the shrinking sheep study. Several studies have shown that polar bears, which rely on sea ice during the summer, also are not as big. And this latest study said the house sparrowâ€™s weight has dropped by one-seventh from 1950 to 1990. A bird called the graceful warbler showed a 26 per cent weight drop during the same time period.  â€œThere is a trend in a number of organisms across the board from plants to big vertebrates getting smaller,â€ù said study co-author Jennifer Sheridan, a biology researcher at the University of Alabama. â€œThe theory is as things get warmer they donâ€™t need to grow as large.â€ù  Most of these animals are cold-blooded, so the warmer the weather the faster their metabolism is and the more calories they burn, Sheridan said. Thereâ€™s a biological law, called Bergmannâ€™s rule that says that as it gets colder, animals get bigger.  This is the unwritten flip side of it, she said. But Yoram Yom-Tov, a zoologist at Tel Aviv University whose studies Sheridan used in her research, said many species are shrinking, and you canâ€™t blame global warming exclusively.  â€œChanges in body size are a normal phenomenon,â€ù Yom-Tov wrote in an email. â€œWhen conditions are favourable, they increase in size or reproduce at higher rates, and when conditions are deteriorating, they do the opposite. I think that most species will adapt to climate change and survive. No need for alarm.â€ù And Stanford biologist Terry Root, an expert in climate change, said the studyâ€™s conclusions â€œseem kind of far-fetched.â€ù",,,17,Oct,2011,,Reporter,Noor Mohammad,New Delhi,"Oz carbon tax law turns heat on Indian power, steel cos","In what spells tough times for Indian power and steel companies using Australian coal, the lower house of that countryâ€™s Parliament has passed a politically contentious Bill to impose carbon tax on polluting industries.",http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Oz-carbon-tax-law-turns-heat-on-Indian-powersteel-cos/860769/,http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Oz-carbon-tax-law-turns-heat-on-Indian-powersteel-cos/860769/,BBZ,TRC,BZ,,,ACDC,IA2,IB8,IC5,C1,AUS CARBON TAX ON Indian Cos,,ID6,,,IT1,,,BP,TIN,,,,mit,,,,,,,,,extra,17,Oct,2011,BS,No byline,,Chennai/ Hyderabad,Subsidy on solar and clean energy sought,The Engineering Staff College of India (ESCI) has urged the central government to provide subsidy on solar and clean energy.,http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/subsidysolarclean-energy-sought/452745/,http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/subsidysolarclean-energy-sought/452745/,IPL,,IP,,,IND,IA2,IB1,IC6,,,,ID5,,,IT6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28,Oct,2011,BS,Opinion,Uday Abhyankar,,Climate change talks - Dilemma in Durban,"Uday Abhyankar: Climate change negotiations are with us again, this time in Durban following the high-level meetings in Cancun (2010) and Copenhagen (2009).

But India, China and Brazil were united in opposing such a proposition noting that the developed world was yet to deliver on existing commitments and was asking for more flexibility from the BASIC group without any returns. India's restored position against uneven compromises at the UN talks was echoed by Brazil and China, ensuring that the formal BASIC statement did not refer to the issue. Natarajan won support for the inclusion of equity, IPR and trade issues on climate agenda for Durban from not only the three BASIC countries but also Argentina heading the G77 grouping, Grenada on behalf of small island states and Egypt representing Arab countries. The three were present as observers at the Beijing meeting. The four BASIC countries stated in a joint statement, ""Ministers underlined the importance of the Indian proposal to include the issues of equity, trade and intellectual property... they agreed that discussions on these important issues, which are crucial to many developing countries, would contribute to comprehensive and balanced outcome at Durban."" At the ministerial level talks held recently at Pretoria, South Africa had pushed more strongly for formally starting talks on a new deal but at Beijing, it was hemmed in by the unanimity shown by other three BASIC countries. At Pretoria, it had faced opposition to the proposal, which was initially fathered by the EU, from not just the three BASIC countries but also from the US, UAE, Indonesia and South Korea. At the two-day BASIC meeting in Beijing, the four countries upped the stakes on Kyoto Protocol with a warning that they would not support carbon trading with those developed countries which did not commit to targets under the second phase of Kyoto Protocol. Carbon trading allows the developed countries to find cheaper avenues of reducing greenhouse gases, instead of undertaking mitigation actions at a higher cost in their backyard. Also choking off any attempt by developed countries to use an impending review of achievements under the treaty to rewrite the UN climate convention, the four also took a common position that the appraisal should include assessment of the adequacy of global temperature goal, the sufficiency of targets of the rich countries and their financial and technological support to the developing world.",,,2,Nov,2011,HDU,Reporter,Ananth Krishnan,Beijing,BASIC countries show united front ahead of Durban meet,"India, China, Brazil and South Africa â€“ the BASIC group of developing countries â€“ on Tuesday sought to bridge their differences and strike a common position ahead of this monthâ€™s climate change conference in Durban, calling on the West to ensure the extension of the Kyoto Protocol as well as step up financial and technological assistance to developing countries.",http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/basic-countries-show-united-front-ahead-of-durban-meet/article2589530.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/basic-countries-show-united-front-ahead-of-durban-meet/article2589530.ece,GPT,,GP,,,ACDC,IA2,B3,C2,C1,BASIC meeting,,D2,ID2,,T2,,,BP,UNFCCC,FIN,CBDR RC,,Mit,,,,,COP,BASIC MEET IN BEIJING,,No link,,3,Nov,2011,HT,Agencies,,,Help India go green,"India will engage 100,000 educated youths to execute an ambitious Green India Mission (GIM) which seeks to increase the countryâ€™s forest cover to 33% from 20% within 10 years.",,:,IPL,,IP,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC1,,GIM,,ID2,,,IT4,,,,,,,,,,NAPCC,,,,,"India will engage 100,000 educated youths to execute an ambitious Green India Mission (GIM) which seeks to increase the countryâ€™s forest cover to 33% from 20% within 10 years.  According to top forest official, PJ Dilip Kumar, director general of Indiaâ€™s forest department, in order to cope with climate change threats, the central and state governments have decided to raise new forest cover on five million hectares under the GIM.  â€œIndia has to increase its present forest cover area of 20% (out of the total geographical area) to 33% within the next 10 years,â€ù Kumar said in a recent interview. â€œTo facilitate planning, execution and monitoring of the GIM at the village level, one lakh cadre of community foresters (CCF) would be employed from among educated community youths,â€ù he said.  The R46,000 crore ($9 billion) plan is one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change announced by the prime minister in June 2008.

He told scientists at Thiruvananthapuram: ""There is no escaping the truth that the nations of the world have to move to a low greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficient development path.""  The Copenhagen Accord sets the goal of limiting global temperature increases to 2 degree celsius though it does not set any binding targets for emission reduction. Both developing and developed countries will have to inform UNFCCC of its commitment to reduce emission of greenhouse gases to mitigate the effects of climate change. The accord pledges $30 billion between 2010 and 2012 and $100 billion by 2020 for developing countries, particularly vulnerable countries and small island states, to help adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change.  The Copenhagen Accord could not be adopted due to objection by several countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Sudan. As a compromise measure, the Accord was ""taken note of"".  In this context, the prime minister called on scientists to ""do much more"" as the scientific capability will determine India's ability to face the new challenges like climate change. ""We face new challenges of climate change and the management of our scarce water resources. We also face old challenges of food security and disease control. In all these areas, our success will depend critically on the quality of our institutions of science and technology.""   Mr Singh said India must not lag behind in efforts to achieve greater energy efficiency, shifting to renewable sources of energy and chalking out strategies for adapting to climate change. ""India must not lag behind in these areas. Indeed we should plan to be among the leaders in the development of science and technology related to mitigation and also adaptation to climate change. The market for such technologies is not just India. It is indeed the whole world.""  As far as India's energy basket was concerned, Mr Singh said renewable and clean energy supplies will need to play a much bigger role than at present.

REUTERS/Mick Tsikas  The scientists said their monitoring and research of the worldâ€™s driest inhabited continent for 100 years â€œclearly demonstrate that climate change is real.â€ù  â€œWe are seeing significant evidence of a changing climate. We are warming in every part of the country during every season and as each decade goes by, the records are being broken,â€ù said Megan Clark, head of Australiaâ€™s state-backed Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).  The U.N.â€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged in January its 2007 report had exaggerated the pace of Himalayan glaciers melting, and last month said the report also had overstated how much of the Netherlands is below sea level.  The 2007 report is based on the work of thousands of scientists and is the main policy guide for governments looking to act on climate change. Skeptics have leapt on the errors, saying they undermine the science of climate change but the IPCC, which has announced a review, has defended its work.  The CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology report said international research showed it is extremely unlikely that global warming could be explained by natural causes alone.   â€œThere is greater than 90 percent certainty that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have caused most of the global warming since the mid-20th century,â€ù said the report.  â€œEvidence of human influence has been detected in ocean warming, sea-level rise, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns,â€ù said the report.  Australia, a major grains and meat producer, battled the worst drought in 100 years for most of the past decade, damaging its farm output, but in recent years the commodities sector has been recovering due to good rainfall.  The government estimated farm output for 2008/09 at A$42 billion ($38.4 billion) out of total Australian gross domestic product of A$1.2 trillion.  Studies show that rising seas, shifting rainfall patterns and greater extremes of droughts and floods could cost Australiaâ€™s economy dearly. A government report last November said residential buildings worth up to A$63 billion could be inundated if seas rise by 1.1 meters (3.5 feet) this century.  HEATING UP Since 1960, the mean temperature in Australia has increased by about 0.7 degrees Celsius, but some areas of the country had warmed by 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius in the past 50 years, the report said.  Australiaâ€™s warmest decade on record is 2000 to 2009.  While total rainfall in Australia had been relatively stable, the geographic distribution changed significantly over the past 50 years, with rainfall decreasing in southwest and southeast Australia, the major population areas.  Sea levels around the island continent since 1993 have risen 7-10mm per year in the north and west and 1.5 to 3mm in the south and east, said the report. From 1870 to 2007, the global average sea level rose by close to 200mm (8 inches), sea levels rose at an average of 1.7mm a year in the 20th century and about 3mm per year from 1993-2009, it said.  Sea surface temperatures around Australia have increased by about 0.4 degrees Celsius in the past 50 years.  The scientists said global carbon dioxide concentration in 2009 of 386 parts per million (ppm) was much higher than the natural range of 170 to 300 ppm that existed in the atmosphere for the past 800,000 years and possibly 20 million years.  The scientists said that based on their monitoring of the nationâ€™s climate for 100 years, Australian average temperatures are projected to rise by 0.6 to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030.",no

commissioned by the European Green lawmakers.   A report from environmental consultancy CE Delft says the EU could easily increase its target to cut carbon dioxide emissions from 20 percent by 2020 to at least 30 percent and that it should be aiming for 40 percent to hold back global warming.   Sharp falls in manufacturing and power consumption caused by the economic downturn will account for about a third of the EU's planned reduction, it said.   ``The economic crisis will already do the job,'' Sander de Bruyn, one of the CE Delft researchers said. ``We should now adopt the minus 30 percent goal.''  The report says the European Union isn't doing as much as it likes to claim because companies and governments plan to make up another third of the reduction target by buying carbon offsets that cancel their emissions by paying for environmental programs in developing nations.   It also said the EU should go further than other regions because it has done more to cause global warming for longer, since the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.   A panel of UN scientists has recommended that developed countries make cuts of between 25 percent and 40 percent by 2020 below 1990 levels to avoid a catastrophic rise in sea levels, harsher storms and droughts and climate disruptions.",,,29,Mar,2010,HDU,Reporter,Vishwanath Kulkarni,New Delhi,India

The new draft text for negotiating a long-term agreement between more than 180 countries is out and has already stirred debate across the globe. The media hype that surrounded the December talks at the Danish capital may have dissipated but negotiators from key countries are prepared for this round of climate debates to be hectic and high-pitched as the last two years have shown. In the past few months, many countries such as India have reassessed their strategic approach to the contentious Copenhagen Accord. The BASIC countries â€” India, China, Brazil and South Africa â€” have taken a more stringent position on the accord than was expected when the Copenhagen meet ended. They have found several Trojan horses in the accord and in their formal submissions to the UN, that now form part of a new negotiating text for long term agreement, tried to block the entry of proposals that could be inimical to their interests. While almost all countries have given up hope of a complete agreement even by the end of this year in the big meet slated at Cancun, Mexico, the pressure remains to come up with some interim decisions and pacts. Sources in the Indian government note that the developed world seems keen to push for decisions on at least two fronts â€” forestry as a climate change solution and the contentious issue of measurement, verification and review (MRV) of climate change-preventing actions by developing and developed countries. While the former, forestry, provides a few virtual carrots for India â€” it could possibly bring in forestry-based carbon trade in the future â€” the MRV issue is bound to keep the Indian negotiators on their toes, trying to prevent any slip that would obfuscate the differences between rich and developing countries, at present embedded in the UN convention. The US has already signalled its desire to rubbish the """"common but differentiated principle"""" of the climate convention that has guided the talks so far. The US special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, recently said the principle was """"fatally flawed substantively and politically as a foundation for the future"""", indicating the next step for the biggest polluter, as is also made clear in its formal submission, to dismantle the UN regime further. Stern warns the principle is often 'wrongly' invoked for the """"proposition that developed countries must undertake legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while developing countries may, but are not obliged, to take voluntary measures"""". The Indian and other developing world negotiators will be battling for 12 days at Bonn to ensure that the Stern's beliefs do not get embedded in any new agreement that may be hammered out over this year.""",,,28,May,2010,TOI,PTI,PTI,New Delhi,National Water Mission gets nod of Council on Climate Change,NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change has given an in-principle clearance to the long pending National Water Mission â€” one of the eight missions planned under the National Action Plan on Climate Change.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/the-good-earth/National-Water-Mission-gets-nod-of-Council-on-Climate-Change/articleshow/5986487.cms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/the-good-earth/National-Water-Mission-gets-nod-of-Council-on-Climate-Change/articleshow/5986487.cms,IPL,,IP,,,IND,IA1,IB1,IC1,,national water mission,,ID2,,,IT6,,,,,,,,Adpt,,NAPCC,,,,,,,,28,May,2010,TOI,PTI,PTI,London,Carbon 'burp' from ocean started global warming,"LONDON: Scientists have claimed that a huge carbon ""burp"" from deep ocean kick-started global warming at end of the last Ice Age some 18,000 years ago. According to the scientists, the carbon dioxide was actually locked away in the deep ocean ""repository"" and as the Earth warmed, it was released into the atmosphere causing the global warming and ending the last Ice Age.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Carbon-burp-from-ocean-started-global-warming/articleshow/5984389.cms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Carbon-burp-from-ocean-started-global-warming/articleshow/5984389.cms,GS,SS,S,,,GLO,IA1,B4,C7,,University of Cambridge,,D1,,,T6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Extra,30,May,2010,TOI,PTI,,ST PETERSBURG,No global warning processes in Antarctic: Explorer,"ST PETERSBURG: Allegations about global warming processes in the Antarctic have nothing to do with real facts, a Russian polar explorer has said.

As this question keeps haunting people going restless because of the delayed arrival of monsoon, the weather office is trying to figure out the date for its onset. Though official sources did not give any new date, it is believed that the rains might start hitting Gujarat anytime around July 1. After the first spell on June 15-16, the monsoon kept the weather office on tenterhooks for its disappearing act. The central weather office is now reviewing the changing monsoon pattern in the country and plans to announce new trends and dates for various regions, including Gujarat. The central weather office felt the need to review the monsoon pattern as the current predictions are made on the basis of study during 1900-1980. Call it climate change or simply changing weather pattern, met department officials have been observing change and delay in monsoon pattern. Dr BP Yadav, director of forecasting at India Meteorological department (IMD), New Delhi, said: ""The dates and trends that the weather office currently has are based on the study of the pattern that persisted during 1900-1980. However, the rain pattern has certainly changed for the country and hence, weather the department is at present reviewing the pattern and trends of rain activity in various regions from 1980 to 2010. A meticulous study of monsoon onset dates and average rainfall of last 30 years is at present being conducted for 36 meteorological subdivisions."" Sources in local weather office confirmed that the review of the changing rain pattern in Gujarat was being conducted. And the average date for the onset of monsoon of last 30 years starting from 1980 is being reviewed. The forecasted date for monsoon for Gujarat has remained June 15 for long. However, the actual onset of monsoon has happened during June 24 to 29 for last five years. June 26 was the date of onset for Gujarat in 2005, in 2006 it was June 29, in 2007 the onset date was June 24, in 2008 the date was June 26, and in 2009 the date was June 24. ""The review of last two or three decades of rain pattern shows postponed onset of the monsoon, hence the actual date for monsoon in Gujarat needs to be corrected,"" said Dr Shital Lodhia, professor of climate change and impact management course run by Gujarat University.

Arriving on PCs on Tuesday and Macs shortly, the British-made Fate of the World puts players at the helm of a future World Trade Organisation-style environmental body with a task of saving the world by cutting carbon emissions or damning it by letting soaring temperatures wreak havoc through floods, droughts and fires.  The strategy game is already being hailed by gaming experts as a potential breakthrough for such social change titles, and welcomed by climate campaigners as a way of reaching new audiences.   While traditional mainstream games have focused on action, sports and increasingly casual genres, Fate of the World features data from real-world climate models, anecdotes from the polar explorer Pen Hadow and input from a team of scientists and economists in the U.S. and U.K. It has been developed by Oxford-based games designers Red Redemption, whose previous browser-based climate game for the BBC has been played more than a million times since it was launched in 2006.  Gobion Rowlands, chairman at Red Redemption and a board member of social gaming organisation Games for Change, said the game was inspired by his desire to make the subject more accessible and a drunken boast to Dr. Myles Allen, head of climate dynamics at Oxford University and a contributor to the last report by the U.N.'s climate science panel.  â€œMy wife was working on Allen's Climateprediction.net project [a project to use the power of home PCs to process climate model data], when he took me out for dinner. We got quite drunk, and I bragged that we could make a computer game about anything. He challenged us to make one about climate change.â€ù  Mr. Allen has provided the prediction models used in the game. â€œFor far too long, climate policy has been developed by unelected technocrats in smoke-free conference centres or through talk show soundbites,â€ù said Mr. Allen. â€œWhat I like about this game is that it allows people to experience, in an idealised world, of course, the kinds of decisions we are likely to confront, and makes it clear there are no easy answers: should we start mining methane clathrates [gas trapped in arctic ice], for example?â€ù  Tom Chatfield, gaming expert and the author of Fun Inc: Why Games Are the 21st Century's Most Serious Business, said: â€œThis could be the beginning of a flowering of issueâ€”led gaming. But it will be judged on whether it's a good game, not on whether it's worthy or not.â€ù He said that, although some mainstream titles â€” such as the Civilization franchise, which has sold more than six million copies â€” had touched on issues of sustainability and pollution before, most games with an overt social message often had a lower budget and gave a less polished experience.
