((VUpdated: Sun, Aug 01 2010. 08 51 PM IST\u000a\u000aShort-termism in US politics makes its presence felt abroad. When the US decides to withdraw troops from, say, Afghanistan to game its two-year Congressional election cycle, strategic affairs in India are affected. China wins and loses trade ties based on what influence US trade unions wield.\u000a\u000aThe same with climate change, except this affects the whole world. Ten days ago, leaders in the US Senate, the upper House, decided to put their efforts on ice. The Democratic Party, which controls both Houses of Congress and the White House, has dramatically diluted the scope of the legislation, saying it lacks the votes. Three months before elections, Democrats are running for cover.\u000a\u000aIndia should be worried at how the US\u2014de facto global leader\u2014has dropped the ball on such initiatives.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a sea change from a year ago, when the US House of Representatives enacted an ambitious law: Warts and all, at its centre was a cap-and-trade scheme, one that now won\u2019t be featured in the Senate package. That\u2019s a pity, because the world needs such market-based mechanisms to price carbon. But promising ideas about carbon taxes and technology transfers came crashing down after Copenhagen in December, all because the West tried to browbeat developing nations.\u000a\u000aThe Senate retreat at least gives developing nations such as India a similar silver lining: Carbon tariffs\u2014part of last year\u2019s House of Representatives act\u2014used to force dramatic emission cuts may be thrown out of the door. But that\u2019s not cause for wild celebration. India should continue to embrace, and convince the West, of the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d (that the West has to pay a higher price), one that\u2019s so far anchored global coordination.\u000a\u000aThe US, however, not only is unsympathetic to this principle, but also seems to be losing appetite for market mechanisms. In the past months, President Barack Obama has spent more time ranting about offshore oil drilling, and less discussing how to properly price carbon. He has even frittered precious political capital on healthcare.\u000a\u000aAt some point, US lawmakers will wake up to realize that political short-termism demands swift actions on climate change. At that point, if they start relying on eco-protectionism or command-and-control measures, then the rest of the world, too, will be paying a heavy price.\u000a\u000aHas momentum on climate change been lost?

a((VClimate change, till now a \u2018global' issue, is inserting itself into India's bilateral agenda as well. For, at David Cameron's initiative, it is to be a central leg of the strategic new U.K.-India relationship.\u000a\u000aBusiness collaboration goes \u2018green'\u000a\u000aCollaboration has begun with the U.K.-India Business Leaders Climate Group. Comprising well-known CEOs, the group will work jointly on national emissions-reduction strategies, private sector-driven low-carbon models, and synergistic business opportunities.\u000a\u000aGiven climate change's stated importance in the U.K.-India partnership, policy-makers and business leaders in both countries might find it useful to leaf through UNCTAD's just-released World Investment Report 2010: Investing in a Low-Carbon Economy, which examines global flows of \u2018low carbon' foreign direct investment and proposes strategies to encourage it.\u000a\u000aThe report makes two essential points, which if implemented could significantly enrich the U.K.-India initiative. One: transnational corporations should be factored into global efforts to mitigate climate change, since they are both principal greenhouse gas emitters and \u2018low carbon' technology innovators, Two: it might be time for governments to expand the climate change discourse beyond a single-minded focus on national targets to incorporate performance milestones for individual firms. (In fact, going a step further, U.K.'s Environment Minister has broached the subject of tradeable carbon credits for each individual Briton).\u000a\u000aIt also presents a number of ideas for the two nations to pilot within their partnership, while using their joint experience to advance the climate change effort at the global level. For instance, FDI could be mainstreamed into low-carbon development strategies, with both countries working together to promote and support low-carbon investors and encourage strategic technology. They also need to ensure that policies incentivise, reward, and create a market for low-carbon investments, while incorporating climate-friendly provisions (including low-carbon investment promotion and environmental exceptions) into investment agreements. The report also suggests the establishment of an international low-carbon technical assistance centre, combining a global low-carbon technology database with advisory and support services.\u000a\u000aThe most compelling idea is the creation of a single global standard for corporate greenhouse gas emissions disclosure, which would significantly boost the accuracy of emissions monitoring and correction. The report finds 87 of the world's 100 largest transnational corporations reporting on emissions, many voluntarily. But it also finds two common gaps in this reporting. First, nearly a half of those that report are failing to specify the source of emissions \u2014 i.e. own operations, value chain, or energy use. Second, only 21 disaggregate their emissions by country.\u000a\u000aIn choosing practical initiatives to seed the U.K.-India environmental partnership, the U.K. government and the Business Leaders Climate Group might encourage British TNCs in India to report in detail on their local greenhouse gas emissions. This would be the most powerful way by which to establish the U.K.'s dual commitment to India and environmental protection. It would also be a major step in advancing global and Indian \u2018best practice' in emissions disclosure.\u000a\u000aVoluntary carbon-emissions reporting\u000a\u000aCarbon disclosure is already a well-established practice in the U.K., and its Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) runs an annual survey of corporate emissions-reporting/ environmental management practices among British firms. By publicly reporting findings, CDP encourages firms to continually improve environmental performance, and keeps the public, policy-makers and investors in the loop. Since 2007, CDP has run a similar survey in India, funded by the British High Commission as part of its \u2018Low Carbon High Growth Programme. Survey results highlight areas for shared improvement.\u000a\u000aIn CDP 2009, Indian firms performed as well, if not better, than U.K. counterparts on basic parameters, such as measuring and recording emissions, separating them by source, and in setting reduction targets. But U.K. firms considerably outperform Indian counterparts in public reporting on a variety of key parameters, including emissions, reduction targets, and emissions forecasts. They are also far ahead in isolating, measuring and reporting value-chain emissions.\u000a\u000aMore important, many of U.K.'s top carbon disclosers \u2014 which outperform U.K. counterparts by a 20-points average \u2014 have a large and committed India presence. Among them are Unilever, Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline, Thomas Cook, Reckitt Benckiser, AstraZeneca, Aviva, and Royal Bank of Scotland, who outperform counterparts by 30 (out of a potential 100) points on the very parameters in which Indian firms are the weakest. All these firms are visible corporate citizens in India, and run active environmental and social responsibility programmes.\u000a\u000aThere is thus much scope for a productive U.K.-India partnership on improved carbon disclosure. With climate change now firmly on the corporate agenda, Indian firms are actively looking to develop best practice across a variety of related areas.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. and India in the global \u2018low-carbon' FDI picture\u000a\u000aA word of warning, though. While the U.K.-India environmental partnership is to rest on private sector collaboration, the World Investment Report shows that the U.K. is still a minor player in global low carbon FDI. . Only BP features in its ranking of Top 20 foreign direct investors in the alternative/renewable energy generation, and only three U.K. firms \u2014 BP, Bronzeoak, and D1 Oils \u2014 feature as Top 20 investors in environmental technologies manufacturing (i.e. the production of wind turbines, solar panels, bio-diesel plants, and other environmental equipment).\u000a\u000aBP made only nine of the 728 international greenfield investments in alternative/ renewable energy generation between 2003-2009; all these in developed economies. BP made twelve of the 806 greenfield international investments in environmental-technology manufacture in this period, ten in developed economies. Bronzeoak made six and D1 Oil five; all in developing economies. The World Investment Report provides no indication on the size of these various investments.\u000a\u000aThis data is based on UNCTAD's analysis of the 1,725 international greenfield investments and 281 mergers and acquisitions in renewables, recycling and low-carbon technology manufacturing between 2003-2009 \u2013 collectively worth US$344 billion. Of these, 806 greenfield investments were in environmental-technology manufacture: nearly a half in developing economies. The 728 greenfield alternative/renewable energy investments and the 129 greenfield recycling investments concentrated in developed economies. In all cases, India has been an important destination.\u000a\u000aThe report also surveyed 240 leading TNCs to find climate change squarely on their agenda. 45 per cent of respondents said they factor host countries' GHG emissions-reduction requirements in planning investments, 32 per cent use in-house technologies, know-how and skills to reduce GHG emission in foreign projects, and 31 per cent use international M&As to obtain technologies and other created assets related to emissions reductions.\u000a\u000aBalancing conflicting Indian interests\u000a\u000aBut, the more committed India becomes to a low-carbon paradigm, the more carefully its policymakers will need to balance conflicting Indian interests.\u000a\u000aTake solar power. The government's new policy on grid-connected projects targets 100 per cent local equipment sourcing. This requirement could be counter-productive, in limiting our solar industry to a handful of (relatively new) local suppliers, whose equipment is often costlier than international competitors'. Financing might also be more difficult initially, since financiers are more confident about tried-and-tested equipment. Most worryingly, we might be blocking our industry from immediate access to important solar innovations internationally.\u000a\u000aAnother case in point is thermal power, where cost is still the defining parameter for technology choice, as a result of which we now liberally source power equipment from China, although it is considerably more polluting than costlier European and American models. \u2014 Courtesy: U.N.

a((VSoon after petrol prices rose, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal , 66, started to walk to the office. He says this is meant to save public money as the state is in the red. Just last week, he asked the Centre to give HP special financial assistance because the budget was badly miscalculated by the 13th Finance Commission , which failed to add up salary, interest and pension liabilities in the way it should have. He spoke to Sanjay Sharma about political vendetta, George Fernandes and apples. Excerpts:\u000a\u000aIt is alleged that you have vitiated the political atmosphere in the state by slapping corruption cases on Union steel minister Virbhadra Singh . Is this true?\u000a\u000aNow that climate change has become a major concern, how do you justify your great enthusiasm for hydro electric power projects and cement plants?\u000a\u000aDespite Himachal Pradesh ranking high on the human development index, its per capita income continues to be very low. Why?\u000a\u000aYou shared a very close relationship with Atal Behari Vajpayee. In fact, it once prompted the then Haryana chief minister Bansi Lal and Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to ask how you managed to get money for your state from the PM?\u000a\u000aYou used to sit next to George Fernandes in Parliament. What was your impression of him?\u000a\u000aPunjab and Haryana have been opposing a special industrial package to Himachal Pradesh, saying industry is leaving their states. How do you react to that?\u000a\u000aHow do you react to Punjab\u2019s demand for royalty for water supply to Rajasthan?\u000a\u000aThe apple crop is increasingly disappointing. What are you doing about this?\u000a\u000aMore than one crore tourists flock to the state every year but there is hardly any improvement in the infrastructure. Could you comment.\u000a\u000aThe former CM is reaping what he sowed. Singh did not spare his colleagues, whom he framed. He did not leave me either. Singh has criticized my government even though the UPA government has judged it as the number one in implementing the 20-point programme. Other agencies have praised Himachal Pradesh\u2019s progress on the human development index and said it is the top state in north India. On the other hand, a magazine has given Virbhadra just 37 marks for his performance.My government has not sanctioned any cement plant but now that they have come up, we are forcing them to upgrade their technology. Yes, I did push for hydel power projects and even faced protests during the last election. But half the state\u2019s financial resources come from this sector alone. Now, we have made policy changes to allow only run-of-the-river projects and ensure release of 15% water even during the lean period to protect flora and fauna.Interestingly, awareness about climate change is trickling down even to the villages. The other day a woman sarpanch demanded that roads be built near her village because the apple crop is now growing at higher altitudes.A recent presentation by a professor on the impact of climate change has also left me disturbed. It made me realize how real and close the climate change threat is. The professor highlighted that Himachal Pradesh would be the worst affected state because it has 7% of the country\u2019s biodiversity. We have chalked out a nine-point programme in this direction and five Himalayan state chief ministers are in constant touch on these issues.Obviously because there is a lack of money for development. The problem is that people here prefer taking up jobs; they don\u2019t realize that they need to turn entrepreneurs.My codename in the PM\u2019s house was \u2018Anytime Appointee\u2019. In 1999, I had asked for an economic package of Rs 400 crore from Vajpayeeji. I did not want to ask publicly as Vajpayeeji did not like it. But one of my colleagues raised the demand. So, Vajpayeeji gave Himachal Pradesh Rs 200 crore. I was unhappy with that. Later, he asked me to call the press and in front of them announced a package of Rs 400 crore for the state.George is one of the finest, most knowledgeable parliamentarians. His pocket would have holes and usually coins would fall out of it. But he always had little money in his pocket. I often saw Advaniji and George helping each other in their speeches. George would call Advaniji \u2018Lalji\u2019 and Advani would call him George. Whenever the two got stuck in their speeches, they would ask me to convey to the other person to pitch in.I am not opposed to a special package for these states as long as the ones meant for Himachal Pradesh are not discontinued. Even otherwise, Baddi in Himachal Pradesh has attracted pharma companies from Maharashtra and Gujarat.I support it as it\u2019s our old demand. All states including Punjab should give royalty to Himachal Pradesh as rivers are flowing from the hill state.We are now distributing new roots to change the 100-year-old roots. There are some encouraging signs though. We now see apples from warmer places like Una and Bilaspur in May and June. Interestingly, the state is now growing mangoes.We have been discriminated against in terms of air and rail connectivity. In a month or so, we will be starting a heli-ta-xi service.

Once the data is available for development of benchmarks, cement manufacturers will work to develop performance indicators and benchmarks for evaluating emission reduction potentials,\u201d said R. Kannan, chief consultant, ENERGi Services.\u000a\u000aAlready, TANCEM has reduced power consumption by 4.4 per cent and fuel consumption by 12.7 per cent in its two plants in 2009-10.\u000a\u000aLowest power consumption\u000a\u000aThe Ariyalur plant achieved the lowest power consumption of 21 units per tonne in raw metal ground since its inception, officials said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the latest policy note of the industries department, TANCEM will install cooler electro static precipitators to arrest the fugitive emission from clinker cooler at Rs.7.5 crore, six online stack emission monitors at Rs.33 lakh and a waste heat recovery system costing Rs.25 lakh in its Ariyalur plant this fiscal.\u000a\u000aStudies on implementation of clean development mechanism (CDM) to cut down carbon emissions and capture commercial potential of clean coal technology at Ariyalur unit, to capture CO2 from flue gas and improve calorific value of coal and usage of alternative fuels like scraped tyres, waste oil and sludge are on the anvil, officials said.\u000a\u000aModernisation of Alangulam plant, tree plantations and wind mills in 200 acres in Pollachi on the anvil

a((VThe Youth to Youth foundation together with the MCCIA launched \u2018Novatians\u2019 on Saturday,which will act as a platform for young students who have developed innovative models to reduce carbon emissions\u000a\u000aYoung minds bursting with innovative ideas need the right platform to showcase their talent. The city is giving them just that with various organisations coming forward to fund their projects and assist them in showcasing their work. The Youth to Youth foundation and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce,Industries and Agriculture ( MCCIA) joined hands to launch \u2018Novatians\u2019,the titans of innovation,on Saturday at the MCCIA office (Senapati Bapat Road). Novatians is an attempt to bring together youth who have come up with innovative ideas and developed models that can serve as viable options for reducing carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aThe Youth to Youth foundation is a five-year-old organisation that has played an important role in mobilising the young force of Pune to address diverse societal concerns. At the launch,Ameya Jagtap,president of the organisation,said,“An innovation is more of a human attitude than talent. You need to have the urge to bring about a change. Through this initiative,we will try to inspire the youth to think out of the box. We will also help them meet people who might fund their projects and models,thereby ensuring that the lack of funds does not hamper the youth from coming up with innovative ideas.”\u000a\u000aStressing on the need for such a platform for young minds,Gantavya Sharma,coordinator of Novatians,said,“The process,right from the innovation and formation of the product to taking it to the market,is a difficult one. Novatians will act as the connecting factor between the innovators and the market by providing them with funds. This will give them a push to take up more projects.”\u000a\u000aChief Guest A D Sahasrabuddhe,director of College of Engineering Pune (COEP),added,“In our days,there was little or absolutely no scope for encouragement of talent. Today,the advent of technology and also platforms like Novatians has made it much easier for students to showcase their talents on a broader platform. Students should make full use of these opportunities.”\u000a\u000aThe event also saw students making presentations of their models. Shachi Pande,a student of COEP,who along with five other students,has come up with the unique idea of charging a cell phone while walking,said,“Novatians is a good way for us to meet people who will understand and show interest in our projects. Through this initiative,we will also get to meet other innovators. For instance,we just came to know about other models like a photo clipping machine,a river cleaning project and a hybrid power generator.”\u000a\u000aSince the process of patenting a new machine or device is very important to any invention,Novatians will also hold various seminars and workshops to make the students understand the process in a better way. “It is difficult to understand the process of patenting if you do not have someone to guide you. Through these workshops and seminars,we will be able to meet people who can explain the concept. This is extremely important for innovators like us,” said Rahul Bedarkar,another student who participated in the event.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App

a((VThe United States assured international negotiators Monday it remains committed to reducing carbon emissions over the next 10 years, despite the collapse of efforts to legislate a climate bill.\u000a\u000aU.S. delegate Jonathan Pershing told a climate conference in Bonn, Germany, Washington is not backing away from President Barack Obama's pledge to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels. Pershing said legislation is the preferred way to control greenhouse gases, but the administration "will use all the tools available" to reach its target.\u000a\u000aObama made the pledge at a climate summit in Copenhagen last December, and affirmed it in a formal note to the U.N. climate secretariat. At the time, the U.S. House of Representatives had passed a climate bill and the Senate had been broadly expected to follow suit.\u000a\u000aBut the withdrawal of a scaled down climate bill last week in the Senate raised concern about America's commitment to fight global warming and disappointed developing countries that had hoped Obama would seize international leadership on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe European Union said the failure of the bill encumbered its talks among its own 27 member states on whether the EU should increase its pledge to rein in the gases blamed for global warming. "It hasn't made the discussion and the debate any easier in Europe," Artur Runge-Metzger, the European Commissioner for climate change.\u000a\u000aThe EU has promised to cut emissions by 20 percent below 1990 over the next decade, but said it would raise its target to 30 percent if the U.S. and other major polluters adopt similarly tough goals.\u000a\u000aDelegations from 178 countries began five days of work Monday, resuming painstaking discussions on an agreement to limit global emissions and prepare poor countries for the effects of a warming world.\u000a\u000aDelegates pointed to the lethal floods in Pakistan as an example of a the extreme weather events that scientists say will become more common as average temperatures rise.\u000a\u000aAs if to underscore the global warming threat, U.N. officials lifted the coat-and-tie rules for the week, citing soaring temperatures in Bonn and a desire to lower the air conditioning to reduce the conference's emissions.\u000a\u000aOne more round of talks is scheduled in Tianjin, China, in October before the next major climate conference Nov. 29-Dec 10 in Cancun, Mexico.\u000a\u000aAcknowledged widespread concern over the U.S. position, Pershing said many delegates had asked him about the status of its pledge and the chances of a deal in Cancun.\u000a\u000a"Success in Cancun does not hinge on U.S. legislation," he told some 3,000 delegates, businessmen and activists attending the talks. Environmental groups warned that the setback in Washington should not deter other countries, and called on the EU to take the lead.\u000a\u000a"Parties should not allow U.S. domestic politics to lower the overall level of ambition of an international agreement," said Manuel Oliva, of Conservation International.\u000a\u000aA study by World Resources Institute said the Obama administration could reach the 17 percent goal without passing a sweeping climate bill by using existing powers, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency; by issuing new regulations and executive orders; and through piecemeal energy legislation, Oliva said.\u000a\u000aThe talks in Bonn and Tianjin aim to prepare a successor agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which calls on industrial countries to reduce emissions but makes no demands of developing countries like China and India, which are now among the largest polluters.\u000a\u000aThe United States rejected Kyoto as imbalanced and unfair, but said it will join a new climate regime as long as it is "symmetrical," encompassing all major emitters. The emissions-controlling terms of the Kyoto accord expire in 2012, a deadline that has delegates worried about leaving a vacuum unless a new agreement is in place, the so-called Kyoto gap. Negotiations have stumbled along for 2 years.\u000a\u000aThe original intention was to seal an agreement in Copenhagen, but that summit of 120 world leaders in the Danish capital only managed to agree on a brief political statement of intentions.\u000a\u000aThe top U.N. climate official, Christiana Figueres, said it may be unnecessary to complete a full agreement in Cancun. It was up to the countries to decide whether they want to make it legally binding or a series of less enforceable decisions.\u000a\u000aBut she said by the Cancun conference begins wealthy countries should have made the first payment of a $30 billion three-year promise of emergency climate funds to poor countries.\u000a\u000a"Developing nations see the allocation of this money as a critical signal that industrialized nations are committed to progress in the broader negotiations," said Figueres.

a((VKolkata: Meet the green traveller on a global mission.He has crossed 22,000 km in a wonder van without using a drop of diesel or any other fossil fuel. His van, fitted with a solar panel roof, runs on bio-fuel and aims to produce the least possible carbon footprint while going around the world. Andy Pag, a British mechanical engineer-cum-renewable energy exponent who reached Kolkata on Sunday, says largescale use of bio-diesel can make the carbon emission target of 2 tonnes per capita per year achievable.To reduce the risk of a 5?C rise in global temperatures from 50% to 3%, experts have agreed to reduce CO2 emissions to 2 tonnes per person per year by 2050. "Currently, the carbon footprint per capita per year in the UK is 10-12 tonnes per capita per year and 15-18 tonnes in the US. A massive development spree in India and China and explosion of automobiles have suddenly pushed it beyond 5-6 tonnes per capita per year from less than 2 tonnes in these two countries. As India and China have large populations, the impact is quite telling," said Andy Pag at Emami Tower, which houses Emami Biotech, the biggest producer of bio-diesel in eastern India.The bio-truck expedition, as Andy's trip is known, seeks to find out how other people are cutting their footprint while travelling on a "sustainable carbon budget" himself.Andy rebuilt his vehicle from "rubbish". He designed it to suit his needs with a 1,200-litre tank and filter to reduce viscosity of waste vegetable oil recycled from restaurants and individual kitchens. His solar panel ensures that his refrigerator runs uninterrupted and he gets enough light to study at night and charge his laptop."Europe has a very efficient network of recycling of waste oil from individual kitchens and restaurants. New ideas on sources of waste are being developed as commercial projects in the quest to meet the demand. Uptown Oils, one of my sponsors, is working with sewer grease, which has to be scraped out of drains," said Andy.However, the trip hasn't been as smooth as Andy had thought. Unaware of the laws of countries he passed through, his satellite phone landed him in jail once. "The experience in jail was quite enlightening," Andy wrote on his blog. "This court case has cost me Euro 6,000 while I spent about Euro 3,000 on three months of travel from the UK to India, which was meant to be one of the cheaper legs of the journey.

From France, it has been a long and eventful journey. "I travelled through Italy, Croatia, Turkey , war-ravaged Iran, Pakistan and entered India through Punjab on December 22. In Pakistan, I got an army escort to travel though Balochistan," he said.At Emami Tower, Andy filled up his tank, which he thinks would take care of his journey through Indonesia and Australia. "I strongly feel that India should clear all obstacles to commercial use of bio-diesel. This would be a great leap forward in reducing its carbon footprint." Andy is expected to leave Kolkata on August 10."Though the ministry of renewable energy is pushing for its use, the ministry of petroleum is creating stumbling blocks for its commercial use. So far, all bio-diesel plants in the nation are idle, thanks to the government's policies," said Aditya Agarwal , director of Emami Group of Industries.

a((VThe new T3 terminal in Delhi made the airport in the capital the first in the country to adopt the more environment-friendly Fixed Electrical Ground Power (FEGP) on all its 78 aero-bridges; the airport in the financial capital will have to wait at least another two years before it can get the same facility.\u000a\u000aReason: the systems were not installed by the Airports Authority of India at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and Mumbai International Airport Ltd can put them in place only when the new,integrated Terminal 2 is ready at the end of 2012.\u000a\u000aFEGP has the potential to save airlines tonnes of money annually by cutting down on expensive air turbine fuel (ATF) while also reducing emissions and noise pollution.\u000a\u000aAcross the world,airports are moving towards adopting the more environment-friendly Fixed Electrical Ground Power (FEGP) units at the airports. Not to be left behind,in June the Indian regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued its first aviation environment circular for the year,by asking Indian airports to also affect this move. No other airport besides Delhi has FEGPs in India.\u000a\u000aA MIAL spokesperson said that CSIA had inherited the infrastructre from Airports Authority of India (AAI),which did not come with FEGPs installed. “The CSIA airport in Mumbai will also get FEGPs when the integrated Terminal 2 comes up at the end of 2012,” he said.\u000a\u000aFEGPs can act as an alternative to the ATF powered Auxillary Power Units (APU) of the aircraft. After an aircraft lands and its main engines are turned off,it switches on to the Auxiliary Power unit for power and the all important on-board air-conditioning back up. At many metro airports,in the absence of FEGP,airlines opt for the less expensive diesel run Ground power unit (GPU) and air-conditioning carts as an alternative to the APU after landing.\u000a\u000a“Experts feel that than an FEGP is 6-25 times less expensive than an Auxillary Power Unit (APU),depending on the aircraft type. An European Union study shows that use of FEGP and PCA (Pre conditioned air) instead of APU reduces GHG emissions up to 40 per cent,” said Amber Dubey,Director,Aerospace and Defence,at the consultant firm KPMG.\u000a\u000aAt the IGI airport in Delhi,an airport officer said that airlines could expect to cut costs by at least a third or a fourth using an FEGP. “Even if they save a few hundred rupees with each flight,it would save them a lot of money on an annual basis,” he said.\u000a\u000aAt many European airports however it is mandatory to use the FEGP. “At Heathrow,the FEGP user charges are less than Rs 900/ hr which is significantly lower than the cost of ATF burnt by APUs which works out to Rs 5000 per hr (B727) to Rs 7000 (A320) to around Rs 18,000 (B747),” Dubey said.\u000a\u000aLast year,when the air fuel costs were sky rocketing,Air India which has around 200 GPUs across the country issued a circular asking its pilots to switch off its Auxillary power Unit as much as possible and turn to the diesel run Ground Power unit and the air-conditioning carts. But pilots and engineers say in India,non-metro airports like Lucknow,Amritsar do not even have GPUs in place; and air conditioning carts are even more rare to find. Sometimes even if they do have the GPU,it would make little sense to opt for it if the turnaround time for an aircraft is less than an hour.\u000a\u000aAirline officials say,a switch over from the GPU to the FEGP at Indian airports would be more appealing if it makes economic sense. “At some airports abroad,the user charge for an FEGP is more expensive than running an APU. So even if it is much more quieter ¿ which makes sense especially at night,and environmentally sound,airlines will look at economics and prefer to run the APU,” he said.\u000a\u000aRain forces runway to shut for 20 minutes\u000a\u000aThe main runway 09/27 at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport was closed for 20 minutes on Tuesday afternoon after heavy rain,which led to waterlogging and some cracks on the runway surface,disrupted the services. As the secondary runway has not been in use because of the monsoon,all operations at CSIA were shut for 20 minutes.\u000a\u000aAccording to a Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) spokesperson,the surface of the main runway had to be urgently repaired,after heavy rains caused some damage. “The runway was closed from 12.40 pm to 1 pm for urgent maintenance work,” he said.\u000a\u000aThe MIAL undertakes regular maintenance work on Tuesday from 12 noon to 2 pm. However,they have not been able to follow this schedule in the recent past because of continuous rains. As a result of this closure,one arriving Kingfisher flight from Delhi was diverted to Ahmedabad,which later landed in Mumbai. “This unexpected closure resulted in some delays,” an ATC officer said.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App

a((VNo one expected a bang; but the idea of a cap on Americas carbon emissions died with barely the bathos of a whimper. Despite months of legislative fiddle piled on procedural faddle, no one ever drafted a bill with a carbon cap, and the sort of trading system necessary for industry to meet its demands, that stood a chance on the Senate floor. So the majority leader, Harry Reid, finally decided the whole issue should be quietly flushed away. With the mid-term elections sure to swing heavily away from Reids Democrats, there is now no possibility of comprehensive climate-change legislation in America for years.\u000a\u000aGiven the murkiness of some of the bathwater involved (maybe well let you have a little cap and trade if youll let us go on emitting neurotoxic mercury, said the electric utilities), it is easy to lose track of the attractions of the baby. America is the largest per-person emitter of carbon dioxide among the worlds big economies, and the second-largest emitter overall. If the risks of global damage through climate change are to be reduced, Americas emissions need to come under some sort of control, both because of what they do to the climate and because of the message such control would send to the worlds other large emittersand in particular to China, the largest.\u000a\u000aIn his election campaign, Barack Obama spoke enthusiastically of a cap-and-trade scheme; so did his opponent, John McCain. But Obama never made it a high priority, and McCain, back in the Senate, maintained a sulky silence on the subject. Opposition by the Republican minority marked a triumph of politics over policy: some Republicans recognise the risks of climate change and the appeal of cap and trade. But it was Democrats who killed the bill.\u000a\u000aOver to the EPA\u000a\u000aA significant number of Democrats from states dependent on coal would not vote for cap and trade when the economy was weak and tight elections loomed. Pressure from their voters could have swayed them; but public support for climate action, though fairly broad, is rarely deep. In its absence the blandishments of a well-funded environmental lobby, the sporadic half-throated encouragement of the White House and the not entirely convincing rhetoric on green jobs from their colleagues on the left could not shift them. To hope that a tranche of Republicans might make good the numbers when a block of Democrats wouldnt was to ask far too much of principle in a polarised political atmosphere. Americas emissions will not go unabated. The Environmental Protection Agency is now legally required to act on carbon dioxide. Utilities will be obliged to buy renewable energy and encouraged to build nuclear plants. But such progress will be modest, ill co-ordinated and inefficiently won, while also drawing on the public purse. One of the attractions of cap and trade was that it raised money which might be spent on measures such as grid improvements and the development and deployment of new research: some technology push to make market pull go farther. Much of this would have been pork-barrel spending, but at least the cap-and-trade system brought in its own pork; energy-only bills do not.\u000a\u000aDamage will also be done to the momentum of international negotiations and Americas leadership role within themweak sisters to begin with. When America helped to broker the Copenhagen accord last year, its aim was to level the playing field between rich countries that made commitments and poor ones that didnt. Offering no legislative commitment at all rather makes a mockery of that goal. Optimists can see a bright side. Cap and trade was sold as the easiest way of limiting emissions: pragmatic, politically acceptable, offering hard caps on emissions, which greens want, and the possibility of free carbon credits, which companies want. But it is not the only way. And the main alternative, a carbon tax, is in many ways preferable.\u000a\u000aNow that cap and trade has proved unacceptable, expect a swing back towards carbon taxes in policy circles. During a wholesale revision of the tax code they might yet have their day. But expect, too, that the countrys emissions will come down only slowly; and that the worlds will continue to rise.\u000a\u000aThe Economist Newspaper Limited

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe European Parliament's decision to end the import of illegally harvested timber and timber products into EU member countries from 2012 is a welcome step towards better protection of the world's forests. Considering that an estimated 20 per cent of the wood coming into the European Union is felled in violation of the laws of the source country, the new rules that require the importers to document the chain of supply and the authorities to conduct periodic inspections are a major improvement on existing regulations that rely on certification in the country of origin. The importers will now have to identify the source of supply at every level. This provision ensures or enables transparency, traceability, and verification. The move to ban illegal timber could not have come sooner. There is grave concern for the forests in the Amazon, in several African countries, in Asia, and also in Russia, as rising consumption has contributed to massive deforestation. It is worth recalling that the State of the World's Forests 2009 forecast continuing deforestation in Asian countries, in Africa, and in Latin America owing to pressure for agricultural land, cultivation of biofuel crops, and higher consumer demand. It is significant, therefore, that the EU has struck a blow for forest protection with a law that makes import of timber obtained illegally a punishable offence. The national governments have been given time to legislate penalties for violations of the law.\u000a\u000aA more aggressive international regime to save old-growth, biodiversity-rich forests from environmentally unsustainable logging is top priority. United Nations estimates put the share of industrial wood coming from illegal sources in the range of 20-40 per cent of the total. In some countries such as Liberia, the proceeds of such destructive commerce have been used to fund armed conflict. In the case of Madagascar, the military-compelled resignation last year of President Marc Ravalomanana has exposed pristine forests to felling. It is encouraging that the United States, which receives a lot of the illegal wood from this naturally unique island, has used the Lacey Act (which has objectives similar to the new EU measure) to prosecute importers. Preservation of forests is also central to the campaign against climate change. Here, the U.N.-mediated effort to create a compensation mechanism for countries that adopt conservation measures is a good way forward. With sufficient international legal cooperation to curb unlawful trade and a parallel mechanism to reward sincere national governments, it should be possible to make destruction of forests less and less attractive.

a((VThe waste-pickers who scour the world's rubbish dumps and daily recycle thousands of tonnes of metal, paper and plastics are up in arms against the U.N., which they claim is forcing them out of work and increasing climate change emissions.\u000a\u000aTheir complaint, heard on Wednesday in Bonn where the U.N. global climate change talks have resumed. The pickers say the clean development mechanism (CDM), an ambitious climate finance scheme designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, has led to dozens of giant waste-to-energy incinerators being built to burn municipal rubbish, as well as hundreds of new landfill schemes designed to collect methane gas.\u000a\u000a\u201cWaste-pickers, who are some of the poorest people on earth, recover recyclable materials. They are invisible entrepreneurs on the frontline of climate change, earning a living from recovery and recycling, reducing demand for natural resources,\u201d says Neil Tangri, director of Gaia, an alliance of 500 anti-incinerator groups in 80 countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut they are being undermined by CDM projects, which deny them entry to dumps. This is leading to further stress and hardship for some of the poorest people in the world and is increasing emissions,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWaste-pickers handle much of the growing mountains of rubbish in developing countries. Nearly 60 per cent of all Delhi's waste, for example, is recycled by an army of tens of thousands of pickers who scavenge for recyclable materials on the city's dumps.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese workers are providing a public service \u2014 for free. Building incinerators robs the poorest of the poor,\u201d said Bharati Chaturvedi, director of Indian NGO Chintan which works with waste-pickers and has been opposing a giant incinerator being built in Delhi with CDM money.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Gaia called for the CDM to stop approving incinerator waste to energy projects and to start investing climate funds in the informal recycling sector. This, it said, would increase employment and labour conditions while dramatically reducing emissions.\u000a\u000aGaia also argues that the U.N.'s methodology for assessing whether projects should be granted CDM credits does not take into account the emissions saved by recycling.\u000a\u000aRecycling and composting, it says, are nearly 25 times more effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions than waste-to-energy incinerators.\u000a\u000a\u201cCDM funding for incineration and landfills represents a lost opportunity to reduce pollution and help improve the welfare of some of the poorest people on earth. This funding incentivises the destruction of valuable resources that would otherwise have been recovered with significant climate benefits.\u201d But a spokeswoman for the CDM said on Thursday that waste-to-energy incinerators saved emissions and provided new employment. \u201cThese projects would not have taken place without the CDM\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut she said the CDM would welcome groups of waste-pickers who wanted to apply for U.N. climate credits. \u201cIf they can show, with the correct methodology, that they are saving emissions, they would be eligible, too,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe CDM, set up in 2001, allows rich countries to offset their emissions by investing in projects that reduce emissions in poor countries. In nearly 10 years' operation it claims to have reduced emissions significantly worldwide but has been accused of allowing fraud by unscrupulous industrialists who have found ways to register projects that would have been built anyway.\u000a\u000aIncinerator plants are some of the largest sources of urban protests in both rich and poor countries, with people living near them, or downwind of them, concerned over cancers and other illnesses. These concerns are strongly denied by incinerator and city authorities who have invested billions of dollars in new plants. \u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

a((VNew Delhi, Aug. 5: For your sake, and earth’s sake, have fish instead of mutton. If you are truly climate-friendly, go bananas. According to a study that analysed greenhouse gas emissions associated with a set of common Indian food items, fish is a superior alternative to mutton, not just for humans but also for the planet’s health, while bananas are the most climate-friendly. The study, by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, says mutton has the highest global warming potential among the food items analysed. The exercise involved assessing greenhouse gas emissions during each stage of the life cycle of the food item from the farm to the dinner plate — production, processing and cooking — to generate a comparative chart. The study, published this week in the journal Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment, has shown that a kilogram of mutton has a global warming potential 12 times higher than a kilogram of fish. The global warming potential of poultry meat — chicken or duck — is only slightly higher than that of fish. And milk and curd are associated with higher emissions than eggs. “Ruminants — whether for mutton or for milk — are associated with methane emissions,” said Himanshu Pathak, a senior soil scientist in the environmental division at the IARI and the lead author of the study. Livestock belch out or release methane gas as they digest their food. And a methane molecule released into the atmosphere, Pathak said, has a 25 times greater capacity for trapping heat than a carbon dioxide molecule. Rice, meat, dairy products and fish are associated with high methane emissions while wheat, vegetables and fruits contribute to an oxide of nitrogen — another greenhouse gas that has an even greater heat-trapping capacity than methane. Bananas had the least global warming potential, according to the IARI analysis. Much of the emissions associated with bananas emerge from their transportation from plantations to retail outlets. The IARI researchers say the study was designed to generate raw data about the global warming potential of Indian food items, and is not intended to get people to tweak their food habits for the sake of the planet. Medical studies have long suggested that white meat — fish or poultry — is better for human health than red meat such as mutton. “We need to generate our own greenhouse gas emissions data,” said Pathak. He recalled how Indian scientists were caught by surprise in the early 1990s when US researchers suggested that India’s paddy fields were producing a large amount of methane. The claim prompted an indigenous investigation which showed that the US estimate was much higher than the actual methane contribution of paddy. The IARI study indicates that transportation of food in India contributes only one per cent to the emissions. Studies in Europe suggest that transportation accounts for 8 per cent to 30 per cent of food emissions. The IARI team also computed the global warming potential for balanced meals — vegetarian and non-vegetarian — consumed by Indian men and women. It found the levels lower (583g to 1,031g carbon dioxide equivalent per day) than the per capita global warming potential linked to food consumption (1,200g to 1,500g carbon dioxide equivalent per day) in some industrialised countries. “Data on global warming potential of food items may be used to either change personal options or to guide future policy decisions on crops,” Pathak said. “It’s important to have such data based on scientific research.” Future research, the researchers say, could focus on rice with lower methane emissions — for example, aerobic rice, which does not need to be cultivated in fully submerged fields, or direct-seeded rice.

Singh on Friday demanded setting-up of a special fund to meet the challenges of global warming and climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Environment Adaptation and Mitigation Fund (EAMF) could be constituted by innovative fiscal policies,\u201d Singh said, moving a resolution in the Rajya Sabha.\u000a\u000aThe fund could be used to finance the cost of technology and promote research and development or renewable energy to meet situations arising out of global warming and climate change, he said.\u000a\u000aHe appealed to the government to adopt the resolution, saying the fund could be\u000a\u000aconstituted by imposing a\u000a\u000acarbon tax, taxing small fossil fuel power generation units, fixing a surcharge on per capita energy usage above a particular level and general budgetary support.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis initiative would allow Ministries and other bodies to apply for additional funding, resources additional to what the budget has allocated,\u201d the former Revenue Secretary said.\u000a\u000aHis suggestion was supported by many MPs. Former minister Mani Shankar Aiyar emphasised on revisiting former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s idea of establishing a Planet Protection Fund (PPF).\u000a\u000aAiyar said the PPF under the aegis of the UN for protecting the environment was proposed to be set up through global efforts.

It's also time to learn from the terrible summer they are having.\u000a\u000aTemperatures have risen above 30 degrees, the hottest in Moscow for over a century, possibly a consequence of climate change. Amongst the disasters is the decline in wheat outputs due to drought. The Financial Times reports that this might be as much as 30m tons! Russian exports stand banned till December this year. Since Russia is the world's third largest wheat exporter, global wheat prices have gone up. There's going to be less to eat for every rupee spent globally.\u000a\u000aTurn to India. We are as ill prepared for this disaster as we are for the Commonwealth Games. This paper exposed the scandal of our rotting grain and children eating mud in its Tracking Hunger series. Can you recall that over 10,688 tonnes of grain has been lying damaged in the Food Corporation of India's depots, in part because it was in the open? Or that the government is unwilling to spend money distributing grain to the poor, so it lies under tarpaulin sheets?\u000a\u000aThis summer's lesson: the right to food security is key to climate change adaptation. Our government must do this by through ensuring minimal employment so the poor can afford food, implement all its nutrition related schemes, ensure the mid-day meal system is not a mockery, and revitalize the public distribution system. That would be a robust first step to tacking climate change. Nothing less will work.\u000a\u000aOil's not Well\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, two ships collided just off Mumbai and an oil spill followed. No one knows how big or small it is, because there is no clear information. People need information to protect themselves. Is fisherman's catch safe to eat? Are the beaches safe for children? Can locals help monitor the situation? We can't answer these key issues without information freely available. We need a ruling where, during any disaster, big or small, all available official data must be fed into the public domain.

On Monday, United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon said the climate change summit at Cancun later this year might not see such an agreement. The stalemate at Copenhagen last year, and recently at Bonn, is sufficient indicator of the difficulties in reaching a broad consensus on the subject. But when the top cheerleader for the negotiations admits this, it\u2019s cause for concern.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s because the last time the world met on climate change, the costs outweighed the benefits.

a((VUpdated: Wed, Aug 11 2010. 09 45 AM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: In July 2008, international oil prices spiked to a record $148 (Rs6,852.4 today) per barrel, ruining the fiscal math for countries such as India that are overwhelmingly dependent on imports. In the case of India, which imports 80% of its annual consumption, the oil import bill was up 26% to Rs3.4 trillion in 2008-09. It could have been worse but for the fact that the onset of the global meltdown choked off some of the domestic demand as manufacturing firms scaled down capacities.\u000a\u000aThe latest oil shock has re-emphasized the urgency for India to evolve a solution to secure its energy needs such that they mitigate, if not preclude, such economic shocks. All the more so because the existing energy plan envisages India\u2019s dependency on imports to increase to 90% by 2030\u2014a period in which it strives to achieve double-digit growth as part of a strategy to push for greater inclusiveness. This is not surprising given that its consumption of petroleum products has grown at an annual compounded growth rate of around 4% in the last seven years and, according to the International Energy Agency, consumption is expected to rise to 135 million tonnes (mt) per annum by 2012 from 112 mt now.\u000a\u000aBroadly, the required energy security strategy has two strands. At one level the country needs to secure stable supplies of energy to meet growing demand. At another, India needs to evolve fuel efficiency standards that will not only ensure efficacy in consumption but also incentivize alternative forms of energy such as solar power.\u000a\u000aWhile the move by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in June to free prices of petrol totally and that of diesel partially has created a fresh inflationary impetus, it is also part of a larger plan to manage demand for petroleum products and reduce fiscal pressure on the Central exchequer through funding of subsidies incurred by selling petroleum products below cost price.\u000a\u000aAlso Read | Earlier articles in the India Agenda series\u000a\u000aThe situation in power generation, too, is equally precarious. India is not generating enough electricity to sustain its economic growth and the country is facing a peak power shortage of 13% between 5pm and 11pm. Even if the generation capacity is enhanced, critical issues relating to transmission and distribution\u2014which lead to a leakage of 40%\u2014have to be resolved.\u000a\u000aSeized of the problem, UPA set up a group of ministers (GoM) under the chairmanship of Pranab Mukherjee to ensure an \u201cexternal interface for energy security\u201d. \u201cThe GoM will look for opportunities across energy sectors... It will look at energy resources available in other countries and how to go about securing them,\u201d power secretary P. Umashankar said.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, state-owned firms such as ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), are locked in a fierce competition for energy assets with rivals including China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), Sinopec Corp. and CNOOC Ltd in Africa and South America. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for more than 80% of global growth in oil refining in 2009, largely due to a capacity increase in India and China.\u000a\u000aGraphic: Ahmed Raza Khan / Mint A similar import dependency is arising in coal as domestic supplies are unable to meet rapidly growing demand. The power sector is the biggest consumer of coal in the country, absorbing 78% of total domestic production. India has 75 thermal power projects that depend on Coal India Ltd (CIL), which accounts for 82% of the country\u2019s coal production, for fuel supplies. In 2009-10, CIL produced 431.27 mt as opposed to the target of 435 mt.\u000a\u000aThe outlook on natural gas supplies is similar. While applications requesting gas allocations for new power plants requiring over 550 million standard cu. m a day (mscmd) of gas have been received, the country\u2019s current production is only 142 mscmd\u2014implying that 400 mscmd will have to be imported, though this could drop marginally when domestic production picks up over the next few years.\u000a\u000aClearly, there are limited options available to India if it has to rely on conventional sources of energy alone. The imperatives for exploring alternative and increasingly renewable energy options have grown as the world seeks to evolve a consensus on containing climate change. Even if India was to extract concessions at the ongoing negotiations, its options are going to be limited.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is obvious that India needs a durable energy security policy considering our country\u2019s energy requirements. We need to diversify our sources so that we are less dependent on imported oil that depletes our foreign exchange reserves. We need to get into new and renewable energy sources,\u201d said K.V. Rajan, former secretary, east, in India\u2019s ministry of external affairs.\u000a\u000autpal.b@livemint.com\u000a\u000aPadmaparna Ghosh contributed to this story.

a((VUpdated: Wed, Aug 11 2010. 12 37 AM IST\u000a\u000aEnergy security in its widest connotation is the continuous and sustainable availability of energy in its varied forms in sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. India\u2019s Integrated Energy Policy Report of 2006 made the definition more onerous by extending it to an obligation to supply lifeline energy to all our citizens irrespective of their ability to pay for it, as well as meet their effective demand for safe and convenient energy to satisfy their various needs at competitive prices, at all times and with a prescribed confidence level considering shocks and disruption that can be reasonably expected. The required administrative and commercial arrangements to meet this obligation are obviously daunting, to say the least.\u000a\u000aIn the foreseeable future, till 2031-32, if we are to eradicate poverty, the economy has to grow between 8% and 10%. The availability and access to energy are the catalysts for inclusive growth and are major instruments for the eradication of poverty. To attain the projected level of growth and to meet the prescribed lifeline needs of providing 30 units of electricity and 6kg of liquefied petroleum gas or equivalent kerosene through a system of smart cards, we need to increase our primary energy supply three-four times, and the electricity generation and supply capacity five-six times above the 2003-4 levels. This growth ideally should be attained in a sustainable manner while addressing climate change concerns.\u000a\u000aIt can be safely said that at the moment we are far from securing our energy requirements. We need a change in mindset. Energy security cannot be ensured by the Central energy ministry. It needs the full backing of the ministries of finance, environment and forests, labour and human resource development. If India is to attain its possible and rightful place in the vanguard of the comity of nations, we must rekindle the spirit of unified action and resonance that was witnessed soon after independence. Resources are scarce and time is not on our side.\u000a\u000aOur energy security needs the highest priority for energy efficiency. The National Mission on Energy Efficiency with tradable efficiency certificates, accompanied by strong energy-labelling norms for generating equipment, appliances including automobiles, building codes and manufacturing processes should improve our existing impressive energy intensity.\u000a\u000aThe manpower requirements for the energy sector are colossal, besides the need to reorient and train the existing manpower to meet the needs of an information technology-enabled smart grid of the future. The existing technical manpower in the power sector is around 750,000. This needs to be increased by nearly 500,000 by the 12th Plan.\u000a\u000aThe attainment of energy security will require a milestone-based road map, with a green channel and minimum road blocks. Project management has to be much tighter, as well as ruthless. In the overall context, we need to replace inspectors with investors, deficiency with efficiency, and renovation with innovation.\u000a\u000aSecurity comes at a price.\u000a\u000aAnil Razdan is a former Union power secretary and also served in the petroleum ministry as additional and special secretary.\u000a\u000aRespond to this column at feedback@livemint.com

a((VNecessity was the mother of telecom sector invention in India. Rising capital expenditure and social & environmental resistance forced telecom operators to look at infrastructure sharing. Their need to cut operational costs and expand rapidly across geographies in the face of limited infrastructure availability and rising regulatory pressures aided the process.\u000a\u000aInfrastructure sharing practically started in 2005 with Quippo Telecom taking the lead and creating a demand for the concept in the market. Initially, when infrastructure sharing was not common, operators created and managed their own infrastructure, at huge costs. However, as the industry evolved, various cost benefits of infrastructure sharing came to the fore, prompting the players to adopt this concept.\u000a\u000aWith telecom tariffs going down at every turn, operators grappled with a sustained decline in their average revenue per user (Arpu). The global slowdown further impacted their investment plans, resulting in their quest for the innovative and cost-effective business model of infrastructure sharing.\u000a\u000aToday, almost 65-70% of an operators opex goes towards telecom infrastructure provisioning cost. According to various independent studies, a telecom operator offering wireless services can save up to 30% of capex and 15% of opex by sharing the telecom infrastructure.\u000a\u000aTelecom infrastructure sharing offers various cost and social benefits. Some of these include:\u000a\u000a* Benefits to end-consumers; from reduced costs for operators and the resultant lower cost of services. Infrastructure sharing also leads to increased availability of telecom services across wider geographies, further promoting competition and better services;\u000a\u000a* Benefits to new operators; to launch services rapidly across the length and breadth of the country through ready-infrastructure, and at much lower costs due to the reduction in their capital and operational expenditure. Reduced capex also releases cash that can be used for strategic corporate purposes;\u000a\u000a* Bridging the digital divide by helping the government achieve its objectives of increasing telecom penetration in rural India. Unless shared, the rollout of telecom services in rural India will be an unviable option for most operators;\u000a\u000a* Benefits to the environment by reducing the infrastructure requirements, like telecom towers, of operators. Infrastructure sharing also offers other benefits such as shared energy and maintenance bills, thus helping the operators, while benefitting the environment with reduced carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aWhile only passive infrastructure sharing is permitted in India, active infrastructure sharing is still under government consideration. Once allowed, these measures will further reduce costs for operators.\u000a\u000aIn the mature international markets, during various stages of growth, telecom operators adopted different forms of infrastructure sharing, namely site sharing, network sharing, intra-circle roaming, etc. These models facilitated speedy rollout and helped new entrants to significantly reduce time-to-market. As these markets matured, other forms of sharing also became relevant, such as spectrum sharing and MVNOs, which enhanced the sectors growth.\u000a\u000aToday, India is one of the largest and the fastest growing mobile markets in the world. An average addition of over 16-18 million new subscribers every month has put immense pressure on the existing telecom infrastructure. The launch of 3G and Wimax services will exert additional pressure on infrastructure, posing a challenge for operators to support this growth momentum. The astronomical bids seen during the 3G and BWA auctions have put a huge strain on the balance sheets of operators, and this strain can be eased by reducing their service and network rollout costs through infrastructure sharing.\u000a\u000aThese challenges offer a business opportunity to existing infrastructure companies. According to our estimates, the Indian market will see around 1.5-1.6 lakh additional tenancies with the launch of 3G and Wimax services. From less than 1.5 lakh towers in 2007, the industry today has grown to over 3.2 lakh towers. These facts highlight the growth potential the Indian market offers to telecom infrastructure companies.\u000a\u000aWhile the telecom infrastructure industry has seen tremendous growth in the last few years, it faces several challenges on its growth path. With the profitability of operators keep falling, managing telecom infrastructure-related capital and operating expenditure is becoming unmanageable. A high tenancy ratio is crucial for the viability of shared telecom infrastructure business, as higher the tenancy, the faster are the returns on investment. However, in a scenario where a large number of infrastructure players compete for enhanced market shares, getting higher tenancy becomes a key challenge.\u000a\u000aTelecom infrastructure sharing works on a business model that depends on multiple service providers rolling out their services simultaneously. Supporting the simultaneous rollout of new operators will need immediate investment in the network rollout programme. However, with the global financial meltdown, fund raising has become a difficult task for infrastructure players.\u000a\u000aWith rural India being the only bastion left for telecom operators, most of them are launching their services in these still-untapped markets. While a major chunk of new subscribers are coming from rural markets today, the falling Arpus have become a deterrent for the service providers to enter these geographies. Even if infrastructure players set up their sites in rural belts, recovering their costs by getting tenants remains a big challenge.\u000a\u000aThe telecom sector has played a vital role in the overall growth of the economy, amply supported by the innovative concept of infrastructure sharing. In todays extremely competitive market, the only way service providers can sustain their growth and profitability is through infrastructure sharing. This is the time they should focus all their energies on customer-centric initiatives, to create a differentiation in the marketplace to gain a competitive edge. In such a scenario, it is important for policy makers to come up with laws that are practical to be implemented at the grassroots level. Such policies should encourage infrastructure sharing among all operators.\u000a\u000aThe writer is CEO Quippo-WTTIL

Even bilateral agreements take time, but this multilateral system through Standard Material Transfer Agreement speeds up the pace of development,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWhile climate change discussions did not focus much on agriculture and the emphasis was on mitigation, the treaty had decided to lead a global initiative to help farmers to adapt key food crops to climate change.\u000a\u000aHailing the contributions of eminent scientist M.S.Swaminathan to agriculture, she said: \u201cProfessor Swaminathan has been a leading member of the international High-level Task Force of the Benefit Sharing Fund [BSF] of the treaty, which is charged with fund raising to support farmers in developing countries through the BSF. In the last 12 months, almost $15 million has been successfully raised for the BSF.

a((VRANCHI: Wanna impress your beloved? Organize an event on October 10 this year and become a climate campaigner . This appeal has been issued by 350.org, an international campaign against global warming and climate change.The campaign, which is running across 110 countries, aims at organizing 1100 events on 10/10/10 to draw attention of policy-makers across the world towards the catastrophe facing the world. Jamie Henn of the team, who is also the media in-charge, believes that the best way to express concern is to organize some activity on a particular day so that the relevant concern at the grass-roots level is reflected at the international panorama.The representative of the campaign in Jharkhand, Bulu Imam, says: "People often express concern over the erratic behaviour of the climate while sitting in their drawing room and watching television but when it comes to doing something for the climate, they find blaming others the easiest way out."Most of the people in India have experienced rising mercury in central parts of the country and unexpected rainfall in western ghats, predictions of the India Meteorological department IMD ) have gone haywire in terms of monsoon this year.350.org campaigners strongly feel that these changes are not specific about India but similar changes have been noticed in the global climate, still the policy-makers pay no heed to the situation.Suggesting few tips, the campaigners have asked every individual to choose some activities like figuring out how to cut emissions by 10% in 2010, planting trees, installing efficient light bulbs, and fixing up bikes. Then plan some entertainment programmes, a local band, some engaging speakers, or an art project like painting a mural about climate solutions."Finally invite a person who you are trying to impress but also be sure to invite your local politicians and tell them to get to work'," suggest the campaigners so as to motivate maximum youth for the purpose.350.org, an independent and non-profitable group founded by Bill McKeibben who rose to limelight by his first book on global warming The end of nature has members all over the world, most of whom have joined voluntarily. The campaigners aim at restricting environmental degradation due to human activities by bringing about changes at the level of policy-makers.Imam says that though environment is a global issue, people often make the mistake of interpreting it as "not a local issue". "Unless we all join hands together, exploiters of nature would continue with their trade and devise methods of paying money for irreparable damages caused to nature and we are not ready for that," he said.

a((VOne might call it the Second Korean War, except that its frontiers are all in the south, its weapons aren\u2019t guns and mortars, and its purpose isn\u2019t conquering territory but securing a nation\u2019s future. Its troops are all of South Korea\u2019s 50 million people. Its combat colours, green.\u000a\u000aFor a nation 97 per cent dependent on imported fossil fuel, the greening of its is a matter of life and death. Two years ago, on August 15, 2008, President announced a new vision for South Korea of \u201clow-carbon, green-growth\u201d long-term development, embracing everything from home to work to industry. In January 2009, responding to a deepening recession, the government unveiled a \u201cgreen growth\u201d five-year plan with a stimulus package of $38.1 billion, to be spent mostly on such green objectives as fresh water security, waste conversion, energy-efficient buildings, greater use of renewable energy, and development of low-carbon, high-mileage cars.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s clear that South Korea is saying goodbye to the grow-at-any-cost model of \u2014 the so-called \u201cbrown economy\u201d \u2014 and is embracing the \u201cgreen\u201d economic model, where sustainability is the key. With that in mind, the government is spending 2 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP annually to pursue its green agenda.\u000a\u000aSince the main purpose is to lessen the country\u2019s dependence on fuel imports and reduce carbon emission which has sharply increased in the last 15 years, developing renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency throughout the are the overwhelming priorities. Renewable energy contributed 2.7 per cent of the total energy supply in the country last year. The aim is to raise that share to 3.78 per cent by 2013, 6.08 per cent by 2020, and 11 per cent by 2030.\u000a\u000aThe strategy, naturally, is whatever it takes. There\u2019s the sun, of course. By 2012, the country\u2019s total installed solar capacity is to go up to 400 Mw from 168 Mw now. And there\u2019s the wind. Korean companies are now working on developing 5 Mw wind turbines to reach the goal of 7,300 Mw of wind power capacity by 2020, against some 200 Mw now. Also tides. Tidal power plants are already operating in Shiwa Lake and new ones are proposed for Incheon and Garorim bays. From virtually nothing in 2008, 5.2 per cent of all renewable energy generated in South Korea is to come from tidal power by 2020.\u000a\u000aAbove all, there\u2019s waste energy, already a big thing in South Korea, with 76 per cent of all its renewable energy derived from this source alone. In the immediate future, 25 landfill gas-collecting facilities are to be built all over the country, along with 48 new environmental energy plants and 17 facilities that will collect and reuse the remaining heat from incinerators.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, the country is going all out for energy saving and efficiency. Designing high-mileage automobile engines is just one part of this effort. Encouraging people to use public transport as often as they can is another. Public transport is likely to account for 55 per cent of all journeys In South Korea by 2013. The government is even building about 3,114 km of new bicycle lanes nationwide to encourage people to bike more.\u000a\u000aBy 2025, it will be mandatory for all buildings, private, commercial, or office, to use at least one of a range of energy alternatives. One million new green homes is the goal by 2020, based on solar, wind, geothermal, or biomass energy, while a million existing homes will be converted to greener ways. This is an important move, because, according to the Korean Institute of Construction Technology, buildings consume as much as 25 per cent of all energy consumed in the country.\u000a\u000aIn small, regional communities, 600 villages are to espouse low-carbon practices, while in eight areas around the country, 14 environment-friendly towns will be developed to emphasise green living. Green cities are the new trend in South Korea, the most famous being Songdo. Coming up entirely from scratch on 1,500 acres of reclaimed land along Incheon\u2019s waterfront, it will be the world\u2019s first \u201cubiquitous technology\u201d city, where everything from energy management at home to accessing public services will be technology-driven. A similar green city is coming up south of Seoul, where box hedges will be grown on terraces built around each floor of skyscrapers.\u000a\u000aAnd as the trenches are dug and troops deployed in South Korea\u2019s great green war, a non-profit Global Green Growth Institute was opened last June in Seoul to coordinate battle strategies at home and advise green warriors everywhere.\u000a\u000aWith Han Seung-soo, a former South Korean prime minister, and chairman and professors Thomas Heller of Stanford University and Nicholas Stern of London School of Economics as members, the institute will especially help develop technologies and policies for environmentally sustainable growth. \u201cGreen growth is our national vision,\u201d Han said at the opening ceremony and left no one in doubt that they are determined to transform that vision into reality.\u000a\u000arbarun@gmail.com

a((VNEW DELHI: The Times of India has always strived to keep issues on environment in focus, engaging its readers with burning topics and raging debates. In an initiative to bring science and issues surrounding climate change closer to the people, the group launched a compilation of essays on climate change on Thursday.`Climate Change, Society and Sustainable Development: Agenda for Action' was launched by agriculturalist M S Swaminathan at a ceremony hosted jointly by Times Foundation , supported by Times Group Books , and FICCI . The book encompasses 20 essays contributed by 20 authors and 10 co-authors. The essays have been listed under five main heads of `Impact and assessment issues', `Science, society and environmental education', `Financing market mechanism and food security issues', `Volunteering and CSR for a smart planet' and `Mitigation and adaptation strategies'."The book is highly comprehensive and deals with pertinent issues such as CSR and mitigation. Climate change largely affects poor nations and the poor in all nations. We also have to study and understand the societal impact of climate change and how it affects lives and livelihoods. Anticipatory mitigation measures are extremely important to take,'' said Swaminathan.Amit Mitra, secretary general, FICCI, also recommended the book for anyone who wanted to understand the politics, science and impact of climate change. "The book is remarkable, specially for the brilliant statistics with which it supports its claims. India is on the verge of market development and it is necessary to understand how to incorporate this with mitigation methods. We are importing technology from other countries but are they carbon-friendly. There has to be a collective fund for countries like India to help them in accessing mitigation measures,'' he said.UK High Commissioner to India, Sir Richard Stagg, who also attended the launch ceremony, said: "Developed countries have created the problem and should shoulder responsibility in reducing it. UK is doing a great deal but we are a small nation and might not be able to make much of an impact on a global scale. While the climate change discussions are being carried out at a political level, it is also necessary to address the underlying practical issues like encouraging forestation and technology transfer. India seems to underestimate its ability to contribute to technology though it has some of the best minds in the world.''

a((VThe record heat wave and nationwide blaze of forest fires that are engulfing Russia, one of the worlds coldest countries, have dramatically pitchforked climate change and its destructive potential back to the centre of international attention. With average temperatures soaring to a 130-year-besting 38 degrees Celsius, more than 50 deaths directly owed to the wildfires, smoke blanketing urban areas and halting transportation, and drought compelling export restrictions on wheat, Russias cup of woes are full to the brim.\u000a\u000aClimate change-induced disasters need no better apocalyptic advertisement than Moscow city, where face masks are out and suffocation is killing. The forest and peat bog fires have spread across 1.8 million acres of land, raging close to densely populated suburbs and rural communities. Climate sceptics, who have often dismissed the alarmism of environmentalists, do not even have the benefit of air to breathe and advocate their fuzzy science if they were to set foot in Russia now.\u000a\u000aWhile neglectful administration and lack of precautions in Russias moribund forest conservation system partly account for the calamity, there is hardly any doubt that exacerbating anthropogenic climate change generated extreme fluctuations in weather patterns and caused the tragedy in the first place. President Dmitry Medvedev said as much in a speech that what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past.\u000a\u000aHow did a country run by a national security hawk and a vigilant ex-spy, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, allow itself to become a prostrate victim of a climate change attack of such proportion Though the Kremlin is passing the buck to sloppy local governments and trying to absolve itself of blame for the forest fires, it bears the burden of making fundamental policy miscalculations about the severity of climate change as a problem and the links between green cover, economic growth, and responsibility to curb carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aLast December, Russia came to the negotiating table at the Copenhagen summit with the typical lackadaisical position of top polluting industrialised countries that climate change was not a high national priority, and that the contribution of Russias vast forest cover to reducing global carbon dioxide concentration must be counted before determining its emissions ceiling. Putins grouse against the Kyoto Protocol was that it underestimated the capacity of Russias forests to absorb greenhouse gases, thereby placing a heavier green adaptation burden on its industries than was merited. Essentially, he disputed figures about Russias carbon footprint to chicken out of significant emission cut commitments, which were deemed too costly for an economy undergoing sharp convulsions of the global financial crisis.\u000a\u000aBut it turns out in hindsight that by shielding Russian heavy industry, especially the wantonly polluting state-owned energy sector, Putin helped add to the already dangerous pollution levels that engendered the current heat wave. It is supremely ironic that the same forests that Russia proudly displayed to escape carbon emission cuts are now being devastated by climate changes demons. Even worse, ecologists told RIA Novosti that the ongoing Russian fires will speed up global warming since burnt forests can release more carbon dioxide than they absorb for up to 30 years.\u000a\u000aRussia is not unique in positing a zero-sum game between shifting to greener technologies and economic growth, but its present predicament illustrates the falsity of such antinomies. The main reasoning behind Russias unwillingness to commit deeply to cleaning up its industries is that it would entail higher costs of production and render Russian products less competitive in world markets.\u000a\u000aBut what about the economic costs of unmitigated climate change For Russia, these are visible and not confined to imaginative oracles of pessimistic climatologists. The BBC has collected opinions of economists in Russia to the effect that the current heat wave and wildfires will cut $15 billion from economic output, especially by hampering agricultural output and exports. This climate change-propelled shock is expected to slow down Russias recovery from the depths of the global economic crisis.\u000a\u000aThere is a vicious cycle in which Russia, and many other prime polluting countries, have boxed themselves in. They avoid reducing the carbon intensity of their industries out of fear for its economic fallout on development, but end up paying dearly through their own pockets for ecological mishaps.\u000a\u000aChina, the worlds number one carbon emitter in absolute terms, is realising belatedly that it too has fallen into this trap. In February, it released excerpts of its first ever environmental census, acknowledging that water pollution in the country was twice as bad as had been hitherto stated. This weeks emergency measures announced in Beijing to shut down 2,087 steel mills, cement plants, paper and leather works for gross energy inefficiency come on the heels of new government studies pointing to a losing battle to preserve air quality in urban settings. For once, the costs of clean-ups and healthcare related to pollution and environmental accidents outweighed the benefits of keeping these selected smoke-happy factories open.\u000a\u000aBut do world leaders and publics, which opinion polls suggest to have downgraded climate change as a concern due to the pressing exigencies of joblessness and wobbly economic forecasts, need rude jolts like Russian wildfires to wake up and arrest the slide in the environment\u000a\u000aThe Christian Science Monitor reports that the forest fire epidemic has forced the long-prevaricating Kremlin to abruptly embrace climate change. One hopes that other states convert quickly to play a positive role at the year-end Cancun climate change summit without first subjecting their own societies to ecological horrors like the one scalding Russia.\u000a\u000aThe author is associate professor of world politics at the OP Jindal Global University

Photo: M.A.Sriram\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aThe roads of Bangalore are like huge funnels narrowing to impenetrable bottlenecks.\u000a\u000aLakhs of us have to endure daily congestion, our misery compounded by the toxic cocktail of automobile exhaust as we inch along through traffic jams.\u000a\u000aSo, would a cycling lane splitting and further reducing precious road space, be a solution to the traffic woes of the city? At least this was what was suggested by Transport Secretary M.K. Shankaralinge Gowda to the civic authorities at the recent Breathe Easy campaign. Mr. Gowda had urged laying of bicycle tracks on arterial roads to reduce congestion.\u000a\u000aMore than just words\u000a\u000aA laudable idea on all counts, but is it feasible? A dipstick survey by The Hindu suggested that a lot more would be required for the able and willing to be pedalling about in earnest.\u000a\u000aIt takes a lot for the city to put in place safe cycling tracks. As Khalandar Khan, Transport Planner in the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) explained: \u201cThe roads should be a minimum 30 metres wide for cycling tracks to be feasible. However, in Bangalore the terrain is highly inconsistent: the width keeps fluctuating from 30 metres to 10 metres. Hence, cycling tracks simply cannot be planned. If, however the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike's plan to widen 216 roads is achieved, then planning the tracks will be hassle free.\u201d\u000a\u000aStudy\u000a\u000aHe added that the Riders Cycle Foundation is conducting an extensive study, earmarking cycle-friendly zones. The Bangalore Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA) is awaiting the report.\u000a\u000aBig plans but\u2026\u000a\u000aBhaskara Rao, Commissioner for Transport and Road Safety and president of Riders Cycle Foundation said: \u201cWe're currently planning close to 300 km of cycle tracks. I would, however, be happy if I see five km of tracks take shape.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite a fairly decent public transport system, a big chunk of commuters still prefer their personal vehicles, he said, pointing out that 70 per cent of the 40 lakh registered vehicles here are two-wheelers. Mr. Rao observed that in Western Europe, where cycling is a prime mode of transport, there is a direct correlation between cycling and use of public road transport.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe higher the number of cyclists, the greater the population travelling by bus or the metro,\u201d he said, adding that Bangalore seems to buck the trend.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a city like Bangalore,\u201d said Pradeep Singh, a Ph.D. scholar in Transportation Management in IIT Delhi, \u201cthe speed distribution of traffic is highly variable, making it very unsafe for cyclists.\u201d\u000a\u000aIngrained in the culture\u000a\u000aHe pointed out that nowhere else in the world is bicycling so ingrained in the culture as it is in Holland.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Dutch Bicycling Council, 37 per cent of all the vehicle trips around Amsterdam are made on cycles.\u000a\u000aHolland's example\u000a\u000aAccording to a research article by John Puecher and Ralph Bueler, titled At the Frontiers of Cycling: Policy Innovations in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, Amsterdam has automobile-free zones, compelling people to use their cycles.\u000a\u000aDutch traffic laws protect young cyclists and hold automobile drivers responsible in case of accidents.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, fee for car parks has substantially increased since the 1970s.\u000a\u000aIt is high time that Bangalore, where cycles are destined to rust in garages once young adults move up in life, went \u2018Dutch'.\u000a\u000aGiving it that push\u000a\u000aWhy we should promote cycling\u000a\u000aIt reduces congestion. Six bicycles can typically fit into the road space of one car.\u000a\u000aIt does not emit climate-disrupting air pollution.\u000a\u000aIt is priced within the reach of thousands who cannot afford a car.\u000a\u000aCycling reduces obesity, a growing health problem.\u000a\u000aWhy cycling is difficult in Bangalore\u000a\u000aLack of basic infrastructure, such as specialised parking lots, tunnels and exclusive traffic signals.\u000a\u000aIt has ceased to be a part of the city's culture. Only 2 per cent of the population are registered cyclists.\u000a\u000aConstructing cycling lanes with grills around the periphery would only eat into the already strained road space.\u000a\u000aHow we can encourage cycling\u000a\u000aBy earmarking motor vehicle-free zones across the city.\u000a\u000aThere should be by ample cycle parking, full integration with public transport, comprehensive traffic education and training of both cyclists and motorists.\u000a\u000aBy making driving expensive as well as inconvenient in central and highly congested areas through a host of taxes and restrictions on car ownership, use and parking.

a((VPANAJI: The energy emission released by the mining industry over its lifespan in Goa has been equal to "210 Hiroshima-sized bombs," said an energy expert on Saturday.Speaking at a press conference after a workshop on Carbon Footprint , Sagar Dhar, a consultant to the United Nations and a member on several government committees, said the damage to Goa has been done over several decades by the mining industry."The mining area for iron ore in Goa is 700 square km. The carbon footprint released by mining is computed at 15 tera joules per square km. That means the total energy released by mining has been 10,500 tera joules, which is equal to 210 Hiroshima-sized bombs," said Dhar. (The WWII atom bomb was codenamed Little Boy)."The energy released by one Hiroshima-sized bomb was calculated at 50 tera joules," he added. The day-long workshop in Panaji was attended by 65 participants including various social activist groups and students. Participants were taught how to compute carbon footprints and the results were later used for an analysis.The participants also computed the carbon footprint created by the tourism industry. The carbon dioxide emissions for foreign tourists was calculated at 1.3 metric tonnes (MT), while emissions for Indian tourists was calculated at 0.26 MT. The overall emission for tourism in Goa is 1.5 MT, Dhar said.To sequester these emissions, forest area is required and the current forest availability in Goa falls short of the requirement, he claimed.

a((VCHENNAI: As a young boy, Robert Swan dreamt of going to the last great wilderness on earth. A place not owned by anyone but belonging to all. By the age of 33, he realised this dream, becoming the first person to walk to both the south and north poles. Since then, the polar explorer and environmentalist has been touring the world, raising awareness about the need to preserve Antarctica and promoting renewable energy use to combat climate change."In 2041, the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty could be modified or amended," says Swan, who is in the city to give a series of talks. His mission is to inspire young people across the world, so that "when they are leading the world in 2041, they will ensure that Antarctica will continue to be protected."It was a film about Antarctica that inspired Swan, then a 11-year-old, to travel there. In 1979, after finishing university, he began raising money for his travel. "I had to buy a ship and other materials to construct my home there," says Swan. In 1986, he sailed to Antarctica and began his walk to the south pole.The 1,600 km walk took Swan and his team 70 days. "We walked nine hours a day, seven days a week, pulling 180 kg on a sledge," says Swan. "Our eyes hurt, faces burned, and skin peeled. Later, we realised that it happened while we walked under a hole in the ozone layer," says Swan, who has received an OBE and Polar medal from the queen of England In 1989, he walked to north pole. "As we were walking across the frozen seas, 1,000 km from land, ice caps started melting four months before they were supposed to," says Swan. "We were witnessing first-hand the effects of climate change and global warming."The two experiences, and the request of his patron, environmentalist Jacques Cousteau, inspired Swan to start 2041'. "I concentrate on reaching out to young people," says Swan, who takes young businessmen, women and journalists to see the impact of climate change on Antarctica."It's time for India and China to avoid the mistakes the developed world made with the use and abuse of energy," says Swan. "India can become the workshop of the world to create new clean technology," he says.Swan, who has already toured Hyderabad, New Delhi and Kolkota, will be back in India in January 2011. "I plan to identify a local environmental project, where I can involve people, just to show them you can achieve something," says Swan, who will be also bringing along 2041', the sailboat on which he has gone round the world on his Voyage for Cleaner Energy'. "I'll speak to schools, businesses and also identify someone whom I can take on my next trip to Antarctica," says Swan.

a((VUpdated: Mon, Aug 16 2010. 08 28 PM IST\u000a\u000aHappily, we are meeting our energy requirements at prices that are reasonable in the context of global prices. A recent government decision dismantling the administered pricing regime for gas is welcome from the market perspective. The long-term energy security scenario, however, would call for focused attention. India aspires to be among the top three economies in the not-too-distant future and that will require a substantial increase in the consumption of petroleum products. The International Energy Agency estimates India\u2019s crude oil consumption to be growing at a rate of 3.9% per annum up to 2030\u2014the highest in the world, compared with China\u2019s 3.5% and the world\u2019s 1%. While our dependence on imported crude oil will go up from 80% to 92% by 2030, India\u2019s domestic production is estimated to fall from 0.75 million barrels per day (mbpd) to 0.3 mbpd by 2030.\u000a\u000aIn this context, there is need for some introspection on the role of exploration and production (E&P) firms in the public and the private sectors. Exploration is an extremely risky enterprise and risk-taking needs to be incentivized by all means through an imaginative policy regime. At the same time, how would we meet increasing demand for oil at the prices which are in the offing? Global oil reserves are estimated to be sufficient only for the next 30 years. Global production has to go up by six times Saudi Arabia\u2019s or six times Russia\u2019s to meet world oil demand by 2030. But the investment trends in E&P don\u2019t hold much promise that this will happen. In such a scenario of demand-supply imbalance, prices are bound to shoot up. And that will have devastating effects on the country\u2019s economy at the macro level by way of raising the import bill, which is around 7% of gross domestic product, and at the micro level in the form of high retail prices.\u000a\u000aThe doctor advises diversification from oil and fat to fruits and vegetables to prevent clogging of arteries. Crude oil consumption, the way it is growing, may affect the arteries of the economy at prices beyond $100 (Rs4,680) per barrel. We must, therefore, diversify the energy basket to reduce the consumption of crude oil and switch to substitutes, namely natural gas, biofuels, and other non-conventional forms of energy; improve efficiency of energy use; and accelerate domestic E&P efforts. Otherwise the energy crunch and high crude prices may put a question mark on our cherished economic prosperity.\u000a\u000aPricing petroleum products\u000a\u000aDecontrolling prices is a tough call for the government, but the recent decisions are appropriate. Kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and diesel continue to be heavily subsidized while petrol price has been decontrolled. In the prevailing socioeconomic context, it is necessary to balance the interests of the oil marketing companies, the upstream companies, the state exchequer and consumers.\u000a\u000aThe most important element in product prices is the level of taxation, which is high and varies from state to state, up to 50% for petrol and around 35% for diesel. More importantly, the taxes are levied on an ad valorem basis although petroleum prices are highly volatile. The state governments benefit disproportionately at the cost of the consumers when oil prices rise. There is a need to look into the entire taxation structure and replace the ad valorem rates with specific rates. With efforts under way to put in place a goods and services tax, let us hope that a way forward is found in respect of the taxation regime.\u000a\u000aR.S.

a((VUpdated: Mon, Aug 16 2010. 08 47 PM IST\u000a\u000aWhen I recently wrote that we need to invest more aggressively in alternative energy, in the light of the oil spill at the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico, I promptly got a number of emails from readers, including a series of searching questions from Dan Lubar of Colorado.\u000a\u000aFirst, Lubar is concerned about the cost, both in time and resources, of transforming our energy infrastructure to provide enough alternative energy to meet our needs. \u201cVarious transitions that are under way will take time and may in fact cost many times more than our current energy economy can bear during a long transition period, \u201d he cautions.\u000a\u000aWhile I believe biofuels and biomass are two suitable energy sources to replace petroleum-based fuels, Lubar worries that these are the wrong choices. He asks whether we can really afford to build a second \u201cfuel system\u201d alongside the first and transition away from unsustainable fossil fuels. He suggests that the two best bets are fusion and geothermal energy.\u000a\u000aLubar also wonders what roles the private sector and the government should play in the switch\u2014and whether this kind of transition to alternative energy is even possible, in the long run. Given the disparity between demand and supply, there can be no doubt that the world is facing a monumental decision. One hurdle is that infrastructure costs more to build today than it did 40 or 50 years ago. For instance, a new coal plant in the US costs around $4 million (Rs18.72 crore) per megawatt to build today, compared with just $1 million per megawatt 30 years ago.\u000a\u000aBut it is not quite correct that a whole second fuel system has to be built alongside the existing one. Many biofuels being developed now, such as alcohol fuels, can be blended with the current fuel offerings; others, called drop-in fuels, can simply be substituted for existing fuels. With either of those options, we can continue to use existing transportation and refuelling infrastructures, making only minor modifications over time.\u000a\u000aThe increasing cost of infrastructure is mainly due to rising energy costs, which make it more expensive to produce cement, steel and other building materials. By comparison, the incremental costs of the changes I favour are quite small. As the oil industry performs routine maintenance, it can absorb the minor costs of updating its infrastructure to accommodate certain newer fuels. And in the case of drop-in fuels, no changes are necessary.\u000a\u000aI would also caution Lubar and others to be careful about picking \u201cwinners\u201d in this debate. As an entrepreneur I have often found that it is precisely when entrenched interests refuse to change that I have had an opportunity to make money by doing things differently. While I\u2019m a big proponent of both nuclear and geothermal energy, these technologies are generally the domain of entrenched interests, and those interests push them very hard. The solar, wind, biomass and energy-efficiency sectors are generally led by entrepreneurs\u2014which is why they have been so successful in the past 10 years, raising more than $150 billion in project finance this year alone.\u000a\u000aThe big global successes of the past 30 years, such as the mobile phone and the Internet, have been what the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter described as \u201cdestructive successes\u201d. The mobile phone has eclipsed the 100-year-old landline and put traditional telecom companies out of business in many markets. The Internet has revolutionized some marketing, advertising and content companies, while forcing others into dire straits. The same will happen in infrastructure. The time frames we\u2019re talking about are relatively short: In just 10 years, the solar and wind industries have gone from virtually a standing start to amassing $150 billion a year in financing. In the energy transition, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial chief executive officers will lead the way.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, oil cost $20-30 per barrel. Today the oil industry says it has to charge closer to $40 per barrel just to break even, and the cost of oil has already reached more than $80 a barrel following the Deepwater spill.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, almost 10% of the petrol in the US now comes from ethanol and, by law, all petrol sold in Brazil must contain 20-25% of the fuel. Next-generation biofuels promise cost-effective production within three years. Even if that turns out to be five years, if the price of oil continues to climb, it may become much more profitable for oil-importing countries such as Jamaica to grow crops such as sweet sorghum to create its own biofuel, instead of purchasing fossil fuels overseas.\u000a\u000aWhy are people so reluctant to see the changes going on around them? Maybe this is why entrepreneurs are courted the world over: they see change coming before the mass market does, and in the process they\u2019re able to create wealth for themselves and their supporters. Harnessing this talent will help us develop timely and cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure and transform the world\u2019s energy supply.\u000a\u000aBy nyt syndicate\u000a\u000a©2010/Richard Branson\u000a\u000aRichard Branson is the founder of the Virgin Group and companies such as Virgin Atlantic, Virgin America, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Active.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAn Australian expert has said that the churning of the Earth\u2019s molten interior may have played a vital role in sea level change over the past two to 20 million years.\u000a\u000aGeophysicist Dietmar Muller from University of Sydney said that the levels vary because of natural processes on Earth on timescales from thousands to hundreds of millions of years. In the past they have been more than 120 metres higher than present day levels.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe reality is we live on a dynamic planet -- even in the absence of human-induced warming, sea levels would still change dramatically because it\u2019s been doing it for a very long time,\u201d ABC Science quoted Muller as saying. \u201cThis paper points this out, controlling and taming the planet is to some extent a futile exercise.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you want to develop intelligent responses [to climate change] we need to identify our own contributions to sea level change from natural fluctuations,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWhile the causes of long and very short term (less than 2 million years) changes in sea level are well understood, Muller suggested there are also cycles of change on intermediate timescales of between 2 and 20 million years. Another research led by Kenni Petersen from Aarhus University has also shown sea levels may change at a regional scale due to heat from below the Earth\u2019s crust forcing sea floors to rise.\u000a\u000aProfessor Kurt Lambeck of Australian National University said Petersen\u2019s research is \u201clikely to be an important part of our understanding of long-term sea level change\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut he said these sorts of changes are of \u201cno consequence on the human timescale.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the rate of change, which is now several millimetres per year, several orders of magnitude more than in has been in the past,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe findings were published in the journal Science.

Strategist Mao Zedong had repeatedly stated his objective about that territory: "There are two winds in the world, the east wind and west wind...I think the characteristic of the current situation is that the east wind prevails over the west wind; that is, the strength of socialism exceeds the strength of imperialism."These words were pronounced in 1957, but by 1950 there had been no question that China would not allow the west wind prevail as China's People's Liberation Army set out to 'liberate' the roof of the world. Mao knew that he who holds Tibet dominates the Himalayan piedmont and, thereby, the Asian water towers. The government of India, having inherited past treaties signed by the British with Tibet, should have gained an advantage over control of these water towers. But India failed to do so and gave no serious thought to the consequences.The Indians were not only shocked at China's unprovoked military action in Tibet, they were also offended by how the Chinese government had disregarded its explicit assurances to India that Tibet would be left alone. In a sharp note to the Chinese government, the Indian foreign ministry expressed deep regret and surprise at the decision to send troops into Tibet just after the Tibetans had initiated negotiations with China's ambassador in New Delhi. The US and British governments expressed their support for the Indian position, and the US state department informed New Delhi of its desire to help Tibet by whatever means possible.The Americans recognised that, in view of geographic and historical factors, India's cooperation was needed in any attempt to effectively help Tibet. But India's foreign ministry dissuaded the US from supplying military aid to Tibet. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru even requested that Washington refrain from publicly condemning China. India's attitude of washing its hand of Tibet deeply hurt and humiliated the Tibetan people and put India at a permanent disadvantage.Tibet's strategic position has become obvious in recent years: scientists and policymakers have begun to recognise how climate change has the potential to reduce snowpack and glacier mass in the Tibetan plateau, altering one of the world's most crucial hydrological systems. Thanks to its control over Tibet, China can claim sovereign right to control the world's largest freshwater resources outside the polar regions. These water resources, vulnerable to global and regional warming, are critical for sustaining South Asia's food and water security. Should China be the lone arbiter of the fate of Tibet's waters? What happens to downstream nations that depend heavily on these rivers?China possesses a robust glaciological programme and knows fairly well how long Tibet's snow and ice resources will last. It has embarked on integrated water resource management of all rivers emanating from Tibetan plateau. And it has completed dam construction and water diversion projects on the Salween and Mekong rivers, despite regional and global criticism that these will be socially and economically devastating downstream.China plans to build 59 reservoirs on rivers flowing out of the Tibetan plateau to save glacier run-off. Construction is in full swing at Zangmu for a 540 MW run of the river power project and feasibility studies have been completed for five more such projects further upstream on the Yarlung Tsangpo. Tapping the power of the river Tsangpo (Brahmaputra for Indians) as it bends and plunges down towards Indian and Bangladeshi floodplains has long been a dream of Chinese politicians and hydro-engineers. Metog will be the site of the mega project at the huge bend inside a giant canyon approximately 3.1 miles deep and 198 miles long. This will involve construction of a series of tunnels, pipes, reservoirs and turbines that will generate 40,000 MW of power and exploit the spectacular 2,000-metre fall of the river as it winds down towards India.This water diversion project an essential part of China's 10th five-year plan will cost $62 billion. The entire staff responsible for constructing the Lhasa-Beijing railway line has been assigned to executing this mega project quickly. The project is ominous for millions of Indians and Bangladeshis. Chinese conservationists have admitted that the canyon is home to more than 60 per cent of the Tibetan plateau's biological resources and many indigenous communities. Yet China officially denies it is constructing any reservoirs or dams on the Brahmaputra. Surprisingly, India accepts these official denials (an attitude much like Nehru's in 1950 prior to Tibet's annexation).China has emerged as the world's second largest economy and a formidable military and nuclear power. Accordingly, the world's great powers treat it with respect and caution. Control over Tibet's water resources in a world that is warming has provided it with strategic edge over its neighbours. India should recalibrate its Tibet policy and start negotiating a legally binding international treaty on the Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers. As of now, both countries have no legal and policy architecture in place to deal with a looming water dispute. They only have a couple of MoUs in sharing flood-season hydrological data on these rivers. This, despite the fact China has already started exploiting Tibetan rivers for their strategic advantage.

New ways to raise food production will also be needed, say scientists. Conventional animal breeding should be able to meet much of the anticipated demand for dairy and meat products but this may not be enough.\u000a\u000aMany low-tech ways are considered to effectively increase yields, such as reducing the 30-40% food waste that occurs both in rich and poor countries.\u000a\u000aOther studies suggest a radical rethink of global food production is needed to reduce dependence on oil.

We need to look at these review conferences as how much progress we have made,\u201d she said in an interview with The Hindu here on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aWorld leaders will be welcome, but are not courted. A lot of effort is going into ensuring that the negotiations are transparent and inclusive, and are seen to be so.\u000a\u000aWhile many rich countries have been demanding a new treaty \u2014 which would replace the Kyoto Protocol with one that waters down the obligations of the industrialised world and slaps emission targets on large developing countries like India and China \u2014 Mexico is taking a pragmatic stance.\u000a\u000aMs. Espinosa's view that the Kyoto Protocol is not expiring, that we need a \u201ccontinuity of the regime\u201d and that \u201cthe existing legal framework is a good basis\u201d would enthuse Indian hearts. \u201cThere is no need for a new treaty,\u201d she said.But she also added, \u201cNot at this point. Of course, any treaty can be improved.\u201d\u000a\u000aEarlier, speaking to the Indian business community, she said. \u201cIf only developed countries act, this is not enough to face the challenges of climate change \u2026We must be realistic about that.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen Fund\u000a\u000aThis pragmatism extends to the financing aspect. Mexico initially suggested that the Green Fund be funded by all countries, including the developing countries, in a bid to change the \u201crecipient-donor\u201d attitude of climate finance.\u000a\u000aThat proposal got discarded, but Ms. Espinosa made it clear that taxpayers in rich countries could not be expected to shoulder the entire burden. \u201cIt would be very difficult to say that only public money will be used,\u201d she said, referring to the $100 billion per year till 2020 that has been agreed to. \u201cWe are considering ways to encourage the increased participation of the private sector.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmaller projects\u000a\u000aMexico is also suggesting proposals to make the Clean Development Mechanism \u2014 which allows rich nations to fund climate-friendly projects in poor nations in return for emissions credits \u2014 more agile and less bureaucratic to encourage smaller projects in smaller nations. Next month, it also hopes to launch a website www.faststartfinance.org, which will track what is actually happening to the $30 billion that was promised as short-term financing.\u000a\u000aMeets Manmohan\u000a\u000aMs. Espinosa met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, telling them that \u201can ambitious outcome [at Cancun] requires India's sustained political guidance and support.\u201d

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aCountries face a collapse of their economies and loss of culture if they do not protect the environment better, the world\u2019s leading champion of nature has warned.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we are seeing today is a total disaster,\u201d said Ahmed Djoghlaf, the secretary-general of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. \u201cNo country has met its targets to protect nature. We are losing biodiversity at an unprecedented rate. If current levels [of destruction] go on we will reach a tipping point very soon. The future of the planet now depends on governments taking action in the next few years.\u201d Industrialisation, population growth, the spread of cities and farms, and climate change are all now threatening the fundamentals of life itself, said Djoghlaf, in London before a UN meeting in which governments are expected to sign up to a more ambitious deal to protect nature.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany plans were developed in the 1990s to protect biodiversity but they are still sitting on the shelves of ministries. Countries were legally obliged to act, but only 140 have even submitted plans and only 16 have revised their plans since 1993. Governments must now put their houses in order,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the UN Environment Programme, the Earth is in the middle of a mass extinction of life. Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cbackground\u201d rate and, claim many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the dinosaurs vanished nearly 65m years ago. Around 15% of mammal species and 11 per cent of bird species are classified as threatened with extinction.\u000a\u000aDjoghlaf warned Britain and other countries not to cut nature protection amid the recession. In a reference to expected 40 per cent cuts in Britain\u2019s Department of the Environment spending, he said, \u201cYou may well save a few pounds now but you will lose billions later. Biodiversity is your natural asset. The more you lose it, the more you lose your cultural assets too.\u201d Djoghlaf said, 300 million people who depended on forests and the more than 1 billion who lived off sea fishing were in immediate danger. \u201cCut your forests down, or over-fish, and these people will not survive. Destroying biodiversity only increases economic insecurity. The more you lose it, the more you lose the chance to grow.\u201d He added, \u201cThe loss of biodiversity compounds poverty. Biodiversity is fundamental to social life, education and aesthetics. It\u2019s a human right to live in a healthy environment.\u201d Djoghlaf criticised countries for separating action on climate change from protecting biodiversity. \u201cThe loss of biodiversity exacerbates climate change. But it is handled by the poorest ministries in government, it has not been mainstreamed or prioritised by governments. Climate change cannot be solved without action on biodiversity, and vice versa.\u201d The UN chief said that children were losing contact with nature. \u201cIn Algeria, children are growing up who have never seen olive trees. How can you protect nature if you do not know it?\u201d A UN report on the impact of biodiversity loss, out in October, is expected to say that the economic case for global action to stop species destruction is even more powerful than the argument for tackling climate change. It will say that saving biodiversity is cost-effective and the benefits from saving \u201cnatural goods and services\u201d, such as pollination, medicines, fertile soils, clean air and water, are between 10 and 100 times the cost of saving the habitats and species that provide them.\u000a\u000aCopyright: Guardian News & Media 2010

In addition, increased warming will also result in a reduced level of snowfall, but more rain.\u000a\u000aBecause rain doesn't reflect heat back the way snow does, this will enhance the melting of the Antarctic sea ice from above. \u201cWe may see, on a time scale of decades, a switch in the Antarctic, where the sea ice extent begins to decrease,\u201d said Judith A.

a((VUpdated: Wed, Aug 18 2010. 09 54 PM IST\u000a\u000aIn the summer of 2010, the Supreme Court delivered its voluminous judgement in the well-publicized litigation between Reliance Industries Ltd and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. Its implications are far-reaching.\u000a\u000aThe learned judges held in no uncertain terms that the Union of India had a fiduciary responsibility to manage the mineral resources for and on behalf of its people. In the backdrop of this profound judgement reside the challenges and constraints of the coal sector in India\u2014sheltered, protected; an anomaly in a mostly market-based economy.\u000a\u000aThe government has been controlling this sector with the initial objective of ensuring availability of coal at affordable prices. Historically, coal has been the most abundant and commonly used energy resource across the world. In India, it accounts for 52% of the country\u2019s primary commercial energy basket. The power sector is the single largest consumer of coal; 53% of India\u2019s installed power generation capacity is coal-based and it accounts for about three-fourths of the total coal consumed in India annually.\u000a\u000aIndia is bestowed with abundant coal reserves, estimated at an enormous 267 billion tonnes (of which the proven coal reserves are placed at 106 billion tonnes). The proven coal resources of India account for nearly 7.1% of the world\u2019s proven coal reserves.\u000a\u000aThe coal sector in India is highly regulated. Until 1993, coal mining remained predominantly nationalized. Since mid-1993, private sector companies have been allowed to mine coal, albeit for captive consumption for end uses such as power generation and iron and steel production. Even today, state-owned miners account for about 95% of the 500 million tonnes (mt) of coal production.\u000a\u000aIndia is emerging as a modern economy, targeting 9-10% annual growth. Realizing the underlying growth potential will largely depend on our ability to meet energy requirements. Power is a sector whose growth targets inter alia depend on coal. The Integrated Energy Policy framed by the government estimates the installed generation capacity requirement at 778Gw and energy requirement at 3,880 billion kWh by 2031-32, if the gross domestic product grows at a rate of 8%. At a 9% growth rate, the capacity requirement will be 960Gw and energy requirement will be 4,806 billion kWh. In the light of these projections, coal demand is estimated to rise threefold from 500 mt by the end of 11th Plan (2011-12) to 1.5 billion tonnes by the end of the 15th Plan (2031-32).\u000a\u000aGrowth in the coal sector has historically not been commensurate with the country\u2019s requirements. Peak power shortages have been as high as 14% and, energy shortages, 11-12%. Coal India Ltd has delivered growth of 5% or less, which is half the desired economic growth rate. The coal sector is constrained by supply limitations, inadequate drilling capacity, absence of a progressive regulatory framework, minimal private participation, high turnaround time and long gestation periods in getting clearances for mining projects. There is a need to attract investments in making available dedicated cargo vessels and modern and exclusive deep-sea coal terminals. In addition, the sector has to embark on a phase of climate change related research and development and incorporate clean technologies.\u000a\u000aThe long-term growth of the coal sector requires a confident and renewed mindset in developing coal resources through decontrol of the coal sector, listing of Coal India on the capital markets, establishment of an independent regulator and a level playing competitive environment, which supplements the framework of the holistic energy and infrastructure sector in India.\u000a\u000aGokul Chaudhri is a partner at audit and consulting firm BMR Advisors.\u000a\u000aRespond to this column at feedback@livemint.com

a((VWhat is biomass gasification?\u000a\u000aVillage electrification\u000a\u000aIndia has over 580,000 villages and many hamlets. In over 18,000 villages and hamlets grid electricity is to be provided. Even in villages where the state electricity grid is available, quality of power is poor, both in terms of voltage and duration of availability. The Government of India ( Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ) has introduced several schemes and financial incentives for electrifying these villages through renewable sources. Biomass gasification is one of the routes for tapping renewable sources of energy.Biomass is a naturally available substance from plants which store solar energy by the process of photosynthesis. It has been the major source of energy before discovery of fossil fuels and still is a source for cooking, and to some extent for industrial purposes in developing countries.Gasification is the process of converting biomass, which is largely available in the form of solid, to gaseous form through thermo chemical process. Biomass contains carbon and hydrogen, which on burning produces carbon dioxide and water vapour. These products, when passed over hot carbon bed (charcoal), are converted to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be burnt as other gaseous fuels.The technology for biomass gasification is reasonably matured and can be utilised for electrification of villages. There are several advantages of this route for village electrification. Some of them are listed below:Biomass is available almost everywhere or can be grown. The fuel can be locally collected.Power will be available on demand at any time of the day or year. The device can be used for 24 hours continuously or for limited period per day. Different capacities from a few k ilowatts to Megawatt scale gasifiers are available. The power generated can be used for multiple applications like lighting, drinking and irrigation water supply, small scale industries, etc. Since the device can be used at any time of the day, service can be conveniently sequenced. The investment costs are not very high.Production cost of power from gasifier systems range from 2.5 /kWh to 5 /kWh depending on capacity utilisation, biomass cost etc. The challenges of biomass based electricity include availability of entrepreneurs/ trained manpower to run such systems, managing the operation, maintenance and trouble-shooting, non availability of personnel for servicing and spares, distribution of electricity in case of micro grids, tariff setting, billing and collection, cost-benefits (given the regime of subsidised tariff from grid), etc.

Nearly 38,000 trees have been planted through the website in the last two months.\u000a\u000aPradip Shah, founder of CRISIL and Grow-Trees, came up with the idea after receiving a similar gift from Israeli clients. Says Paresh Murudkar, the in-charge of the initiative, \u201cThey gifted him a garden of 100 trees. That was when he thought of starting a similar project in India.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo plant a tree, you need to log on to the website, enter the number of trees, and state the purpose. Options range from wildlife (benefits local animals), rural (benefits rural communities) and forest (to prevent loss of tree cover). Enter your payment mode, choose between a gift and offset certificate, and you\u2019re good to go. There are no restrictions on the amount of trees you can plant.\u000a\u000aPurposeful planting\u000a\u000aGrow-Trees contacts their planting partners and plants trees depending on the purpose. \u201cWe only plant trees on government and community land and not on private land. This way, no one owns the trees and wildlife and local communities can reap the benefits of their produce,\u201d says Murudkar. The trees are mostly planted in the monsoon to give them a better survival rate. They also have a target set for each area. Once that is completed, they move on to new locations.\u000a\u000aGrow-Trees currently has ongoing projects in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Orissa and Kanha in Madhya Pradesh. They are also on the lookout for planning partners in Mumbai and Maharashtra.\u000a\u000aProjects undertaken\u000a\u000aKumbhalgarh Sanctuary, Rajasthan: Planting 50,000 trees to prevent deforestation.\u000a\u000aRajasthan: Planted 66,000 trees.\u000a\u000aKanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh: Helping wildlife by planting 50,000 trees.\u000a\u000aDahod, Gujarat: This is a 13,500-tree project. The community here will nurture a forest so that it provides fruit, fodder and fuel every year.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aWhen William \u2018Willie\u2019 Sutton \u2013 a prolific US bank robber, who during his forty year criminal career had stolen an estimated $2 million, and eventually spent more than half his adult life in prison \u2013 was asked why he robbed banks, his simple response was: \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\u000a\u000aOpening a chapter with this quote, Peter Senge writes in \u2018The Necessary Revolution\u2019 (www.nicholasbrealey.com) that if global carbon emissions were currency, most of the \u2018money\u2019 could be found in our office buildings, malls, hotels, factories, apartment buildings, and private homes.\u000a\u000aThe greatest consumers of energy today \u2013 and, in turn, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases \u2013 are our commercial, industrial, and residential buildings, he adds. \u201cHeating, air-conditioning, and electricity for what the industry calls \u2018the built environment\u2019 accounts for 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in the US (almost 60 per cent globally), almost twice the emissions of the automotive sector.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndustry challenge\u000a\u000aWhile, therefore, the built environment represents a high-leverage point for anyone looking to create eco-friendly energy systems, the building industry is tough to change, the author concedes. It is highly fragmented, and the competitiveness \u2013 and even suspicion \u2013 among different competing interests is just part of the way the business generally works, he frets.\u000a\u000aA quote in the book is of Bob Berkebile \u2013 the founding chairperson for the Committee on the Environment, created in 1990 within the American Institute of Architects (AIA) \u2013 that there can often be an adversarial relationship among the three main parties in any major project, viz. the owner/ developer, the architect, and the contractor. Developers, he says, tend to set their budget for total building costs as low as possible to maximise their profit on the project; architects, engineers, and construction firms then compete to maximise their share of the fixed budget!\u000a\u000aSuboptimal design\u000a\u000aThat is how you end up with buildings with the cheapest heating and air-conditioning systems, as opposed to the most efficient \u2013 despite the fact that a higher-priced, more efficient system would save the owner money in the long haul and be better for the environment, Senge explains.\u000a\u000aThe net result, he finds, is a suboptimal conventional design that wastes resources and has double or triple the operating costs of green buildings \u2013 costs that are passed on to occupants indefinitely. \u201cThose occupants may have their own goals \u2013 including comfort, healthy workers, productivity, and lower operating costs \u2013 but typically they have no involvement in the development process and relatively little influence over these factors (and costs) once the building is completed.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmall group\u000a\u000aIn the battle against the \u2018lowest-common-denominator\u2019 approach of the building industry, Bob and his AIA committee got help from David Gottfried, a small-town developer, and Michael Italiano, an environmental litigator, who believed there could be a better way.\u000a\u000aWhat began thus as \u2018a small group of like-minded people who were interested in genuinely addressing the total impact of buildings on the environment, human health and well-being, and communities\u2019 succeeded over a decade in establishing the US Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system, the author narrates.\u000a\u000aSince the competition and fragmentation within the industry thwarted real change, the founding group resolved to get representatives of the entire system involved from the outset, one learns. That meant real estate owners, financiers, engineers, architects, construction companies, and all of the roles involved in the full life cycle of real estate, as well as people from environmental organisations, government, and the media, as recounted through a quote of Jim Hartzfeld, a former president of the Council.\u000a\u000aBias for action\u000a\u000aDid the group begin with a grand vision of green building early in the process? No, the mantra was \u2018seek agreement and go,\u2019 with a bias towards action. Rather than try to resolve all the issues, the group members realised that they would have to \u2018go through many cycles of seeing the problem, clarifying their purpose.\u2019\u000a\u000aSuch an approach ultimately proved fortuitous, the author observes, because it made possible a more collaborative process of \u2018learning through doing\u2019 as more and more people engaged themselves in the process. \u201cHartzfeld and the others were discovering the first principle of building genuinely shared visions: It takes time, and along the way, engagement is worth much more than superficial agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aBasic question\u000a\u000aA basic question that the group had to find answer for was: What is a green building? The first collaborative project, launched in 1996, was therefore to develop \u2018an initial set of objective criteria to determine the key characteristics of a green building.\u2019\u000a\u000aImportantly, the guiding idea in this exercise was to see the building \u2018as a whole system and articulate all the interacting attributes.\u2019 For example, rather than designating a building as green because of the use of recycled materials, the group considered the whole system: \u2018the land, the site itself, how it uses water, how it uses energy, what materials are in it, what the indoor air quality is like, and the healthiness of the building for its occupants.\u2019\u000a\u000aThat implied the need for tapping the expertise of various professions associated with design, architecture, construction, and building maintenance; and also a lot of humility. \u201cOur contribution wasn\u2019t in knowing the knowledge in any one expert\u2019s head, but in bringing the expertise distributed across the industry into the conversation,\u201d elucidates Hartzfeld.\u000a\u000aCollective learning\u000a\u000aAgreeing on the initial LEED criteria was a four-year process, but when it took shape, it catalysed a collective learning process, whose power surprised everyone, writes Senge. It became \u2018something tangible, something that, however imperfect, people could touch and use.\u2019\u000a\u000aToday, the certification has spread around the world. There are GBCs in countries such as India, China, Brazil, and Mexico, which have become a powerful and unifying force within the building industry, the book acknowledges.\u000a\u000aNot astonishing, hence, should be a host of \u2018news\u2019 headlines you get when searching for \u2018LEED India,\u2019 in Google. Sample these, at the time of writing this: \u2018India\u2019s green building footprint increases: Jones LaSalle\u2019; \u2018Byculla Zoo eyes green status for building\u2019; \u2018Rashtrapati Bhavan, now a certified \u2018green\u2019 building\u2019\u2026\u000a\u000aRecommended addition to \u2018green\u2019 shelves.\u000a\u000a**\u000a\u000aBookPeek.blogspot.com

a((VIn some remote villages in India, which are most unlikely to pose as models of development, a quiet rejuvenation is taking place, with communities learning to adapt to the reality of the country today.\u000a\u000aEveryone knows by now that one of the foremost signs of for the country is the changing pattern of the monsoon. The Intergovernmental Panel on (IPCC) has already forecast shorter yet more intense monsoons, impacting two-thirds of India\u2019s farmers ( Fourth Assessment Report 2007), quite apart from the domino effect this has on the country\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, a 2009 Oxfam- field study in in and MP, and coastal shows that reviving ancient water systems, linked with low chemical-input agriculture, which is sometimes a mix of traditional knowledge and \u201cnewer\u201d methods, have helped poor farmers devise an effective strategy to cope with the changing monsoon.\u000a\u000aIn Tamil Nadu, a rain-shadow state that receives mostly cyclonic rains during October-December, with rivers drying out thereafter, the Gundar river-basin \u201cfeeding\u201d Madurai and four surrounding districts remain most vulnerable. \u201cI have seen, even as a little boy, that we cannot stop floods,\u201d says 62-year-old Gandhi, a farmer from Vellinipatti in Ramanathapuram district (\u201cVelinipatti\u201d means \u201cflood-protection\u201d in Tamil). \u201cBut now the rains are very heavy over a shorter period, causing frequent floods. Earlier we knew the seasons. Now we don\u2019t understand why this is happening,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThis region had an ancient, intricate watershed management system from 300 BC to 200 AD that channelled these seasonal waters into different systems dug in the earth, using the granitic rock base as leak-proof storage. A neerkatti, or water manager, appointed by the village was responsible for judicious distribution and conservation. The system served for millennia in mitigating drought but fell into disuse with, first, a colonial and, then, a post-independence governance system that usurped control of these water bodies. Deprived of ownership and their share of tank waters, local societies let them go to ruin.\u000a\u000aToday, has helped local communities revive this ancient system, complete with a village neerkatti. Villages contribute at least a quarter of the budget needed for renovation through a watershed association or vayalagam with paying members. Those benefiting from the tank contribute according to the size of their holdings at Rs 300 per acre. The remaining amount is received from government schemes or donor grants. The vayalagam also keeps Rs 20,000 for drought-relief, tank-repair or loans for soil and water-conservation. For the 20 per cent of the vayalagam\u2019s landless, fish-farming offers a livelihood.\u000a\u000aThe results are remarkable. Villur\u2019s ancient tank in Madurai district has now extended its command area from 25 acres to over 100 acres. Elsewhere in Sinkurni, communities now use inter-cropping to beat unpredictable rains, sowing cotton in August-September, interspersed with lentils like red and black gram. The black gram is reaped in three months, the red gram in six months and, the cotton in nine months. If the cotton fails for lack of water or other reasons, the lentils balance it out with their varied cropping periods.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is very significant,\u201d says of Dhan Foundation, \u201cis that Gundar\u2019s farmers already have knowledge about adapting to climate change, because the systems of flood mitigation and drought moderators have been with them since ancient times.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhy are these more successful than government watershed schemes? of Dhan Foundation says vayalagams have given a sense of ownership to the communities, who now maintain their own tanks. \u201cBut we need 7-12 years to make the entire catchment sustainable, otherwise it won\u2019t work,\u201d he asserts.\u000a\u000aHalf a country away, in UP\u2019s ravine-filled Bundelkhand, land-contouring through checkdams, spillways, bunds and channels to recharge groundwater from the sparse rains have also made significant improvements. Villagers in places like Tajpura and Sunderpura in Jalaun district now have adequate groundwater to enable tubewells or revive old wells to grow their own crops, irrespective of the weather. Using natural systems of bio-composting with farmyard manure and bio-pesticides, such as marigolds and watering from a tubewell, villagers have irrigated 75 bighas of land in Sunderpura for the first time with help from NGO Parmarth, .\u000a\u000a\u201cThe bonus is that wastelands have now become constructive agricultural lands with a safety system against climate change that has also checked migration to cities,\u201d says Anil Singh of Parmarth.\u000a\u000aIn Tajpura, farmers say vermi-composting the same farmyard manure doubles the produce. Ajan Singh and his wife Mamtadevi have managed to save over Rs 80,000 by growing organic vegetables on their one bigha of land. Their low-cost natural-input management system of cultivating vegetables has such a reputation for quality that all their produce gets sold locally at rates higher than market prices. Singh nets a minimum annual Rs 35,000-40,000 in a system that will stand him in good stead with reduced rains and rising temperature in the region.\u000a\u000aThe answer, thus, seems simple enough: revive old ponds, build new ones and teach the villagers how to manage it on their own. In other words, go back to old systems and bring people into the fold of responsibility.\u000a\u000aIt is the implementation of this that remains fragile. And since rural costs of water, natural-disaster management, food shortages and health issues are inherently linked to urban economics, we in the city are equally vulnerable if that rural pond goes dry.

File photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aFor those who are keen to leave a light footprint on the Earth, here\u2019s one way to accomplish it-\u201cAquamation\u201d, a new eco-alternative to burial and cremation. With land for burials in short supply and cremation producing around 150 kilograms of carbon dioxide per body - and as much as 200 micrograms of toxic mercury - aquamation is being touted as the greenest method for disposing of your mortal remains.\u000a\u000aThe corpse is placed into a steel container and potassium is added, followed by water heated to 93 degree Centigrade.\u000a\u000aThe flesh and organs are completely decomposed in 4 hours, leaving bones as the only solid remains.\u000a\u000aThis is similar to what\u2019s left after cremation, where the \u201cashes\u201d are in fact bones hardened in the furnace and then crushed.\u000a\u000aAquamation uses only 10 per cent of the energy of a conventional cremation and releases no toxic emissions, said John Humphries, chief executive of Aquamation Industries in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, who developed the technology. The decomposition process, called alkaline hydrolysis, \u201csimply speeds up the natural way that flesh decomposes in soil and water\u201d, he said.\u000a\u000aSimilar methods for decomposing corpses have been developed elsewhere, but they decompose corpses at much higher temperatures. Humphries says that aquamation, unlike cremation, will not destroy artificial implants such as hip replacements, allowing them to be reused, reports New Scientist.\u000a\u000aAnd after the body is decomposed, \u201cthe water is a fantastic fertiliser\u201d, he said.

a((VOLD GOA: Goa's cashew production has been drastically affected by climate change and the only way out for farmers is to increase production with better management practices, agricultural experts said at a seminar on Saturday."If in a hectare with 200 cashew trees a yield of even 2,000 kg nuts per annum is achieved it will yield an income of ` 1 lakh per annum for the farmer," said agriculture director S P Tendulkar. Tendulkar was speaking at a day-long seminar on "new challenges in cashew production under current trends of climate change" organized by ICAR Research Complex and the directorate of cashewnut and cocoa development, Kochi, at Old Goa. Pointing out that some farmers have achieved production of 4,000 kg per ha per annum from grafted trees, Tendulkar said Goa's average is 500 kg per ha per annum."There is no proper management and farmers have a casual attitude towards the crop despite its high income potential," he said. The cashew crop covers 55,000 ha for production of over 22,000 metric tonne (MT) and employs over a lakh people in the ` 200 crore industry. "With better management practices, production can be more than doubled," he said. Experts explained how irrigation and pest control which are not part of the average farmer's practice, can make a difference to the crop. Stating that it would be difficult to sustain the crop due to climate changes, Tendulkar said that changes seen during the last 50 years have been witnessed in just a few past years."During 2008-09 and 2009-10, the total production slid to 13.65 MT and 13.170 MT respectively from 27.071 MT in 2005-06 and 21.994 MT in 2007-08," said Tendulkar. Madhav Sahakari, president of Goa Cashew Processors Association said, "It is a crop requiring least care and hardly any water." But farmers who have hardly followed any management practices could easily increase production, which has stagnated at 22,000 to 25,000 MT with a little effort. Stating that it is important to produce more in Goa instead of importing cashew nuts of lesser quality, Sahakari said, "Goan cashew nuts command a premium price of 8% to 12% more than other products." V K Jha, secretary agriculture, said the state will soon sponsor a cashew cluster scheme in Ponda.

a((VPATNA: As part of International Year of Biodiversity celebrations and to create awareness about the importance of biodiversity in sustaining life on the earth, Shrikrishna Science Centre organised several events and activities for schoolchildren from August 17 to August 21.Delivering a lecture on `Climate change and water resources', Science College's geology professor Atul Aditya Pandey focused on the water resources like glaciers, surface run-offs and ground water and the impact of climate change on these resources.Even a little change in the temperature can affect the size and shape of glaciers, ultimately affecting all the perennial rivers, he said and added increased temperature, evaporation and precipitation also affect the pattern of rainfall. Rise in sea level due to melting of glaciers and ice caps can make a lot of fresh water saline, he said.Patna University's botany professor MP Trivedi spoke on the common medicinal plants available in Bihar. He said plant products are more acceptable to our body and herbal products have less side effects."During 25 years, we have developed 1000 drugs of which 50% are of plant origin,'' he said, adding 40% of the anti-cancer drugs are also of plant origin. Underlining the need to conserve plants and trees like Neem, Tulsi, Brahmi, Kalmegha, Ashwagandha and Ashoka, he asked the students to do their bit in popularizing the use of medicinal plants.Patna Women's College principal Sister Doris D'souza, called in to deliver a lecture on the fourth day of the series, dwelt at length on how human interventions are destroying the rich biodiversity. To prevent this, she said, students need to be motivated and sensitized through field trips, film shows on environment etc.Speaking on the last day, RK Sinha, popularly known as `Dolphin Man', said there is a need to look for a different source of energy generation instead of making large dams. The highlight of his lecture was the information about Ganga dolphins.Several informative movies were screened for the students on the occasion, and they included `The Last Dance', `The Hunted', `Turtles In A Soup', `Once There Was A Purple Butterfly', `Leopards In The Lurch', `The Silenced Witness', `Diminishing Resources', `Climate's First Orphans' and `The Weeping Apple Tree'.At the end of the programme, prizes were distributed to the winners of a poster-making contest on the topic, `Biodiversity of our land', in which 160 students from 16 schools participated. Rashmi Ranjan, a class XI student of Government Senior Secondary School-Gardanibagh, and Juhi Bareria, a class IX student of St Annes High School-Patna City, were adjudged winners in the senior and junior categories respectively.

a((VNew Zealands sheep farmers are flocking to a government carbon trading programme that pays more to plant trees than sell wool and mutton. The system, begun in 2008 and the only one of its kind outside Europe, awards farmers credits that are sold to offset greenhouse gas emissions. The project may earn them about NZ$600 a hectare ($172 per acre) a year on land unprofitable for grazing animals.\u000a\u000aForests planted for carbon credits may increase to 30,000 hectares a year compared with 3,500 hectares in 2009, the government estimates. The system is a welcome alternative for sheep farmers whove struggled for decades from a combination of slumping wool prices, drought and competition for land from the dairy and lumber industries, says Neil Walker, a forester in the Taranaki region of New Zealands North Island. If youre an industry in decline, you have to see what options are available, said Walker, who also heads the Taranaki Regional Councils policy and planning committee. Theres an economic case to be made for converting hill-country sheep farms to forests.\u000a\u000aSheep have been in decline for decades and have fallen in number from a 1982 peak of 70 million to about 40 million. Carbon trading is embraced by some farmers and rejected by others as too harsh a change for New Zealand, the worlds biggest sheep meat exporter last year.\u000a\u000aThe nations carbon-trading project was expanded in July to require energy producers to pay for their emissions. By 2015, the system will include agriculture, forcing farmers to pay for emissions their cows and sheep make through belching. That, says Don Nicolson, president of Federated Farmers of New Zealand, is too big a burden on its 25,000 members. The Wellington-based group opposed the programme, particularly after it became clear the nation would adopt the policy largely alone. Australias government shelved a carbon trading plan in April. Were the only national emissions trading scheme outside of Europe, said Nigel Brunel, head of futures trading at Auckland-based OM Financial, which acts as a broker for carbon trading. If at the end of 2012 were the only country standing there, then we will give up. Spot prices for carbon credits were NZ$18.45 per metric tonne on August 16. The market remains in limbo until more credits are available and the deadline for offsetting emissions comes closer.\u000a\u000aUntil December 2012, theres a transition period in which companies in the system have the option to pay a carbon tax on emissions capped at NZ$25 per tonne, or buy carbon credits backed by forestry. They also need to offset only one tonne of emissions for every two they produce. Demand will be constant and supply is likely to be lumpy and infrequent.\u000a\u000aEven the government says the programme will have little impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. New Zealand ranks 51st in greenhouse gas emissions with 0.2% of the global total, according to the United Nations. Rather, the government introduced carbon trading to enhance the countrys green image, boost exports, attract tourists and increase influence in global climate talks.\u000a\u000aThe difficulties for back-country sheep farms began when the government deregulated New Zealands economy in 1984, scrapping the subsidies that had incentivised farmers to convert marginal scrubland to pasture since the 1960s. Over the years, the converted land became more unprofitable as fertiliser prices rose when subsidies were removed. Carbon has the potential to markedly alter the profitability of hill country. That land is not marginally economic to farm for sheep and cattle, its totally uneconomic. Theres a real opportunity for land use change here.\u000a\u000aAt Cambridge Forest & Native Nursery in the centre of New Zealands North Island, the emissions trading scheme is a significant reason for year-on-year sales growth of 35%. The company has already sold all of next years supply of radiata pine saplings, a softwood used to make frames for houses. Introduction of carbon trading incentives will add to an existing trend to convert pasture land for forest, driven by sales of lumber to China.\u000a\u000aSince 1990, about 3.5 million hectares, or 28%, of land used for grazing sheep and beef has switched use. About a quarter went to dairy and the rest to forests, urban development and conservation, according to Meat & Wool New Zealand. Also, log exports from New Zealand to China more than doubled in the year ended March to 5.4 million cubic metres, driving a NZ$300 million increase in log export earnings to NZ$1.1 billion, official data show.\u000a\u000aCarbon trading makes planting forests even more appealing. Instead of waiting for trees to grow before they can sell the timber, theyre now paid annually for storing carbon. It turns forestry into a cash flow business.\u000a\u000aNot all farmers are happy with the trend.\u000a\u000aFederated Farmers Nicolson estimates 20%, or 2,800, sheep and beef farms could be replaced by carbon forests, harming communities that rely on livestock farming for jobs as shearers, mechanics and vets. He said farmers are being sold on the profit in carbon farming without understanding the risks, such as losing trees to fires or disease, or the government cancelling the programme.\u000a\u000aYou cant blame farmers whove had their profitability tested from taking a punt on their marginal land, Nicolson says. The trouble is, it comes with massive risk and thats not whats being talked about.\u000a\u000aMany hill farmers are already struggling and rural depopulation from loss of jobs is already taking place, says Edwyn Kight, a farmer and a member of Federated Farmers. It hasnt happened because of forestry, its happened because of economics.\u000a\u000aFor farmers like Kight, whose sheep and cattle are part of the exports Key wants to protect, the trading scheme is a means to stay in business. You dont want it to be a call for the last one around to turn out the lights, he said. Thats what it was coming to.

a((VThe recent high-profile acquisition of a small electric car company by an auto giant seems to have electrified the industry, which has been experiencing robust growth. As the world seeks solutions to high polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel transportation, electric vehicles could offer a viable solution."But where is the electricity?" people ask as they grapple with power cuts in the midst of a scorching summer. Whether it makes the power availability worse when everybody plugs their car into their home is a legitimate worry.Why would the Delhi government even consider deploying electric vehicles with these constraints? In March this year, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit discussed a plan to promote electric vehicles (EVs) as a mode of transport. Along with promoting efficient public transport, this could be an appropriate solution to increasing urban air pollution and severe congestion, which is also driving up greenhouse gas emissions and turbo-charging India's fossil fuel import bill.Given the Indian economy's unhealthy dependence on fossil-fuels, over 70% of which has to be imported, any technology that helps phase out oil-dependent forms of transport should be seriously considered. EVs not only provide cleaner environment, but also reduce the dependency of the transport sector on imports and price volatility of fossil fuels. The energy efficiency of EVs is 46% higher than internal combustion engines (ICEs). They also have the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13-68% compared to ICEs. With the help of advanced V2G (vehicle-to-grid) technology, deployment of electric vehicles can directly decrease the emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants within a vehicle's lifecycle, which will significantly relieve air pollution in cities. Through peak-shaving (sending power back to the grid when demand is high), EVs can also indirectly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Key technologies such as batteries, electric motors and motor controllers are still undergoing improvements, along with manufacturing techniques of lithium-ion batteries, including material, battery design and process control . The key performance indicators of batteries, such as power output, longevity, consistency and safety, can still be further improved, and the apprehensions of electricity shortages can be managed by ensuring that cars are charged at off-peak hours.Given the uncertainty around the global economy and, post-Copenhagen, political direction on climate change many are advocating a wait-and-watch policy. However, India's auto market is showing robust growth of over 20%. Can it afford to slow down as the world searches for sustainable and low carbon solutions to a fuel guzzling pathway?China doesn't seem to think so, and its going about developing its electric vehicle market in right earnest."Electric vehicles are driving economic growth and providing a radical solution for the energy needs of transportation," said Wan Gang, China's Minister of Science and Technology in November 2009. "The Chinese government actively promotes EV development, by providing more funding and favourable policy to EV related infrastructure construction and investment," added Wan Gang.Many more nations are increasing their efforts in commercialising EVs. A meeting to help fast-track global development of electric vehicles was convened by Climate Group. A group of 25 mayors and heads of regional governments, policy-makers, manufacturers and bankers from over eight countries met in Copenhagen on the sidelines of the UN's climate talks to discuss electric vehicle development around the world.The Indian government too has initiated moves towards a policy on EVs. In April this year an inter-ministerial group was created to conduct a feasibility study and frame a policy by the end of the current fiscal year. At present 4% excise duty is levied on production of EVs, while components attract 10%. Imported EVs are charged 14% duty.Despite the constraints, electric scooters and small buses, much more than cars, are becoming popular in Indian mega-cities like Delhi & Bangalore. Many auto manufacturers have either already launched or gearing up to launch EVs in India.Given India's abundant sunlight, the electricity required for EVs has the potential to be produced from various natural sources like solar energy. India's established auto component manufacturing infrastructure, modest manufacturing and R&D costs, high urban congestion and the presence of a large domestic market could make it a significant global player in electric vehicles.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThere are several ways of honouring men of eminence. Short of a Nobel, M.S. Swaminathan, renowned agricultural scientist, has received innumerable awards and honours. And now, the Indian Institute of Science publishing his selected papers as a part of their \u2018Centenary Lecture Series' is an honour that would go a long way in inspiring science to serve society more and more.\u000a\u000aIn this collection of 28 papers, all but a few \u2014 published in Nature and Annals of Genetics \u2014 are on different dimensions of science in relation to sustainable food security. Although published over a long time span, 1965-2009, the papers reveal his pioneering interest right through in issues affecting not just crop productivity and biotechnology but also bio-safety, biodiversity, climate change, and food and nutrition security, which have become major concerns today.\u000a\u000aRole of science\u000a\u000aSetting the tone for a proper understanding of his contribution to the green revolution, Swaminathan, in the introduction, provides a graphic view of the role of science in India's progress on the farm front, from the \u201cship to mouth\u201d state in food supplies to self-sufficiency and to a position of having substantial buffer stocks. It is noteworthy that, even as early as in 1968, he warned the Punjab farmers against excessive use of fertilizers and extraction of too much groundwater lest the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d should become a \u201cgreed revolution.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ill-effects of excesses in the name of green revolution are discussed in the address he delivered at the Indian Science Congress. Some of the major points he made are: Intensive cultivation sans efforts to conserve soil fertility and structure will lead to desertification; irrigation without proper drainage will make the soil alkaline or saline; indiscriminate use of pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides can adversely alter the biological balance \u2014 and, worse, may well cause a higher incidence of cancer and other diseases, thanks to the presence of toxic residues in the grains; and unscientific groundwater tapping will lead to a rapid depletion of this capital resource. But then, chemical fertilizer and pesticide manufacturers had their own ways of persuading farmers to go for quick gains.\u000a\u000aThe ecological problems associated with intensive farming, characterised by excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable groundwater extraction, are gone into extensively in his Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture (1999). He highlights the need for mainstreaming concerns in the development and dissemination of technology to sustain agricultural advance and food security. His search for ways of mobilising science to raise biological productivity levels without harming ecology leads him to what he calls \u201cevergreen revolution.\u201d This concept envisages pathways that preclude the use of mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides, and genetically modified crops and call for the adoption of integrated pest and nutrition management practices and the cultivation of appropriate crop varieties.\u000a\u000aPriorities\u000a\u000aA firm believer in biotechnology, Swaminathan strongly feels \u2014 as it emerges from this collection \u2014 that priorities in biotechnology research should be driven not by the market forces but by the long term well-being of the humankind. Biodiversity and bio-future warrant shared goals and actions in conserving and using biological diversity. One of the major concerns is equity in sharing the benefits of genetic resources. The poor, mostly the tribal and rural women, are the primary conservers of genetic diversity, but they get hardly anything in return. On the other hand, those who use their knowledge not only make huge profits but also get plant varietal protection and royalties. The FAO's initiative to end this unethical anomaly and protect the \u2018farmers rights' has not yielded any significant result so far. On the food security concerns in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, there is a suggestion that the Indian experience, marked by a strong national research capability and a multifaceted strategy suitable to the ecology and culture, holds promise for Africa.\u000a\u000aSwaminathan's writings since 1973 show a remarkable prescience in suggesting ways of meeting the challenge of climate change, and they include evolving codes for drought and flood management; \u2018seed security' with contingency plans to suit different rainfall patterns; and development of climate risk management cadres at the grassroots level. Studies establish that promotion of ecologically sustainable agricultural and food production systems and the task of adapting to changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea levels call for enormous financial and technical resources, and this necessarily requires international cooperation. A better future for all, he feels, will not be possible without a better present.\u000a\u000aSwaminathan's abiding interest is, however, in using science for strengthening the small-farmer economy and in community approach to food and nutrition security. The success stories are drawn from Sri Lanka and Thailand, and the MSS Foundation's own initiatives, and the strategy for India is a life-cycle approach and community \u201cfood banks\u201d, including locally grown millets, at the village level. The breadth of history, the depth of science in Einsteinian social perspective, the nuanced reflections on the contribution and conditions of humble peasantry, and an informed concern over the ecological imbalance and climate change \u2014 all these distinguishing features of the volume make it a rewarding reading. Non-scientists need not be put off by the title.\u000a\u000aThese papers project M.S. Swaminathan as a \u201csimultaneously vertical and horizontal man\u201d (to borrow an expression from him), representing a blend of clarity and precision on complex matters of science and an unflinching commitment to the cause of agriculture, with \u2018food for the poor' and \u2018food productivity of the poor farmer' at the core.

a((VNew Delhi, Aug. 23: The Planning Commission has proposed that coal mining be allowed in phases in all blocks allotted till the end of last fiscal, with tree cover restored once mining was over.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the environment ministry had divided forests into “go” and “no go” areas on the basis of forest cover, which would severely limit production of miners, particularly Coal India Limited.\u000a\u000aRecently, the Prime Minister’s Office had reviewed the environment ministry’s position. However, the Planning Commission, in a note, has observed that going by the environment ministry’s directive Coal India’s mining area will be reduced by 30 per cent.\u000a\u000aAccording to the note — “Meeting Coal Demand in Eleventh Plan and other Issues” — Coal India could see a drop in output by about 45 million tonnes annually. This move was seen jeopardising one of the biggest public issues planned by the finance ministry — Coal India’s Rs 15,000-crore IPO in October.\u000a\u000aCoal belts affected by the environment ministry’s order are Hasdev and Mandarigarh in Chhattisgarh, Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh and Ib Valley in Orissa. Besides Coal India, several other groups that would be affected include the Tatas, Reliance Power and Hindustan Zinc.\u000a\u000aThe environment ministry’s classification can put 619 million tonnes of coal annually out of the reach of miners.\u000a\u000aAccording to the plan panel note, “It has to be appreciated that coal mining is carried out in the world in most developed countries. No country is letting its energy resources idle unless it has other alternative.\u000a\u000a“A broad balanced approach will be to utilise our domestic mineral resources while taking full safeguards for the development of forests and environment.”\u000a\u000aIt suggested a review of the policy by an inter-ministerial committee and permitting mining in phases in the blocks allotted till March 31, 2010. “As one gets completed, the area should be afforested (by the miner) and handed over for management to the ministry of environment and forests.”\u000a\u000aThe note goes on to say that “in case of extremely dense forests, the ministry of coal should explore underground mining.” Senior government officials said Coal India, too, had proposed an alternative several months back.

a((VThe 16th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit held earlier this year in Bhutan focused on climate change. The subcontinent is facing unprecedented disasters with extreme precipitation events in many locations and public perception seems to link these with climate change. Single events like those occurring in Pakistan, Ladakh and Uttarakhand can\u2019t, on a scientific basis, be ascribed to human-induced climate change. But on the basis of assessed observations the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has come up with clear findings.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been stated clearly that the frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most areas. There is also an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts apart from the incidence of extreme high sea level having increased worldwide (defined as the highest 1 per cent of hourly values of observed sea level at a station for a given reference period). The situation in a large area of Pakistan is tragic. At the same time, a cloudburst in Ladakh has led to intensive damage to property and many deaths. Children in Uttarakhand have lost their lives as a result of a massive downpour. Pakistan, in particular, needs global assistance on a gigantic scale because over 20 million people would need to be rehabilitated and fed.\u000a\u000aThe threat of large-scale outbreak of diseases, as a consequence of floods, would overwhelm the ability of existing services and infrastructure to deal with the problem. India\u2019s offer of $5 million for emergency relief is a welcome gesture, which, fortunately, the Government of Pakistan has accepted. However, given the scale of requirements of assistance that Pakistan now faces, it\u2019d be appropriate for India to increase this assistance to a much higher level.\u000a\u000aNature sees no political boundaries, and in this respect it\u2019s heartening that the summit in Thimphu chose climate change as the central theme. In the final declaration from this summit, the leaders of Saarc nations emphasised the need to initiate a process to formulate a common Saarc position for the forthcoming Conference of the Parties (CoP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Cancún, Mexico.\u000a\u000aOn the eve of the Rio Summit in 1992, all the Saarc nations requested India to organise a briefing workshop in New Delhi, conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri). A similar request by Pakistan and Sri Lanka was also met through a similar workshop organised by Teri before the CoP in Kyoto in 1997.\u000a\u000aThe impacts of climate change, though diverse across the subcontinent, have several commonalities. The AR4 found that climate change is expected to exacerbate existing stresses on water resources stemming from population growth and economic and land use change, including urbanisation. While this is an observation applicable to most parts of the globe, it\u2019s particularly relevant to South Asia. Furthermore, on a regional scale, mountain snow pack, glaciers and small icecaps play a crucial role in fresh water availability. Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes) where more than one sixth of the world population currently lives.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the extent of research and monitoring of glacier activity related to the Himalayas is inadequate in South Asia. On the other hand, there is a considerably higher level of measurement, monitoring and research on glaciers in Tibet. In a well-researched paper, a group of Chinese scientists have concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the warm-dry trend in the Central Himalayas will continue under the projected future warming and that glacier retreat will accelerate\u201d.\u000a\u000aSouth Asia is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and a coordinated and cooperative approach for meeting this challenge across the Saarc region would benefit every member-country, through pooling of expertise and consolidation of experience.\u000a\u000aThe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee \u2014 a well-known non-governmental organisation from Bangladesh \u2014 is active today in the flood-hit areas of Pakistan, using a wealth of expertise gained from tackling perennial floods in Bangladesh.\u000a\u000aThe first step is to ensure linkages among research institutions in the region because we need to assess projected future impacts of climate change using sophisticated modelling with downscaled global climate models. This is being carried out by Teri for many Indian states where the diversity of ecosystems and topography is such that the impacts of climate change are also diverse. Through the creation and dissemination of relevant knowledge related to climate change, the public and governments of this region can be sensitised to action that is needed for adaptation to the impacts of climate change and appropriate mitigation measures.\u000a\u000aThe Bhutan summit needs an urgent follow-up by bringing various institutions and organisations together to meet this common challenge, and as a unique confidence-building measure. Political barriers should not come in the way of ensuring the welfare and livelihoods of the current and future generations.\u000a\u000aR.K.

a((VWhile there is enough talk about how the climate is changing and carbon footprints of developing countries are getting out of control, a bevy of professionals have been driving a revolution without the rhetoric. These professionals, called energy conservation specialists, help various companies cut down their energy consumption, saving them money and conserving one of the nation\u2019s most prized resources.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnergy conservation has been developing as a science as well as a profession since the early \u201970s and is widely believed to have started in the US. As most of you would be aware, energy is neither created nor destroyed. It is simply converted from one form to the other by the action of various processes.\u000a\u000aHowever, during these processes, some of the energy is converted into forms that are not intended or can\u2019t be utilised. Think of the simple example of an incandescent lightbulb. When electricity passes through the filament, it glows due to the material\u2019s resistance and light is produced. However, due to the same resistance, heat is also produced and that is energy being wasted \u2013 both in terms of electricity used and unutilised heat (these also add to cooling costs, one of the biggest components of domestic power usage). One solution is switching to compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), which use less power and heat up less.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnergy conservation specialists do something similar for industrial units though of course it is far more complex. Such a professional would first conduct \u201ca survey of energy consuming areas such as equipment, processes, facilities, utilities etc and arrive at accurate data and information on specific energy consumption\u201d, says Ramesh Bhatia, consultant, Schneider Electric India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is the starting point for an energy audit, which determines wastages and excesses that occur in energy consumption in an industry, building or facility.\u000a\u000aIt also helps to determine the benchmarks for consumption in equipment, process or facility. A necessary component of this activity is to arrive at the ways and means of avoiding such wastages and operate at benchmarks, Bhatia adds.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe follow-through after an audit is energy management. \u201cThis requires measurement of energy consumption through instruments and communicating this data to server, which is loaded with appropriate software. Thus, the energy consumption data is available online, in real time without human intervention,\u201d says Bhatia.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat follows is reporting and recommending fixes such as use of passive energy conservation measures such as low consumption devices like CFLs in place of bulbs, star-rated fans, refrigerators and airconditioners, power-factor correction in electrical distribution, improving insulation etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cOur government has made rules for compulsory energy audits for big companies and production houses and has also given subsidies to small-scale companies to be able to do it. It will soon become compulsory for small-scale industries in the future,\u201d says Piyush Kakadia, proprietor, Total Energy Consultant, a government certified, Ahmedabad-based energy auditor.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn India, the Energy Conservation Act 2001 governs energy conservation in almost all industry sectors.

Vedanta\u2019s project in Orissa is valued at about Rs450 billion ($9.6 billion).\u000a\u000aVedanta is already facing regulatory hurdles in its bid for control of Cairn India, which would give billionaire Anil Agarwal\u2019s group a slice of India\u2019s oil reserves and exposure to surging energy demand in the country.\u000a\u000aLate on Monday, an oil ministry source said all options were open for Indian state energy firms to make a counter bid.\u000a\u000aA banking source familiar with the matter told Reuters that ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India) \u2014 all state-controlled \u2014 were considering a joint bid for Cairn India, but said no banks had been mandated yet to arrange a bid. All three firms declined to comment late on Monday.\u000a\u000aLondon-listed shares in Vedanta were down more than 5% on Tuesday and shares of its Mumbai-listed unit Sterlite Industries, fell as much as 4.9%.\u000a\u000aShares in Cairn India rose nearly 6% on Tuesday in an otherwise subdued Mumbai market on hopes of a counter-bid by state-run firms, as well as a new energy discovery in India announced late on Monday.\u000a\u000aGovernment officials have expressed concern about Vedanta\u2019s proposed purchase of Cairn India. India considers energy a strategic asset.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are very clear when it comes to petroleum and gas. These are national resources and that is what the Supreme Court has also upheld. But the concerned ministry and ONGC, which is a partner -- they have to take a view,\u201d Trade Minister Anand Sharma said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aEnvironment vs commerce\u000a\u000aVedanta is among several top corporations, including South Korea\u2019s POSCO, whose Indian projects face delay as a proactive environment ministry tightens rules that often brings it in conflict with other government ministries pushing for rapid industrialisation.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh said the decision did not amount to \u201cblacklisting\u201d Vedanta, signalling that the firm could seek to mine elsewhere provided it stuck to the rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere has been serious violations of environment protection acts,\u201d Ramesh told reporters while rejecting Vedanta\u2019s mining plans that could destroy heavily forested hills sacred to local tribal populations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no emotion, no politics, no prejudice ... I have taken the decision in a purely legal approach. That these laws are being violated.\u201d\u000a\u000aVedanta says the mining site is located in an uninhabited area so no one will be displaced, and that the project will help lift the poor district out of poverty.\u000a\u000aA company spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday and said a formal statement would be issued later.\u000a\u000aRefinery under cloud\u000a\u000aThe environment ministry decision comes after a government panel said last week giving permission to Vedanta would violate green guidelines and may have serious impact on security, referring to a worsening Maoist insurgency that feeds partly off the resentment of people displaced by large industrial projects.\u000a\u000aIn what could threaten Vedanta\u2019s one-million-tonne alumina refinery plant in Orissa as well, Ramesh said the factory was sourcing bauxite from mines in an adjacent state that did not have valid environmental clearances.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis matter is being examined separately,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aRamesh wants to protect and expand India\u2019s remaining forest land as part of a strategy to fight climate change, but that could mean giving up mining about a quarter of the country\u2019s mineral reserves, needed to power Asia\u2019s third-largest economy.

a((VUpdated: Wed, Aug 25 2010. 10 29 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: By 2015, every state in India will need to source at least 10% of its energy from clean sources. Coupled with this is the mammoth solar mission, which mandates 20GW of solar energy in the country by 2022.\u000a\u000aAlthough both are the outcome of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, the move towards renewable energy, experts hold, is more pertinent from an energy security point of view than climate-change mitigation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia is a rapidly growing economy and energy demand, and the Indian government is already facing difficulties in facing the growing demand,\u201d said Matthias Fawer, vice-president, Sarasin Sustainable Investment, a branch of Bank Sarasin and CIE AG, which focuses on sustainable investments. \u201cIn this respect, renewable energy starts making more and more sense.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt this point, carbon reduction is sort of an add-on, he said.\u000a\u000aGraphic: Yogesh Kumar/Mint \u201cAt present, clean energy reduces dependency on coal and oil and is a domestic resource, which reduces this dependency,\u201d said Fawer. \u201cMoreover, it has the potential to add a lot of jobs in India internally.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has already asked state counterparts to notify Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) regulations in order for utilities to meet their renewable purchase obligation (RPO). The CERC had issued guidelines on issuing RECs from September to promote green energy. Those who hold the certificates will be able to sell green energy to states, individuals or other trading entities.\u000a\u000aAmong states, however, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur and Mizoram have already notified final regulations. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have notified draft regulations. Some states such as Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab and Karnataka are yet to make a move.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of the SERCs (state electricity regulatory commissions) haven\u2019t specified RPO guidelines so far primarily because of three reasons,\u201d said a renewable energy analyst, who did not wish to be identified. \u201cFirstly, yes, there is relatively lower potential in some states and the SERCs need to ensure that the RPO trajectory specified by them is achievable. Secondly, the SERCs need to assess the impact of the RPO on the retail tariffs. Thirdly, the delay is also due to the REC mechanism, which is in the final stage of implementation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe REC mechanism is expected to be an effective tool for meeting RPO and to some extent this tool will also address the problem of renewable energy potential being specific to certain states and regions. States have been allotted different renewable energy purchase obligations because of differences in potential. While Gujarat met its target for 2009-10, states such as Tamil Nadu came close.\u000a\u000aSixteen state electricity regulatory commissions have specified the RPOs for their licensee distribution companies. They have also notified regulations to determine the tariff of energy generated from renewable sources, according to the Forum of Regulators, a platform which consists of the chairpersons of CERC and SERCs.\u000a\u000aIndia has huge potential for renewable energy sources, especially solar energy. Theoretically, India has solar potential of 5 trillion kWh per year. The potential for non-solar resources is another 85,000MW, according to a recent Crisil Infrastructure Advisory report. Of that, only around 17,220MW has been tapped. This includes 69% from wind energy, 16% from small hydropower units and 8% from co-generation. The remaining 7% covers solar energy and other sources, according to Crisil.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia is still in its developing phase in terms of installation of solar energy projects and solar photovoltaics (PV) are still very far behind,\u201d said Fawer. \u201cAccording to our estimate, over the next 5-10 years, there will be 100% annual average growth in terms of PV. It makes more sense, especially in rural Indian areas, who don\u2019t have access to electricity.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that weaning rural households way from the use of diesel and kerosene as power sources will enable better indoor air health.\u000a\u000aLast year saw wind capacity of 1200MW of being installed, while solar was way behind at 80MW, but photovoltaics will catch up, he said. The decentralized use of solar, as well as biomass energy plants, is the most touted solution to millions of households, mostly rural, lacking access to power.\u000a\u000aStill, transmission in remote areas remains a challenge because of the low and dispersed capacity of renewable energy plants.\u000a\u000aFor Ratnesh Yadav, an entrepreneur in Bihar\u2019s hinterland in biomass energy, the bottlenecks are somewhere else.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ministry of new and renewable energy has been trying a lot to promote clean energy. They have been giving subsidy but they lack foresight,\u201d said Yadav. \u201cWe need policy, which will promote entrepreneurs but if we want to scale up, are there enough manufacturers? Biggest problem is we don\u2019t have enough gensets.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt present, his company, Husk Power Systems, operates about 40 plants in Bihar and supplies power to about 20,000 households, including shops.\u000a\u000aFor Vivek Gupta, director, Saran Renewable Energy Pvt Ltd, which is another Bihar-based biomass energy company, raising capital is the biggest problem.\u000a\u000a\u201cCapital is a constraint. The normal banker is reluctant. We have managed somehow but it is hard,\u201d said Gupta. \u201cI spent a year to raise money but if the government had helped us, it would have been quicker. Secondly, we set up plants in an area and then the grid came to the same area. The government, in this manner, is also disturbing business plans.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite this and international negotiations on climate change practically grinding to a halt, India\u2019s domestic clean energy scenario is abuzz with activity. Till 2020, India has a formidable target.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe 2020 target is far but is a milestone which makes sense,\u201d said Fawer. \u201cOf course, it might need need some adjustments on the way but it\u2019s a realistic goal.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo read our earlier articles in the India Agenda series, go to www.livemint.com/indiaagenda\u000a\u000apadmaparna.g@livemint.com

Our growing economy will demand additional power. The government\u2019s integrated energy policy (IEP) estimates that electricity demand will grow 4-5 times by 2030. Power projects are causing social stress across India due to their conflicting demands on scarce water and land resources, displacement of people and local pollution. Limited coal resources in India and the increasing threat of climate change will limit the total coal capacity we can aspire for. This necessitates a critical relook at our energy policy. Rather than pursuing energy security through elusive options such as nuclear power, it is important to concentrate on quick implementation of energy efficiency, people-centric decentralized use of renewable energy and reducing the cost of such grid-connected power through competition while addressing governance issues.\u000a\u000aAs the first step, we need to ensure adoption of energy efficiency to the fullest extent. The adoption of the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, with an aim of reducing demand by 20GW over the next four years, is a good start. The efficiency resource, over the next 10 to 15 years is much greater than the combined supply potential of large hydro and nuclear power. In spite of the full utilization of efficiency resources, we will need to augment supply through renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThis is the fastest growing energy sector in the world today, with investments in its capacity having overtaken fossil-fuel capacity addition in the last two years. India has a grid-connected renewable energy capacity of 17GW, which is one-tenth of total power generation capacity. The bulk of this comes through wind power. We have also added half a GW of renewable energy plants in the off-grid mode to electrify nearly 7,000 villages.\u000a\u000aGoing ahead, India needs a multi-pronged strategy for renewable energy promotion. First, we should utilize relatively low cost (non-solar) renewable energy resources, which are estimated by MNRE to be around 85GW. The largest of this is wind power, whose present cost is 50% higher than that of coal-based power without considering the externalities of coal. While the National Action Plan on Climate Change has set a target of 15% energy from renewable energy by 2020, such a target should be reviewed considering economically usable resources, and an acceptable impact on consumer tariff, while the cost burden of this expensive electricity should not passed on to poor and agricultural consumers.\u000a\u000aSecond, renewable energy cost reduction through innovation needs to be supported. The recently introduced National Clean Energy Fund will generate Rs3,000 crore per year through a small cess on coal and is a step in the right direction. To begin with, this fund should be leveraged wisely to support innovation in clean energy technologies, demonstration projects and the renewable energy manufacturing industry. Third, while the solar resource is theoretically abundant, it is expensive. The regulated price for solar power is nearly six times that of coal and four times that of wind power. Competition and technology development will no doubt lower solar costs, but they are unlikely to compete with coal power over the next decade. But solar PV technology, even at the present cost, is economical for applications in remote areas and should be used for ensuring a reliable supply for social infrastructure such as schools, primary health centres and drinking water distribution systems. This is in line with the view of energy security as espoused in the IEP, namely, \u201csupply lifeline energy to all our citizens irrespective of their ability to pay\u2026 at competitive prices, at all times.\u201d\u000a\u000aGirish Sant is trustee and Ashwin Gambhir is a researcher at Pune-based Prayas Energy Group.

The $5.86 billion Xiaowan is China's second largest hydro power project after the world biggest Three Gorges dam which has capacity to produce 700 Mw of power. The new project could produce 19 billion kWh of electricity every year.\u000a\u000a"The rapid development of the hydro power industry is of great significance to optimising China's energy structure and reducing carbon emissions," Sun Yucai, executive vice chairman of the Electricity Council, said at the ceremony to commission the project.\u000a\u000apromised at the Copenhagen Conference on global climate change last year that China would cut its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020. It also undertook a commitment to generate 15 per cent of its power from non-fossil sources by 2020, up from the current 7.8 per cent.\u000a\u000aAs the most competitive non-fossil energy, hydro power was the key for China to realise its emissions reduction goal, Sun said.\u000a\u000aHard pressed to meet its Copenhagen commitments to reduce green house gases, China will expand its hydro power capacity to 300 million kw by 2015 from the current 200 million kw in an effort to cut emissions, Zhang Guobao, director of the National Energy Administration (NEA), said.\u000a\u000aChina has long relied on coal to fuel its economic growth with about 83 per cent of its electricity produced by coal-fired stations. China's annual hydro electricity production is 585.2 TWh, which is the largest in the world.\u000a\u000aThe country is followed by Canada (369.5 TWh) and Brazil (363.8 TWh).\u000a\u000aTo match the installed hydro power capacity of 200 million kilowatts, thermal power plants would have to burn 288 million tonnes of coal equivalent, emit 855 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and 5.4 million tonnes of carbon sulphur dioxide every year, according to China Electricity Council estimates.\u000a\u000aZhang said that hydro projects with another 70 million kilowatts capacity were under construction, and another 100 million kilowatts of capacity was needed.\u000a\u000a"If all the planned hydro power projects begin construction in the next three years, it is still possible to expand the current installed hydro power capacity to 380 million kilowatts by 2020," Zhang said.

I don\u2019t want to sound alarmist, but the scenario that emerged from our discussions was earth-shattering, to say the least. I realized with pain and anguish that the world as I know will never be the same again.The snow-capped mountains, the pine and the deodar trees reaching out to the sky, clear streams meandering through with an unhurried elegance, the twittering of birds amid a golden sunset and even a waft of fresh breeze will soon become a thing of the past and a luxury no amount of money will be able to buy. Fuelled by man\u2019s lust for senseless and insensitive development, wastelands, floods, storms, starvation, growing sea levels and submergence of low-lying areas have all become a common occurrence.The developed world, the developing world, callous governments, insensitive people, senseless industrialization, obsession with GDP numbers \u2014 all play a part in ruining this planet. But more than finger-pointing, the right thing to do was to stand up and make a contribution, no matter how small or humble it may be. I decided then and there that the JSW Foundation would go ahead and try to make a difference.The enormity of the problem is such that governments and policy makers the world over should strive for a global consensus. Moreover, we in India should also realize that it is in our immediate interests that we move towards a low carbon future. Some of the facts are worth mentioning here:lIndia is currently one of the fastest growing economies. With a share of one-sixth of the world\u2019s population, India\u2019s emissions are set to increase dramatically.lThe frightening aspects of global warming have already manifest in India \u2014 retreating glaciers, unpredictable monsoons, floods, droughts, disappearing forest cover...lIt is well-documented that the weaker sections of society will find it more difficult to cope with climate change. With 27% of the population living below the poverty line, we as Indians should come out of our complacencylOur dependence on agriculture is very high and it has been proved that even a one-degree rise in temperature will lead to a drop in wheat production by 4-5million tonneslDisappearing forests will not only adversely impact local climates but will also affect the livelihood of the poor people who have based their lives on forest products.Over the years, my appreciation has grown with reference to two aspects of sustainable development that are intertwined. The first is about the felt need to evolve from packaged community welfare to enable community participation in a way that fosters environment-friendly interventions. The second aspect is about climate change mitigation and adaptation with several cross-cutting implications. The urge to understand the latter was stimulated by my Foundation\u2019s activities on the Earth Care Awards We are also convinced about the need to \u201cgo beyond rhetoric and actually help mitigate and adapt\u201d. Accordingly, we will now work on threats arising due to unplanned development, ozone layer depletion and per capita emissions and strengthen resilience of our communities through location-specific research and management inputs.We are fortunate to have an eminent Jury for the Earth Care Awards as also for the process of helping some of the applicants as a follow-up to the awards function.I have a great regard for individuals and organizations that are propagating and making a difference. It is such a beautiful world and if each one of us does even a little bit to help, we can nurture our earth. In our fight against global warming, the key factor should be our ability to change ourselves and respect mother earth more than we respect our faulty developmental indices.Mahatma Gandhi once said, \u201cAs human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world as in being able to remake ourselves.\u201d It is clear that it is we who need to change and not the climate.

RPower will use mining equipment bought from Bucyrus, a Wisconsin company.\u000a\u000aAbout $400 million of the financing will be used to buy Bucyrus mining equipment, which will help support 1,000 jobs, said Bloomberg, a business and financial news service, quoting a statement from the bank.\u000a\u000aText messages to both the Exim bank and Bucyrus were not immediately returned.\u000a\u000aRPower's application for a loan guarantee was rejected in June by the bank, a federal government agency, because of environmental concerns.\u000a\u000aBut RPower came back with a proposal to set up a facility to generate 250 MW of electricity using clean renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThis greened the deal adequately enough for the bank to change its mind, and it approved a "preliminary review" of the project in July, pending a final review and approval, on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"We are pleased that Reliance is making this commitment to renewable energy, which allows us to sustain US jobs and promote both conventional and renewable energy exports," Exim Bank Chairman and President Fred P Hochberg had said in July.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental groups have opposed the project and alleged that it was cleared under political pressure.\u000a\u000aAbout the final approval, Pacific Environment said, "Sasan alone will be responsible for 26 to 27 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually - one fifth of all proposed coal fired power plants in the US combined."

a((VIt is still possible to defend the environment ministrys decision against Vedanta, given how damage to the environment falls under the category of unknown unknowns. But how do you explain the petroleum ministrys actions in case of the sale of Cairn Indias shares to the Vedanta group The ministry first began talking, through the usual method of leaks, of how Vedanta lacked oil exploration experience. Since that didnt fly, given that the operating company, Cairn Energy India Pty, wasnt changing hands, the ministry tried another tackasking oil PSUs like ONGC and OIL to launch a counter-offer, never mind that such moves make India look a bit like countries such as Venezuela. The latest, as this newspaper reported yesterday, is to take away concessions offered to attract firms like Cairn when they first came inyoure making profits from India, the logic goes, so were going to reduce these. Given that ONGC will have to pay Rs 12,000 crore of royalty on behalf of Cairn by 2020it will rise if, as is likely, oil prices rise beyond $60the proposal seems pretty fair.\u000a\u000aThe problem with the proposal, however, is manifold. For one, since the government wanted to attract investment, it said that PSU oil firms like ONGC would pay the royalty and cess on behalf of their private sector partners. So, how do you take back a promise that brought in investors If this is done, expect some law suits. Second, why is the proposal to withdraw this concession aimed only at foreign players like Cairn Surely the same, though bad in law, should apply to Indian firms that are also getting ONGC/OIL to pay their share of royaltiesthe list includes some of the best in the business. Nor was the deal as unfair as it may seem. At the time, ONGC and OIL were not able to explore new fields at the pace the government wanted. So, it invited private sector players. Since it was not certain any oil or gas would be discovered, the private firms were supposed to pay for the exploration while ONGC/OIL took care of payments to the government. And for their contribution, ONGC/OIL got a share in the exploration blocks, as in Cairn. You could argue that the royalty payments by ONGC wouldnt be much higher than the amounts it will earn as a 30% partner in Cairn. That may be true, but this was a risk both ONGC and the private firms took. And, as the note prepared by ONGC for the Kirit Parikh expert group makes clear, it was always understood the government would make good this lossindeed, a Committee of Secretaries and a Group of Ministers even made this recommendation in 1997-98. So the government is actually trying to get the foreign oil companies to honour its commitment. Thats both bad news and bad in law.

a((VPanel protection Ranchi, Aug. 26: For the first time since Jharkhand came into existence 10 years ago, the state has taken an earnest step towards constituting an expert appraisal committee and an enforcing agency/authority to look into the possible impact of mining, industry and other non-forest activity on the environment. A proposal to this effect was sent to the Union ministry of environment and forests by the state forest and environment department recently. Principal chief conservator of forests (wasteland development board) C.R. Sahay said the state is now awaiting clearance from the Union ministry. Sahay, who is also chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB), said any non-forestry work, including mining either in forest or non-forest areas, will be cleared by the committee/authority if the total area concerned is less than five hectares. Such proposals would be appraised by the committee while consent to start the project would be given by a state environmental impact assessment agency/authority, provided norms are followed. State forest secretary A.K. Sarkar said the committee’s role would be to assess the impact of proposed non-forest activities on the local flora and fauna. Sources said such a committee and agency/authority exists in a majority of states, but a laggard administration in Jharkhand did little to set them up here. This has resulted in rampant illegal mining of precious minerals like bauxite and iron ore in Lohardaga, Latehar, Gumla and West Singhbhum, among other districts. Recently, in the absence of such a committee and agency/authority, the state administration referred the forest diversion proposal of Congress MP Naveen Jindal-owned Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) directly to the Union ministry without doing the groundwork. Sarkar said the committee would have 10 to 12 members, who would be experts in the field of flora, fauna, environment and forests. It will be headed by an official of the rank of principal chief conservator of forests. Any proposal cleared by the committee and agency/authority at the state level would be then looked into by similar authorities at the central level. The latter would have the final say for clearing big mining/industrial projects.

a((VThe Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) will organise a workshop on advances in science of climate change and Indian monsoon on August 31-September 1. The programme is being jointly organised by Centre for Climate Change Research and IITM.\u000a\u000aAlthough it is realised that increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases over the last century has led to significant rise in the global mean surface temperature of the earth, there are several uncertainties in understanding climate change and its impact at regional levels.\u000a\u000aIn particular future projections of the South Asian monsoon rainfall, based on the various models, exhibit a wide range of variations and uncertainties. Such uncertainties pose huge limitations in policy making for meeting the demands of adaptation to climate change. Moreover, since climate variability and change exert significant influence on society and natural environments, with consequent impacts on agriculture, water-resources, health, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, energy, industry and various sectors, it is important to address the scientific challenges of regional climate change based on a multidisciplinary and integrated approach. Keeping this in view, the two-day workshop will be held under the auspices of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India and the CCCR, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.\u000a\u000aThis workshop is a follow up of a similar workshop that was organised by MoES/IITM last year and the focus of this particular workshop is to address science issues related to regional climate change. In subsequent workshops, the focus on issues such as impacts, adaptation and mitigation will be addressed.\u000a\u000aThe major objective of this workshop is to take stock of the current scientific knowledge in regional climate change, identify gaps and chalk out directions for addressing these issues. While contributions made by the various MoES institutions on these issues will be highlighted, several top experts on climate science in the country have also been invited to offer their insights on the issues. In particular, one of the primary challenges is to build human capacity in Earth System Modeling (ESM) in the country - which is essential for providing reliable scientific inputs for policy and decision making on climate change issues.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Jan 31 deadline looms, those without Aadhaar ID will have to pay market price for LPG\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

Being a party,India is required to furnish information on the implementation of convention in the form of national communication report. The country has been divided into various zones. Once all the zones are done with their researches,the results will be sent to the Ministry of Environment and Forest which would send the collective report to the UNFCCC.\u000a\u000aApart from SIG,other institutes which are part of the survey are National Remote Sensing Centre,Indian Institute of Remote Sensing,International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT),Hyderabad,and Ministry of Environment and Forest. Speaking about the work being done in the project,Dr Singh,who is the principal investigator for the three states,said,“This project holds a lot of importance in determining and predicting future patterns of changes of the environment. The first phase of the project in which we had to find out what kind of changes have taken place in the forests,wetlands and grasslands of these areas,is almost coming to an end.”\u000a\u000aIn the second phase of the project,the various institutes will work on finding out what can be done to minimise the changes. “In the first phase,we came across some alarming results. The vegetation in the border areas of all the three states and the forest patterns have changed within a time span of 10 years. There has been massive deforestation in many areas. Almost 8.7% forests have undergone a major change where many endangered plant species are getting lost. Hence in the second phase,we will try to narrow down the research and concentrate on the reasons as to why the number of particular plant in a forest has declined,” said Singh.\u000a\u000aAnother task of the project is to estimate carbon stocks and emissions and removal of greenhouse gases associated with land use,land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities.\u000a\u000a“The primary importance of the project is that the changing patterns of the nation over the period of ten years will be clear,based on which we can predict changes that might take place in the coming years. The river basins and courses are changing,glaciers are melting leading to the rise in the sea-level. This study can be an effective tool to control climate change,” said Singh.\u000a\u000aThe meeting to discuss the plans for the second phase will take place in the month of September. “After the meeting,the work on the second phase will be started early next year. We have great hopes from the outcomes of the project based on our findings,the government can formulate future policies related to forests.”\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App

When I make films on climate change, I like to pick on aspects that nobody has heard of and therefore unable to judge its impact on their lives," says Jodha.\u000a\u000aHis film, The Weeping Apple Tree, that documents the adverse effects of climate change, is currently being screened at eight cities including Port Blair, as part of a travelling environment film festival.

a((VDuring the passage of the Nuclear Liability Bill, the Prime Minister pointed out that India had to retain the option of using nuclear power as a source of energy. Put it this way, the use of civilian nuclear energy is a just in case option. Yet the scale of commitment and the impending plans for setting up reactors with French, US and Russian suppliers seem to indicate a much greater reliance on nuclear power than a just in case role.\u000a\u000aCivilian nuclear power was used to sell the strategic alliance with the US in the Bush-Singh deal. Of course, neither side named it as such. But here too there is a just in case angle where the scenarios are China-centred. Yet that in itself does not prove the case for nuclear energy. Nuclear power generated energy is not cheap and it would be appropriate for any long-run planning to be clear about the cost price at which the supply would be forthcoming. Having just got rid of the middle-class subsidy for petroleum, the government would be well advised to desist from embarking on another horrendous expense.\u000a\u000aAfter an early promise in the 1950s, nuclear energy flopped as a source of cheap electric power. The US had its big wake-up call in the Three Mile Island accident. Britain was enthusiastic about nuclear power and had several reactors built. Eventually when there was a move to privatise the nuclear power sector in the 1990s, it emerged that there were no buyers because the cost of supplying power to consumers made nuclear power a bad option. At the time, the UK government invited tenders for privatisation, it was already giving a billion-pound subsidy to make it viable.\u000a\u000aNuclear power has won new friends on the grounds that it is clean. Yet we need to know the price of carbon at which, even if it is clean, the source will be economical. I predict that the price of carbon required to make nuclear power feasible is much higher than any found in the carbon market thus far. Only the EU has experimented with this and it has consistently under-priced carbon. Copenhagen further undermined any case for a high carbon price.\u000a\u000aThe Nuclear Liability Bill focuses on accidents. Even if the probability is very low, the damage will have such high costs that the expected value of such an event is not negligible. This is so not only within the vicinity of the reactor but also far away. The effects of Chernobyl were felt up to the Atlantic coast, i.e., every country between Ukraine and Wales was affected by the radiation released.\u000a\u000aBut even more than that, the larger cost of nuclear power is of disposal of waste. The waste is toxic and has a half-life running into centuries. In the UK and the US, attempts to get local communities to agree to have facilities for burial of the waste have proved to be very controversial. The economic cost of storage of toxic waste, in ways that are completely safe, has to be faced openly. Any escape of the waste will have devastating consequences for which the expected value is difficult to compute.\u000a\u000aThere are, of course, alternatives. Oil is too frequently dismissed as being likely to run out or costing too much. I have lived with stories of oil running out for 40 years at least. Oil was cheaper in real terms compared to 1979 even when two years ago it was $140. Every week we hear of yet another oil find; the latest being Cairns in the K-G basin. Brazil and Ghana are on the map of oil producing countries that were not there 10 years ago. The hydrocarbons supply is assured for decades ahead.\u000a\u000aThere are alternative sources such as wind power, solar energy and biofuel. These are always dismissed as too small or too expensive. Solar energy is a curious step-child. I recall Panditji enthusing about solar cookers in the 1950s. There are many countries investing in solar energy, not just China.\u000a\u000aJairam Ramesh has been quoted recently as arguing that biofuel competes with agricultural land. If so, the price at which land is sold to biofuel industries should reflect this opportunity cost. It is not that all agricultural land must be preserved for food production. India needs high productivity in agricultural land, not just any old land. Even so, Indias energy policy is so bizarre that Andhra Pradesh has biofuel supplying companies it chooses to tax at 22.5%, in addition to all the other taxes biofuel pays when it is mixed with diesel. With that sort of muddle it would be easy to price biofuel out of India. Has anyone asked Andhra Pradesh about the logic of its policy\u000a\u000aIs there any logic at all in Indias energy policy\u000a\u000aThe author is a prominent economist and Labour peer

a((VOcean research in the country is all set to get a boost with the deployment of electronics and high computing IT solutions, thus joining the bandwagon of developed countries. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune will be facilitating high-end research to enhance quality adoption of high performance computing (HPC) in the field of oceanography. One of the core areas of C-DACs expertise includes HPC including scientific modeling and visualisation, executing real time oceanography and climatology applications.\u000a\u000aWhile experts are pondering over climate change, expansion of deserts and warning of the earth which may have been caused by destruction of global environment, new researches point out that this may be due to an upset balance in heat and matters in the interactions between atmosphere and ocean. An ocean simulation model is perhaps the need of the hour.\u000a\u000aUnderstanding this, C-DAC has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Hyderabad-based Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) to collaborate in the areas of high performance computing for production grade environments. The objective is to provide C-DACs technological and professional services in HPC domain to INCOIS for a period of three years.\u000a\u000aINCOIS is an autonomous institute under the ministry of earth sciences which provides ocean information and advisory services to the society, industry, government and scientific community through sustained ocean observations and constant improvement by means of systematic and focused research. Confluence of ocean science, ocean observing systems and IT is vital to the realisation of this mission.\u000a\u000aAt a core level, C-DAC and INCOIS intend to jointly accelerate R&D activities to address large scale challenges in the frontiers of oceanography. The strategic association will catalyse the usage and enhance quality adoption of high performance computing in field of oceanography, says Goldi Misra, Group coordinator and head, HPC Solutions Group, C-DAC.\u000a\u000aOceans control weather and climate and thus considerably influence the environment. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides and other mass movements, meteorite ocean impacts or similar impact events and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami.\u000a\u000aC-DAC will facilitate INCOIS in the optimisation and parallelisation of models of this nature to make them capable for real-time predictions,\u000a\u000aMisra explains. Incidentally, INCOIS has established a tsunami early warning centre with the necessary computational and communication infrastructure that enables reception of real-time data from all the sensors, analysis of the data, generation and dissemination of tsunami advisories following a standard operating procedure.\u000a\u000aA number of widely-used oceanographic application models such as ROMS, MOM and CUPOM are being used along with in-house developed systems to study and understand ocean and climate, coastal ocean, hazardous weather events, observations, ocean data assimilation.\u000a\u000aIncidentally, C-DAC along with the ministry of earth sciences has been exploring the possibility of collaboration to look at problems faced in the weather and climate modeling. Recently, an agreement was signed between C-DAC and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) in Noida for implementation of Param supercomputing system for regional forecasts and mountain meteorology. A collaborative project by C-DAC and NCMRWF was initiated under this agreement to set up Param Padma supercomputer with C-DACs indigenously developed high speed low latency interconnect PARAMNet 2 based research facility for conducting studies in climate models. It would facilitate in indigenously developed hardware, operating environments, parallel ecosystems application specific predictive models in a cost-effective manner.\u000a\u000aContinuing the association with the ministry along with its weather forecasting domain, C-DACs collaboration with INCOIS will help in upgradation of existing LAN/WAN infrastructure, advanced security audit, disaster recovery, designing and implementing the security policy for INCOIS and exploring usage of large scale system for solving challenge problems in oceans.

a((VOn Thursday, some of the America's most respected environmental groups in the midst of their biggest political fight in two decades sent a group of activists to Milwaukee with a message \u2014 We're losing. They have come to bitter realisation: When we fight the oil and gas industry, they win.\u000a\u000aA year ago, these groups seemed to be at the peak of their influence, needing only the Senate's approval for a landmark climate-change bill. But they lost that fight.\u000a\u000aNow the groups are wondering how they can keep this loss from becoming a rout as their opponents press their advantage and try to undo the Obama administration's climate efforts. At two events last week in Wisconsin, environmental groups seemed to be trying two strategies: defiance and pleading for sympathy.\u000a\u000aNeither one drew enough people to fill a high school gym. "Our side did absolutely everything you're supposed to do but got nowhere," said author Bill McKibben. Washington's climate battle is still far from over. The Environmental Protection Agency is setting limits on some sources of greenhouse gases. Now, industry groups and senators from coal-producing states are trying to prevent that.\u000a\u000aEven in the hottest year on record, even with a historic Gulf oil spill, even with a Democratic Congress and a friendly White House, they couldn't win the fight it had picked. In fact, in the Senate it couldn't even start.\u000a\u000aIn exclusive partnership with The Washington Post. For additional content please visit www. washingtonpost.com

a((VNearly 5 million people in the Sunderbans and other places along the 250-km coastline forced to abandon their homes. Largescale casualties in Darjeeling as residents fall pray to malaria and dengue . Extreme weather conditions and water scarcity in Ganga affects crop production. The lean flow of the Hooghly hits operations at Haldia.These are some of the grim predictions made by scientists in the state's climate change action plan framework. The report also outlines broad adaptation and mitigation strategies, calling for a robust climate change information management system ( CCIMS ) for collating different climate change-related data and observations; preparation of a state-level inventory of GHG emission that covers various sectors; and tailoring land use planning according to the area's long-term climate forecast.This framework report, considered a vital document for mainstreaming climate in the state's planning process, was prepared nearly a year ago but has been gathering dust since."After the Centre published a national action plan on climate change, several states began to prepare their own documents. The CM was keen on identifying the impact of climate change on livelihood sectors," said an environment department official.Since Bengal was identified as extremely vulnerable to global warming and sea-level rise, the sub-committee on climate change took up the job after a meeting on April 22, 2008. Chief scientist Dipak Chakraborty, environmental engineer Dipanjana Maulik and scientist Debanjan Gupta were entrusted with the task. They had the document ready in six months, but it hasn't yet found any takers."Till now, the climate predictions and projections are predominantly available at global level. The scientific community throughout the world is working for downscaling the results into regional or local level to identify threats and chalk out adaptation and mitigation measures. The framework is the first crucial step in downscaling the IPCC report and is a crucial document that has to be detailed out to prepare a state-level policy and action plan," said a scientist involved in the project.In the framework, effects of global warming and climate change and their resultant impacts in health, water resource, agriculture, livelihood, economic growth and sustainability in Bengal are outlined.The rise in temperature is projected to widen the transmission window of many vector species like malaria and dengue mosquitoes due to extension of warmer and more humid periods. The people living in the Hills, so far not exposed to vector-borne diseases, may become more susceptible due to lack of inherent immunity.Scarcity of food grains due to climate change may also increase cases of malnutrition and make a large population more susceptible to diseases.Melting of Himalayan glaciers will initially cause flooding of the Gangetic plains; then, the river's flow will become lean, triggering a water crisis in the region. "Scarcity of water and increase of extreme events in Haldia, the state's industrial hub, can jolt the entire development process," the framework report warns."The forest and biodiversity may also change drastically over a short time span as the climate becomes inhabitable for certain species. This will disrupt the food chain. Loss of forest barrier in the Sunderbans will multiply the susceptibility to storm surges and cyclones," the report stated.Rise in sea level will pose major socio-economic challenges as well. People living along the coastline will be forced to migrate as the land gets inundated. Displacement of a huge population in Bangladesh will also have a ripple effect on Bengal."Bengal has to make modifications in its policy to make it climate-proof and robust enough to endure the severe impacts of climate changes," reasoned a scientist.

a((VNew Delhi, Aug. 30: An international review has urged “fundamental reform” in the management of the UN climate change agency that sparked controversy last year after, among other things, revelations that its predictions about Himalayan glaciers were unsubstantiated.\u000a\u000aThe Inter-Academy Council (IAC), an organisation of the world’s science academies, has called for greater scrutiny, improved procedures and changes in the leadership structure of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which is chaired by India’s Rajendra Pachauri.\u000a\u000aPachauri himself and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon had requested the IAC review in March 2010 after mounting controversy over several issues, including disclosures that the IPCC forecasts on climate change may have contained unsubstantiated claims that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by the year 2030.\u000a\u000a“We were eager for a thorough examination. Our credibility had been challenged, and we realised that only an exhaustive, impartial, independent review would be acceptable,” Pachauri said today at the UN in New York, after the release of the IAC report. “We were prepared to accept whatever results were forthcoming.”\u000a\u000aThe Himalayan glaciers problem arose after some IPCC authors tasked with reviewing scientific literature on the glaciers picked up material from non-scientific sources — so-called grey literature, non-peer-reviewed material — and included them in climate change assessment reports.\u000a\u000aThe IAC has said the current IPCC guidelines for inclusion of such non-peer-reviewed material are “vague” and need to be made more specific. It has recommended that such material be appropriately flagged in its periodic assessment reports.

a((VThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose workings were probed in a report published in New York on Monday, is the top scientific authority on global warming.\u000a\u000aSet up in 1988 by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC comprises around 3,000 atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, ice specialists, economists, public-health specialists and other experts.\u000a\u000aTheir task is to give policymakers a neutral and balanced update, known as an assessment report, of the latest knowledge about climate change and its impacts.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC comprises three working groups of men and women, nominated by governments and international organisations, whose full-time job is usually at research institutes and universities.\u000a\u000aThey trawl through thousands of peer-reviewed and published literature and summarise these findings; the IPCC does not conduct research of its own.\u000a\u000aWorking Group 1 deals with the pure scientific evidence for global warming and its effect on climate; Working Group 2, with the impacts of climate change; and Working Group 3, with how to tackle the problem.\u000a\u000aEach group submits a draft summary that undergoes a two-stage review by outside assessors and governments. The document is then submitted to a plenary, when it can be vetted line-by-line or even word-by-word before the final version is approved by consensus.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC proudly describes it as the biggest and most frequently updated peer-review process in the world, although it has also been criticised for being cumbersome and outmoded in its working methods.\u000a\u000aThe 938-page Fourth Assessment Report, which appeared in 2007, gave the most emphatic warning yet about the threat from greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aThe shock unleashed political momentum that culminated in the December 2009 Copenhagen Summit, attended by more than 120 leaders in the search for a post-2012 pact on greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aThe conference was the biggest summit in UN history, although it veered close to fiasco.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC, meanwhile, shot to fame. It won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize; along with former US vice president Al Gore, and its chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, supped with heads of state and shook the hands of rock stars and Hollywood actors.\u000a\u000aBut the panel's rise, and Pachauri's management style, also earned it closer scrutiny, especially from climate skeptics and fossil-fuel lobbyists.\u000a\u000aFirst came "Climategate," or the assertion, derived from intercepted emails from among key British scientists, that evidence had been skewed in favour of alarm.\u000a\u000aThe scientists were cleared by a parliamentary inquiry and an independent review, but they were also criticised for lacking openness towards public requests for information.\u000a\u000aThen came potentially far more damaging criticism on the grounds of accuracy and working methods.\u000a\u000aWorking Group 2's section in the Fourth Assessment Report was found to have erroneously predicted Himalayan glaciers, which provide water to a billion people, could be lost by 2035.\u000a\u000aThe reference was found to have come from a press article, not from a scientific journal, a mistake the IPCC has admitted.

Previously he has penned short stories,poetry and even essays,but they were written originally in Gujarati.\u000a\u000aTitled “Convenient Action: Gujarat’s Response to Challenges of Climate Change,” the book primarily focuses on how Gujarat has responded to the challenges of climate change — the biggest challenge to the world at present.\u000a\u000aThe state government claims to be the only provincial government in the Sub-Continent to have a dedicated climate change department.\u000a\u000aTo be released on December 21 in the presence of Kalam,it will be CM’s first book in English\u000a\u000aThe book launch invite calls it a “green autobiography” by one of the reviewers — Steve Howard. “The fact that the Gujarat government has gone ahead and set up its own full-fledged department of climate change is a clear declaration of intent and shows that the actions have been well-planned and thought through,” reads Howard’s comments.\u000a\u000aThe book runs into 250 pages with lots of photos,charts and texts in four colours. It is published by Macmillan Publishers India Limited and is available in both hardback and paperback.\u000a\u000aThe book is yet to be available in the market,but senior executives at Macmillan say the book discusses in great detail the water resources and pollution and how the state government has taken pro-active action to meet the challenges of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe book contains all recent unpublished data on climate change in original form. Modi is the “most progressive CM” as he chose to write on an issue concerning the society at large rather than his own life,the official said. Modi’s book release,he added,will be the company’s biggest ever launch in India.\u000a\u000aAsked why the chief minister chose Macmillan over any other publishing house,the official said Macmillan is India’s oldest publication house and has operations all over the world,which will give international visibility to the book. “That is why Modi probably chose Macmillan,” he said.\u000a\u000aIncidentally,Modi is the second politician after former US Vice-President Al Gore to write a book on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe book will be released on December 21 at a function to be presided over by former President APJ Abdul Kalam.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aCutting carbon emissions: Scores of rich countries made pledges over the last year to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 under the Copenhagen accord but they were not incorporated in the official UN process. Cancun now formally puts those pledges into UN documentation, although they may increase or decrease in future.\u000a\u000aFor the first time, developing countries also agreed to look at how they can cut emissions in the future \u2014 but did not make specific pledges.\u000a\u000aCrucially however, none of the cuts are legally binding. Climate aid: A new climate green fund was agreed at Cancun to transfer money from the developed to developing world to tackle the impacts of climate change. Poorer countries saw this as a success because they will outnumber rich countries on a supervisory panel for the fund, which is due to be set up in 2011. But no figure was put on how much money will go into it.\u000a\u000aSeparately, ministers repeated their political promise made last year at Copenhagen to raise $100bn in climate aid by 2020, starting with $30bn by 2012 for \u201cfast track\u201d financing.\u000a\u000aForests\u000a\u000aFormal backing was given for the UN's deforestation scheme, Redd (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation), under which rich countries pay poorer nations not to chop down forests and so lock away carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aBut details on when and exactly what form the scheme will take \u2014 particularly whether developed countries will be able to use it to \u201coffset\u201d their emissions rather than make cuts at home \u2014 are still vague.\u000a\u000aKyoto protocol: Decisions on the future of the Kyoto protocol, the current international treaty binding rich countries to cut emissions, were effectively deferred until South Africa next year. Whether countries will sign up for a second \u201ccommitment period\u201d to cuts beyond 2012 remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aDecisions on the role that the protocol will play in an ultimate future legal document that binds the world's countries to emissions cuts \u2014 the \u201choly grail\u201d of the UN negotiations \u2014 were delayed.\u000a\u000aTechnology transfer\u000a\u000aThe idea of transferring knowledge of clean technology between countries was backed at Cancun. A technology executive committee and a climate technology centre and network are to be set up, but there are no details on the money, where they will be based, when or by whom.\u000a\u000aCountries agreed to the principle of having their emissions cuts inspected. Such \u201cmonitoring, reporting and verification\u201d will depend on the size of the country's economy, though who will carry out the inspections was not specified. \u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

Pachauri has asked the coastal states to fix their infrastructure and programmes to meet the sea level rise, a phenomenon that he says is likely to continue for centuries.\u000a\u000aDr. Pachauri said the sea level rise cannot be controlled now with the measures like reduction in emission of green house because the inertia has set in the climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cInertia in the system will let sea level rise to continue not only for decades but for centuries,\u201d Dr. Pachauri said on Wednesday addressing a lecture in the memory of renowned Goan industrialist Vasudeva V Sinai Dempo.\u000a\u000aIPCC chief, who also is a Director General on The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said the states like Goa should pull up their sleeves to face the after effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aHe said the state needs to work out modalities to protect \u2019low lying and fragile areas\u2019, which are likely to get affected due to sea level rise.\u000a\u000aInsisting that the \u2018zoning laws\u2019 needs to be properly enforced, Dr. Pachauri said this will help to save lives and properties of the people.\u000a\u000aDr. Pachauri said that excessive tourism, mining and shipping industry has left its footprints on state like Goa.\u000a\u000aHe claimed that these kinds of industries have lot of externalities.\u000a\u000a\u201cGoa having a fragile environment is subjected to large amount of tourism. Therefore anything can happen over the years,\u201d he said adding that state government needs to look at impact of this industry in totality.\u000a\u000aIPCC chief said that Goa needs to do detailed assessment of what sea level rise can do for the state, which is geographically small.\u000a\u000aCiting the floods that hit state\u2019s southernmost Canacona taluka in October last year, Pachauri said that climate changes has resulted in the extreme events.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe frequency of floods and droughts is going to be increased in the years to come,\u201d he said adding the states should be ready to face the crucial issue of water management.\u000a\u000aThe internationally famed scientist appealed the governments to have a re-look at their economic growths.\u000a\u000aHe said the model like Bhutan where GDP is replaced with Gross National Happiness (GNH) should be emulated by nations.

The MoU is not about sharing or transfer of technology, but would only set up a platform where the two countries can discuss and explore the technologies that can be beneficial to both of them.\u000a\u000aThe MoU has personal backing of the Prime Minister who is keen to see the close cooperation between the two countries on climate change grow further. In view of the importance of the MoU, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh was able to get the consent of the Cabinet earlier this week despite the fact that the proposal could not be circulated to all the relevant ministries because of paucity of time. Foreign Minister S M Krishna had joined Jairam in explaining to the Cabinet the urgency of the matter.\u000a\u000aThe common positions of the two countries on climate change negotiations was reflected in the joint statement as well, wherein they emphasised the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" in dealing with climate change.

a((VLet\u2019s assess the outcome of Cancun in terms of what the world has achieved to avert climate change . We know the threat of a changing climate is real, we in India are most vulnerable and the world needs drastic emission reduction . Just think: to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, global emissions must drop to 44 billion tonnes of CO2e (all greenhouse gases) by 2020. The world is already emitting 48 billion tonnes of CO2e. This literally means it has run out of time and space to pollute.The first agenda before Cancun was to decide on how much the industrialized countries \u2013 primarily responsible for this global problem \u2013 would cut. The target discussed at the Bali conference in 2007 was a reduction of 40% over 1990 levels by 2020. So, tough decisions were needed at Cancun.The Cancun deal has been struck by letting these countries off the hook. There are no targets. Instead, it has been agreed that now these countries will take action based on what they \u201cpledge\u201d to do. Take the US. If the target was being set (as was decided in Bali) on the basis of its contribution to the stock of gases already in the atmosphere, then it would have to reduce 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. Now, US has \u201cpledged\u201d that it will reduce zero percentage points in the same period. Cancun legitimizes its right to pollute. It is no wonder that it worked hard to stitch the deal. It is no wonder that western media and leaders are ecstatic about the breakthrough. It is their victory.What Cancun has done is to shift the burden of the transition to the developing countries. If the combined pledges of the developed world are compared to those of the developing (including India\u2019s commitment to reduce energy intensity by 20% by 2020) then the sell-out character of the deal becomes clear. The industrialized countries, who till now were being asked to take on the burden, will end up cutting less emissions than the developing world. They cut roughly 0.8-1.8 billion tonnes, against developing country pledges of 2.8 billion tonnes.Even worse, Cancun fails to even address the challenge of climate change. With the deal in force, the world is being put on course for a 3-4 degrees C temperature increase. We know that we are most hit by a changing climate - our monsoon, our lifeline is expected to get more extreme and more variable. With just 0.7 degrees C increase in global temperature, we are seeing signs of present and future danger. So, how can we even begin to celebrate this non-deal?The second agenda was to decide on the mitigation actions of the developing countries and how these would be supported with funds and technology. The deal is worse than nothing on these counts. In the case of money, the old amounts have been repeated \u2013 some $30 billion by 2012 and $100 billion by 2020. But as no new or additional funds have been made available till now and there is open talk about recession in the rich world, this is not even a promise to keep. It is bribe to cajole but not to pay.In technology, where the issue concerned access to clean technology on preferential terms, the deal avoids mention of the contentious word of IPR and pretends all is well because it has small talk about setting up global centres of technology.The Cancun deal is by and for the rich polluters of the world. It does nothing to avert climate change and instead sets up a weak framework for action against pollution. And because it dumps the principle of equity, it negates our right to development.But then we hate being hated in the rich man's world. It is better if we deal for them. This way we can feted as dealmakers. It is another matter that we get nothing for everything we give up.(The author is director of Centre for Science and Environment)

a((VHave the Cancun Agreements set Kyoto Protocol on a path to eventual death? No. Killing Kyoto would require a 2/3rd vote by the 180-plus member countries. There is too much guilt involved in that. But the Agreements have prepared the ground to render the Protocol hollow and meaningless - left to survive a vegetative, inconsequential life even as a new and unequal global regime takes ground.The Kyoto Protocol was agreed to on a historical premise and the need for making emission targets under it stronger, built on a scientific one. The developed countries had for more than a century occupied the atmospheric space \u2013 and therefore the space for economic development \u2013 far beyond their equitable share. Kyoto set them emission reduction targets to diminish their hold on the atmosphere and give the developing countries the space to grow out of poverty.The need for stronger targets for the rich countries came with science showing that there was very little atmospheric capacity left to absorb more greenhouse gases and the rich countries had to take deeper cuts. Science showed the crisis was so deep that even after the rich countries took these deep cuts, the developing countries would have to pay in advance for their future acts \u2013 take steps to slow the growth of their future emissions.In 2007 at Bali, the developing world agreed to shoulder some responsibility and take voluntary actions to reduce their future emissions if the rich world enabled them with finance and technology. In 2009 at Copenhagen, the developing world accepted that they would not wait for the funds or technology to come from the reluctant rich countries. Now at Cancun, India has said it is willing to turn its voluntary domestic actions into international commitments.In contrast, over the same period, the developed countries at Bali indicated they would be willing to discuss Kyoto\u2019s future if the developing countries too were willing to consider new responsibilities. Then they took a step back and demanded developing countries must act first before Kyoto is even discussed. In Cancun, they simply refused to discuss the protocol but India was all too eager to make commitments regardless.If Kyoto Protocol\u2019s second commitment period had been agreed to, the following would have happened. All the rich countries, except for the US, would have undertaken deeper emission cuts (25-40% from 1990 levels). These countries would have kept the pressure on the US to also take comparable deep cuts under a new deal (US\u2019s stubborn refusal to accept Kyoto has become acceptable anyway). India and other large economies would have decided, based on their economic capacities, what actions they can take voluntarily to reduce their future emissions.Instead, this is what happened at Cancun. India helped broker a climate agreement where the developed countries got away with not taking commitments under Kyoto\u2019s second phase. Instead of demanding that developed countries commit to targets, the Cancun Agreements used the language of pleading \u2013 \u201curging\u201d them to raise their targets, and, list whatever targets they desire, on non-binding documents for information sake.Oddly, even as the rich countries were left off the hook, India agreed to inscribe its relative emission reductions on the same documents, taking on similar levels of international scrutiny. Effectively it ripped the differentiation between the historical emitters and the poor countries. Now everyone would need to only make voluntary pledges. Lip service was paid to climate science but the Cancun Agreements contained no strict provision to monitor and evaluate if the voluntary pledges of the rich countries are adequate enough to prevent dangerous climate change.Environment minister Jairam Ramesh went one step ahead and committed that India was willing to turn its voluntary actions into binding international commitments. While the rich world was shirking its commitments India became the eager beaver to take on the rich man\u2019s burden.Nothing wrong in being seen doing more than one\u2019s fair share to save the planet. But when the rich world was ready to live without regard for the planet or science, India forsook its earlier stance. That taking on commitments would shave off its economic growth. That it had a large number of poor which continued to live below global poverty levels without electricity and taking on emission reduction commitments would increase the cost of delivering power to the homes of the 400 million living without it at the moment. That it would reduce the resources at its disposal to elevate the poor out of darkness. That it required the atmospheric space to develop economically. That it had contributed only 2.2% of the global cumulative emissions while countries were way above (US contributed 29.3% and EU 26.5%) and that the burden must be in proportion to the contribution. That the rich countries needed to vacate theatmospheric space, permitting it and other poor countries to reach a level of economic health that it too could shift on to the substantially costlier clean technologies. That it would take actions to reduce its future emissions but at a pace it could bear the costs of. That it would retain the flexibility to amend these actions \u2013 upgrade or reduce the effort \u2013 based on the health of its economy.The sudden shift in stance, explained by the minister as merely \u201cnuancing\u201d, will entail costs that will continue long after the dust has settled at Cancun.Short-term green market economics apart, the potential strain on development is a worry.It was and remains well known that emission reduction efforts lead to increased costs of fossil fuels \u2013 coal and oil \u2013 both are the mainstay of Indian economy at the moment. Jairam Ramesh proposed the change to India\u2019s stance at the cabinet meeting just before Cancun. The UPA cabinet accepted his proposal. At Cancun, he announced the change in India\u2019s stance to the world. But the government is yet to explain to the country how India\u2019s economic conditions have changed to dramatically in two years that it can consider an inflexible international commitment, regardless of costs. They are yet to inform the country on why the government has decided to shun all its previous studies advising against such a move and offer itself for inflexible commitments. It is yet to explain why India is now prepared for an unequal world.India came back from Cancun with its negotiating space crunched and prepared to forsake its atmospheric space. It gave away too many cards too soon for too little.Everyone who has been part of the climate talks will admit off the record that in due time, as India\u2019s emissions increase, it will need to take on binding commitments of some nature. That it had to use its negotiating space to buy that time for the country\u2019s development even as it demanded reparation from the rich world to adapt to the inevitable climate change.Keeping Kyoto alive and keeping the pressure on the rich countries was part of that strategic economic interest embedded in the climate talks. Instead, India has now agreed to the Cancun Agreements that push it faster towards a new regime where its commitments increase while that of the rich world reduces.

a((VTibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama told a US envoy to India that "political agenda should be sidelined for five to 10 years and the international community should shift its focus to climate change...", according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks.\u000a\u000aThe Dalai Lama last year told the US Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer that the "political agenda should be sidelined for five to 10 years and the international community should shift its focus to climate change on the Tibetan plateau" during a meeting in Delhi, the Guardian reported on Friday.\u000a\u000a"Melting glaciers, deforestation and increasingly polluted water from mining projects were problems that 'cannot wait', but the Tibetans could wait five to 10 years for a political solution," he was quoted as saying.\u000a\u000aIn the cable sent to Washington regarding the meeting, Roemer said "the Dalai Lama's message may signal a broader shift in strategy to reframe the Tibet issue as an environmental concern".\u000a\u000aThe ambassador reported that the Dalai Lama criticised China's energy policy and said dam construction in Tibet had displaced thousands of people and left temples and monasteries underwater.\u000a\u000aHe suggested that Chinese authorities compensate Tibetans for disrupting their nomadic lifestyle with vocational training, and said there were "three poles" in danger of melting - the north pole, the south pole, and "the glaciers at the pole of Tibet", the Guardian reported.\u000a\u000aThe cables also show the appeals made by the Dalai Lama for intervention by the US during unrest in Tibet in 2008 and he pleaded with US officials to take action that would "make an impact" in Beijing.\u000a\u000aAnother cable said that at the end of a 30-minute meeting the Dalai Lama embraced the embassy's officials and "made a final plea".\u000a\u000a"Tibet is a dying nation. We need America's help," he was quoted as saying.\u000a\u000aOfficials repeatedly made the point that the Indian government's policy towards the Tibetans in exile is likely to be decided by public sentiment.\u000a\u000aIn a March 2008 cable, an official told Washington that Shivshankar Menon, current Indian national security adviser and then India's top diplomat, explained to the US ambassador that though "the Tibetan movement has the sympathy of the Indian public, and India has been a generally supportive home to tens of thousands of Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, for nearly 50 years... the tacit agreement that Tibetans are welcome in India as long as they don't cause problems is being challenged at a time when India's complex relationship with Beijing is churning with border issues, rivalry for regional influence, a growing economic interdependence, the nascent stages of joint military exercises, and numerous other priorities".\u000a\u000aThe US officials said that "while the (government of India) will never admit it", New Delhi's "balancing act with India's Tibetans (would) continue for the foreseeable future, with the caveat that a rise in violence - either by Tibetans here or by the Chinese security forces in Tibet - could quickly tip the balance in favour of the side with greater public support", the daily reported.

a((VJapanese MP Issei Tajima, member of an influential lobby of global parliamentarians called GLOBE (Global Legislators for a Balanced Environment) that had met at the Mexican Senate immediately preceding the recent climate change talks at Cancun, is happy that his opinion on allowing the private industry to enter into climate change financing and action has found its place in the\u000a\u000aSeveral clauses in the opens the door for inclusion in climate-alleviation financing and action.\u000a\u000aTajima had told the global lobby of MPs that the current crises in European and US financial markets, on world energy situation and global warming issues left \u201cparadigm shift to a green economy as the only solution forward\u201d.\u000a\u000aCancun has now formally agreed on a Green Fund, with promises of putting in $100 billion by 2020 and $30 billion by 2012, which is merely a continuation of what the previous talks at Copenhagen in December 2009 had committed, but had not honoured so far.\u000a\u000aThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had also previously committed 0.7 per cent of its GDP to funding adaptation in developing countries, but has not kept its commitment as yet, with many donor countries facing financial constraints.\u000a\u000aTajima said financial institutions, affected by conventional loan policies, were now looking at changing their investment policies. Thus, green products that had no short-term value were now proving good assets in the long term.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is why private financing is assuming a very important role,\u201d says Tajima, stressing however, that identification of \u2018green\u2019 industry for this was important. The industry should have low-carbon operations, adhere to national environmental pollution controls as well as safeguard natural and social impacts. Disclosure of its carbon emission risk and contribution should also be essential.\u000a\u000a\u201cFinancial institutions should help in constructing this new mechanism\u201d said Tajima.\u000a\u000a\u201cBanks need to develop environment products, services and information to be shared by other financial institutions while the government needs to improve the investment climate for the\u000a\u000a\u201cLong-term national strategies are crucial for the to enter this market with investment,\u201d he continued.\u000a\u000aPublic support, essential for private financing, could be through insurance or guarantee by public financial institutions for risk mitigation, or through co-financing public-private, together with international and local financing.\u000a\u000a\u201cTake the risk through medium and long term investment,\u201d Tajima advised developing country MPs at the GLOBE meeting. \u201cMedium-risk returns should be given to the private sector while the government takes the long-term risk.\u201d\u000a\u000aJapan, one of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient economies, will be fulfilling its Kyoto Protocol emission reduction targets within another year, and has set a further target of reductions.\u000a\u000aIt vetoed continuation of the Kyoto Protocol at Cancun, which ultimately got watered down to be decided in Durban next year, because of the refusal of both major economies like the US to come on board, and of emerging economies like China and Brazil to set higher emission reduction targets.\u000a\u000aGLOBE, which currently influences its nationals politicians behind the scenes at major trade and climate meetings, is now fighting for accreditation to the UNFCCC\u2019s climate process.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aNigel Lawson believes that a case can be made for the introduction of an across-the-board carbon tax, initially at a relatively low level, provided that the proceeds of the tax are fully returned to the pockets of the people by a reduction in other taxes such as income tax.\u000a\u000aIf the objective is seriously to reduce global emissions, it would need to be a consumer-based tax, since in the globalised world economy industry is highly mobile, whereas individuals are far less so, he elaborates, in \u2018 An Appeal to Reason \u2019 (www.harpercollins.co.in).\u000a\u000aPlucking the goose\u000a\u000aThe case for a carbon tax, says Lawson, is essentially twofold. First, \u2018the art of taxation is to pluck the goose so as to obtain the largest amount of feathers, with the smallest possible amount of hissing.\u2019\u000a\u000aHarking back to this insight of Colbert, the great seventeenth century reformer of the French tax system, the author confesses to having used this as the basis for \u2018high-sounding health arguments to justify raising substantial revenues from tobacco taxation, always taking care not to pitch the duty so high that too many people gave up smoking, causing the tax actually to diminish.\u2019 In the same way, if people like to feel that they are helping to save the planet by paying a carbon tax, they should not be deprived of the opportunity to do so, argues Lawson.\u000a\u000aThe only practical way\u000a\u000aSecondly, levying a carbon tax is the only practical way of getting an indication of what it might take to change behaviour sufficiently seriously to cut back on carbon-based energy consumption, the author notes. He avers that even if the damage done by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide is no greater than the economic and indeed human cost of forced decarbonisation, if the spirit of the age demands that something be done, if only as a gesture, to curb CO2 emissions, then a carbon tax imposed on a strictly revenue-neutral basis would do no great harm.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a good deal more than can be said for either a cap-and-trade system, which has been seen to be both undesirable in principle and a scam in practice, or the capriciously intrusive \u2018interventionist gimmickry\u2019\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aChange in behaviour needed\u000a\u000aA chapter titled \u2018The cost of mitigation\u2019 rues that \u2018feel-good measures in the western world\u2019 such as driving a hybrid car, abolition of plastic bags, and not leaving television sets on standby are trivial to the point of irrelevance considering the scale of the carbon dioxide cutback that is required.\u000a\u000aA key test, according to Lawson, is to consider how high a carbon tax would need to be in order to generate the necessary change in behaviour, both on the supply side and the demand side. On the demand side for energy, price-elasticity is not all that great, particularly so far as transport is concerned, he informs. \u201cThe price of oil has almost quintupled over the past six years, and the price of petrol at the pumps has risen substantially as a result, but this has had little effect on the amount we drive or on the speed at which we drive (despite the fact that slower speeds are significantly more economical).\u201d\u000a\u000aLeast-cost means\u000a\u000aHence the author postulates that the rise in the price of petrol needed to persuade us to use less, and rise in the cost of air fares (from a higher aviation fuel price) needed to persuade us to fly less, would have to be very large indeed.\u000a\u000aTo those who seriously wish to put in place a least-cost means of genuinely reducing carbon dioxide emissions, Lawson\u2019s prescription is to forget about the ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme), CDM (Clean Development Mechanism), CERs (Certified Emissions Reductions), JI (Joint Implementation) and all that and simply impose a carbon tax across the board. We already have a fully-functioning energy market, which taxation would make use of, he reasons.\u000a\u000aEducative study.\u000a\u000aBookPeek.blogspot.com

a((VNEW DELHI: Environment minister Jairam Ramesh might have been taken to task by the Opposition back home, but he has got a pat on his back from the US for the role he played over successive climate meets -- in Copenhagen last year and Cancun recently -- during negotiations, and helping broker the climate deal.The US appreciation of India's \u2018fundamental shift' in the stance at the controversial Copenhagen talks in 2009 and Ramesh's effort 'drawing India farther from the G77' has been revealed in a WikiLeak cable, dated February 2010, released on late Thursday night.Ramesh's role in brokering a deal in Cancun, on the other hand, won him plaudits from the US in public domain with the US special envoy Todd Stern recently pointing out in an interaction with media, "India really played a particularly constructive role in trying to find solutions that would bring everybody to the table. And one good example of that is on the issue of transparency, which was very important."While praising the dramatic shift in India's stance, the US seemed to have shifted the goal posts yet again. Todd Stern in the same media interaction said, "...we're not prepared to enter into legally binding commitments to reduce our emissions unless China, India, and so forth, are also prepared to do that."Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, India is not obliged to undertake any legally binding commitments but the developed world has been pushing to change that since 2007. So far, India had refused to take on any international commitments though it had, as per the convention, taken on responsibilities such as voluntary actions. But in Cancun, India made a dramatic U-turn with environment and forests minister making an unscripted intervention to state, "all countries should take on binding commitments under appropriate legal form".The US and other countries had, at least in public domain, only been talking of asking India and other emerging economies to take concrete voluntary actions to reduce their future emissions. UPA-II, too, had claimed that it was looking for binding commitments from the US as part of the new global deal and from other rich countries under the Kyoto Protocol. But the Cancun Agreements, that India played critical role in brokering, read along with the minister's unilateral proposals has altered that position radically.Going into Cancun, US had made international scrutiny of emerging economies its priority on the climate front. Ramesh had made a proposal despite lack of consensus within BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) on how to scrutinise India and other emerging economies' climate actions, part of which found their way into the Cancun Agreements.Stern appreciated Ramesh's role, saying, "India made a proposal that I think people fundamentally came around. The ultimate language wasn't exactly what India suggested, but it was really quite important that India did that."WikiLeak cable also showed that after the controversial Copenhagen Accord, US had noted, "The 16th Conference of Parties (COP-16) at Copenhagen marked a fundamental shift in India's climate change position," and "Ramesh has drawn India farther from the G77 by telling parliament India was not in the same category as other developing countries..."Post-Copenhagen, Ramesh had admitted to flexibility in the UPA's position on the climate negotiations, but in Cancun he called his dramatic U-turn as 'nauncing' India's position.

a((VFor those looking for lessons in Indian diplomacy, Cancun was a high-water point. The reason was Jairam Ramesh. The Mexicans found their mojo and India finally emerged as a climate winner. The UN climate conferences surprise outcome was not pre-determined. Two weeks ago, most scribes had written off the prospects of an agreementin keeping with a whole year of downplaying expectations. Copenhagen had handed Cancun a poisoned chalice. No one wanted a repeat of the stratospheric expectations, incoherent political process, murky last-minute deals and crushing results. Both trust and nerves had been shredded.\u000a\u000aThe Mexican hosts listenedthey promised an inclusive and transparent process, and delivered. The sustained applause, the multiple standing ovations that followed COP 16 President, Patricia Espinosa, as she gavelled through the agreement at 3:30am on December 10 were there for a reason. They were borne out of pure wonder, longing, pleasure and relief that the the battered climate process had rescued itself.\u000a\u000aThis is the emotional context in which Indias shifting position on climate must be seen. Negotiations are not just about hardball positions but about psychology, atmosphere and relationships. This is the backdrop against which a break with the past was made.\u000a\u000aThe truth is that Indias position has been evolving ever since Jairam Ramesh took office in May 2008. This is a good thing. From the acceptance of the\u000a\u000a2 degree limit at LAquila in 2008, to Rameshs imaginative proposals on technology, international consultation and analysis this year, to his consensus-building language on the legal form of the agreement in the last days of the Cancun conference, we have seen a steady evolution of the Indian position on climate change.\u000a\u000aRamesh has combined style with substance to bring new standing to India in the climate negotiations. He quickly understood the sticky issues around finance, monitoring and verification and worked hard to find solutions to release the pressure valves. He demonstrated that he had skin in the game and was willing to be a problem-solver and consensus builder. A refreshing change from the traditional role of India as long on pompous rhetoric and short on constructive action.\u000a\u000aThe UN climate negotiations are probably the most complex, technically demanding and politically charged. They are far-reaching in scope and the stakes could not be higher. But they have become ossified with negotiators unable to see the wood for the trees and incapable of mounting an effective collective response to the growing warnings of climate calamity. At root, this is because governments do not fully understood what their national interests are in terms of climate change. If they did, there would be less talk of national sovereignty and more of collective effort. India is a case in point.\u000a\u000aFor more than a decade, our policymakers acted as if climate change was somebody elses problem. The West was to blame and we were victims. In a neatly-ordered world, all we had to do was make strenuous demands for per capita equity as a populous third world nation, and we would deservedly get our fair share of global environmental space.\u000a\u000aIn the real world, the dialogue of the deaf in the UN climate negotiations continued and the poles began to melt faster. We kept doing the same thing and kept getting the same results. During this lost decade, we did not address the critical issue of our own domestic climate risks, impacts or resilience. We failed to give our industry a head start to prepare for a low-carbon competitive future, and we failed to address the adaptation needs of our poorest.\u000a\u000aNot because we couldnt have. But we chose not to. India has no shortage of wealth or entrepreneurialism. We have no dearth of intellectual, scientific or technological talent. We have a dearth of vision and belief in ourselves. Enter Jairam Ramesh. In one year, he has been a one-man motor of change with a lorryful of initiatives. We now have a pro-\u000a\u000aactive climate policy that addresses Indias risks while playing a constructive leadership role internationally. This is not for everyone. Indias climate politics are still dominated by the cold warriors. But Rameshs reforms have thumping resonance with youth and entrepreneurs keen on solutions.\u000a\u000aAt Cancun, Rameshs effectiveness lay in his skill in reading the political tea leaves. He realised moral authority now lay with the newly-assertive small island states and poorer nations. As the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, India had a responsibility to curb its own emissions. New alliances such as the Cartagena Dialogue had emerged, bringing together rich and poor nations on a shared progressive agenda challenging the old order.\u000a\u000aThe significance of these new alignments has been little remarked in the Indian media. As a result, political discussion is ill-informed and out of date. To appreciate Rameshs stance one has to understand the changed negotiating environment and expectations of India as a rising power. India emerged as a star at Cancun because of Ramesh. Effective diplomacy requires risk-taking. If we are to build on this, we will need better informed parliamentary and public discussion. Not just about domestic duties, but our international obligations as an emerging power in an interdependent world threatened by climate change. The good news is weve made a start.\u000a\u000aThe author is founder and chief\u000a\u000aexecutive, Centre for Social Markets

a((VUpdated: Tue, Dec 21 2010. 12 42 AM IST\u000a\u000aAs dust settles on the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held recently in Cancun, the takeaways from the summit have become the subject of an engaging debate. That the Cancun conference was able to deliver a set of agreements has prompted many commentators to hail this as a success of multilateralism. This accolade seems to have been influenced by the fact that, in the recent past, there have been few occasions when outcomes of multilateral negotiations have been received with as much applause as in Cancun.\u000a\u000aSo much for the form, the content of the Cancun agreements is at best a mixed bag. While the agreements have underlined the commitments of the world community to address the scourge of global warming, there are nuanced changes in the approach, reflected in the Long-term Cooperative Action (LCA) being adopted as the blue print for future implementation of UNFCCC. And, according to some commentators, the Kyoto Protocol, till now the only mechanism for effecting cuts in carbon dioxide emissions in the developed world (sans the US, which never ratified it), may be on its way out.\u000a\u000aIn broad terms, LCA is set on the principles of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d of the contracting parties of UNFCCC. These principles, the most distinctive feature of the UN framework, require advanced nations to bear the burden of adjustment for ushering in a low-carbon economy. The developed countries are required to vacate some \u201ccarbon space\u201d in the atmosphere, which would be needed by the developing countries to pursue their development objectives. This re-calibration of carbon dioxide emissions is imperative for ensuring that the increase in earth\u2019s temperature is kept within bounds, thus averting the risk to future generations arising from global warming. At the same time, developing countries would be able to undertake adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions if developed countries provided them with the financial resources and effect transfer of technology.\u000a\u000aAlthough LCA does not allude to developing countries making firm commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the mitigation actions they would take would be subjected to \u201cmeasurement, reporting and verification\u201d (MRV) in keeping with the guidelines to be developed under the convention. MRV would be for both internationally and nationally supported mitigation actions undertaken by parties to UNFCCC, including developing countries. Additionally, a process for international consultations and analysis (ICA) has been put in place, aimed at increasing \u201ctransparency of mitigation actions and their effects, through analysis by technical experts in consultation with the Party concerned...\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral commentators have interpreted MRV and ICA, mechanisms meant for developing countries, as ones that would deviate from the principles of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d on two counts. First, their implementation would require developing countries to establish reporting systems that are not only extensive, but can also stand up to scrutiny. A network of institutions may be required in order that this reporting system is effective.\u000a\u000aSecond, it has been pointed out that MRV and ICA are to be implemented by developing countries even as LCA remains stuck over commitments to financial resources or technology transfer made by developed countries. As regards the financial resources, the pledges made in the Copenhagen accord have been repeated. Thus, developed countries have made commitments \u201cto provide new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, approaching $30 billion for the period 2010-2012\u201d. In addition to this fund for short-term exigencies, the accord also included a long-term commitment by developed countries to provide, through a multi-stakeholder process, $100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries.\u000a\u000aTechnology transfer has been one of the most contested issues in the climate change negotiations, primarily because access to climate-friendly technologies is conditioned by the intellectual property rights (IPRs) used to protect such technologies. IPRs\u2019 role in restricting access to climate-friendly technologies has figured prominently in UNFCCC negotiations. Its significance is such that the Expert Group on Technology Transfer, established in 2001 with the aim to inter alia advance technology transfer activities, has produced a stocktaking paper on IPRs\u2019 role in transfers of technology. However, even before the findings of this paper were discussed, the Cancun conference took a decision to terminate the expert group and establish a technology mechanism mandated to take enhanced action on \u201ctechnology development and transfer\u201d to support mitigation and adaptation activities. What is perhaps more striking is that the mandate for the proposed technology mechanism glosses over the IPR dimension in its entirety.\u000a\u000aThe Kyoto Protocol has long been waiting to see whether its life would be extended beyond 2012\u2014 when the first phase of the protocol expires. The outcome of the Cancun conference evokes little confidence that a second phase of Kyoto will find many takers.\u000a\u000aBiswajit Dhar is director general at Research and Information System for Developing Countries, New Delhi.\u000a\u000aComments are welcome at theirview@livemint.com

a((VWind farms could harm crops\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile harnessing wind energy could satisfy growing demand for electricity and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, turbulence from wind turbines could affect the growth of surrounding crops, US researchers said. Led by atmospheric sciences professor at University of Illinois, Somnath Baidya Roy, the researchers suggest careful placement of wind farms. Roy had first described the local climate impact of wind farms in 2004. The study was based on models because little data on temperatures at wind farms was available in the public domain. In 2009, Roy met Neil Kelley, meteorologist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, who had collected temperature data at a wind farm in the foothills of the San Jacinto mountains in California for seven weeks in 1989.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRoy and his team analysed Kelley\u2019s data and found the area surrounding turbines was up to 3.5 degrees C cooler during the day and up to 0.61 degrees C warmer at night than the rest of the region. Turbulent mixing brings cold air down and takes warm air up, leading to a cooler surface and vice versa. This creates a stronger mixing of heat and moisture, which causes the land surface to become warmer and drier at night, the researcher noted in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This change can affect the growth of crops within the wind farm because warm temperature at night robs plants of moisture, Roy said. He proposed strategies to reduce the impact of wind turbines on local weather and thus the crops. Roy is mapping the wind\u2019s frictional dissipation around the world. It shows large parts of North and central America, southern tip of South America, northern Europe, Russia, northern China, the Rift Valley and southern parts of Africa and southern Australia are ideal for low-impact wind farms.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTiasa Adhya\u000a\u000aDown To Earth Feature Service\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPlants soak in 36 pc more VOCs than thought\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPlants soak more atmospheric pollutants than thought. A study by US scientists shows that apart from carbon dioxide, plants rid the air of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, the most abundant class of carbon-based chemicals in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAutomobile exhaust, coal burning and industry are some of the major sources of VOCs that cause respiratory diseases. \u201cVOCs also combine with oxygen to form tiny airborne particles called oxygenated VOCs, which insulate the atmosphere. Karl and his team measured the level of VOCs in the atmosphere at six different places across the North and South Americas representing different ecosystems. Three of them represented tropical rainforests and the others were temperate deciduous forest, mixed temperate forest and semi-arid shrub land.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScientists analysed field data and found, on an average, ecosystems across the globe absorb 36 per cent more VOCs than thought. The process occurs at an optimum rate in thick tropical forests and is the lowest in semi-arid shrub, the scientists noted in the Science Express, a few months back. The finding provides a platform for better climate models, Karl said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aManupriya\u000a\u000aDown To Earth Feature Service

a((VThe Kyoto Protocol is set to expire in 2012. Key developed countries appear unlikely to sign on to a new serious international agreement to reduce carbon emissions worldwide unless developing countries,many of whom are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases,are also engaged in the process. Developing countries argue,however,that growth is a priority,and that their emissions per capita are still much lower than in the West.\u000a\u000aIndia’s negotiating team at the Climate Change Conference in Cancun,Mexico has shown a way out of this deadlock. Jairam Ramesh’s proposal that,under the right conditions,India would allow verification of,and hard caps on carbon emissions,is a bold move that seeks to induce all other large polluting countries,including China,to agree to submit to a similar regime. The proposal requires that this must be accompanied by extensive handover of clean technologies — with the know-how for how to use and manufacture them — from rich to developing countries,a tremendous potential gain for numerous emerging markets. Some might question India’s proposal. How can it be right to ask countries that are now finally growing to put in place regulations that may inhibit this growth?\u000a\u000aFirst,India is likely to pay a high price for global inaction and deadlock in confronting climate change. State-of-the-art climate models predict that,if current trends in greenhouse gas emissions continue,India will have more than 100 extra days per year where temperatures exceed 32 degrees Celsius. As last summer’s heat wave demonstrated,high temperatures exact a toll in India. Research (by Greenstone) indicates that at these temperatures,mortality rates become substantially elevated,especially in rural areas. Further,these hot days reduce agricultural yields,lower wages,and lead to higher prices for consumers in rural areas. Climate change is also likely to lead to increased climate instability,and more episodes of destructive severe weather comparable to this year’s flooding in Pakistan.\u000a\u000aSecond,global coordination still remains the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — and India’s position could prove the necessary bridge between the key interests. It is striking that China,the world’s largest polluter,has so far proven unwilling to take action on this issue — but China may be more willing to act if other emerging markets also follow the same restrictions. The support for hard caps could assuage the concern by several key players in the negotiations — including the United States and Japan — that emerging markets’ emissions increases will undo any progress made in developed countries. These pieces appear essential for rich countries to produce the resources necessary to help poorer countries cope with the costs of reducing emissions and of adapting to climate change.\u000a\u000aThird,the pledge of verification and caps will pave the way for creating a global emissions reduction target. This would be a promising development for India,because it would lay the foundation for a robust global trading market for carbon from which India would be poised to benefit economically. Specifically,developed countries would look for opportunities in India to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and would pay for those opportunities. This would generate a flow of money for India’s businesses and citizens,as well as encourage modern,clean energy investments in India. This would be a welcome replacement to Kyoto’s Clean Development Mechanism that has thus far provided India with 81 million certified emission reduction (CER) credits but whose future is threatened by legitimate concerns about the validity of the claimed reductions.\u000a\u000aClimate change is a real threat to the global economy,to vulnerable populations,and to the world’s natural resources. This is especially so in India where many still live in rural areas,the economy is heavily dependent on the climate,and the temperatures are already high. India’s leadership at Cancun was bold,farsighted and politically,economically and morally correct. Other countries should take note.\u000a\u000aMichael Greenstone is the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics at MIT and the Director of The Hamilton Project.

a((VAn article in the CPM journal,People’s Democracy,focuses on the just-concluded climate change conference at Cancun. It says a closer look at what was actually decided at Cancun,and what was not said,reveals a very different picture. “It would show that in fact,all the disastrous formulations in the US-driven Copenhagen Accord have been carried through and formalised at Cancun,and will now inevitably form the basis for any new global climate agreement arrived at in Durban next year,” it says,noting that the clear continuity in content has prompted some radical critics to label the summit “Cancunhagen”.\u000a\u000a“The Kyoto Protocol,with its crucial distinction between developed and developing countries,was critically wounded in Copenhagen and has virtually been buried at Cancun. It is now almost certain that the Kyoto Protocol will be replaced by a single framework for all categories of nations.\u000a\u000a“Binding targets for developed countries decided on the basis of the science regarding sustainable limits for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations now appear set to be replaced by a pledge-and-review process with highly uncertain outcomes,” it notes.\u000a\u000aIt says it is telling that in the Cancun Agreements,the LCA document is of 30 pages,the one on forests,again mainly in developing countries,nine pages,and the Kyoto Protocol document is just two pages long. “Most of the meat of the Cancun Agreements is contained in the LCA text and it can safely be predicted that the LCA text will form the ‘single framework’ basis for any agreement that emerges at Durban,” it claims.\u000a\u000aRotting pillars\u000a\u000aThe CPI’s official voice,New Age,focuses on the “rot in the media” in the light of the Niira Radia tapes. It says the revelations in the tape show that the rot in the media is no less than the one that has affected the other pillars of the democracy. “Much is being talked about the political corruption and involvement of the corporate houses in promoting it,the most corrupt in the whole episode; the bureaucracy has not been touched. It is well known that the administration at all levels is stinking with corruption\u2026 Astonishing is the fact that the same corrupt bureaucracy has now started manipulating the Niira Radia leaks as well,” it says. In the light of the matter going to the courts,it argues that a plan is afoot to confuse the whole matter and shield the real culprits,although the editorial maintains that the leaks are definitely selective.\u000a\u000aPointing out that corruption by those politicians in power was a known fact,it says what is new is that corruption is spreading to all spheres of economic and social life. “The holy cows of judiciary and defence forces too have been badly affected.” While a two-member bench of the apex court has insisted that there is something rotten in the Allahabad high court,a sitting judge of the West Bengal high court is going to face impeachment proceedings and another judge of the Karnataka high court is facing similar charges. “More and more cases of corruption are tumbling out of the cupboard of the defence forces. In such a situation,it was expected that the media,supposedly the fourth pillar of the democracy and its watchdog will play its due role. Alas,it is not so. The journalists have turned out to be lobbyists,” it says.\u000a\u000aUS string-pullers\u000a\u000aThe CPI(ML) says that the most significant aspect of the WikiLeaks disclosures about India was the extent of US interference in India’s affairs,especially relating to the nuclear deal and foreign policy,though the media has lost sight of these crucial revelations as it is largely focusing on the off-the-cuff remarks made by Rahul Gandhi to the US ambassador.\u000a\u000aAs far as the controversy over Gandhi is concerned,the lead editorial in CPI(ML) weekly journal ML Update says that the Congress today lacks the courage to boldly uphold even the stand taken by Jawaharlal Nehru,who had categorically said that while majority and minority communalisms are both dangerous,majority communalism is more so as it can masquerade as nationalism and therefore grow into fascism.\u000a\u000aBut behind the red herring of Gandhi’s remarks,attention has been diverted from the most significant WikiLeaks revelations about India. “They show how not only the Congress and UPA government push pro-US policies,but even the BJP is persuaded by the US ambassador to calibrate their opposition to the nuke deal just enough,so as to ensure that the bill is passed,” it says.\u000a\u000a“They also reveal how both US and Indian officials are very aware that Indian people have no tolerance for US interference or for inequality in the US-India relation,and therefore collude to mask this interference and inequality. For instance,former Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon is heard cautioning the US ambassador against publicly instructing India on foreign relations,” it says.\u000a\u000aIt says that Menon told US officials that India has to be seen following an independent foreign policy and Home Minister P. Chidambaram conveyed to the FBI director that “we must be able to say we had access,even if Headley did not speak”. In other words,the editorial says,“we are being lied to by our government,about the extent to which ‘coordination’ and ‘dictation’ are taking place”.\u000a\u000aCompiled by Manoj C.G.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

Data from VCCedge show five PE/VC investments worth $377 million (Rs 1,715 crore), including a mega one of $290 mn by Blackstone in Moser Baer, the solar power company. As against this, 2009 saw six deals in the sector, worth $160 mn.\u000a\u000aExperts attribute the interest of angel investors in RE \u2014 wind, solar and hydel and biomass \u2014 to the government\u2019s recent initiatives. The latter plans to get 20 gigawatts (Gw, or 20,000 Mw) from sunlight by 2020. It launched the National Solar Mission last year as part of a strategy to cut the country\u2019s carbon footprint.\u000a\u000aEnticing figures\u000a\u000aIndia could attract $169 billion (Rs 7.7 lakh crore) for clean power projects over the next decade, according to a recent report of The Pew Charitable Trusts. Over the next decade, India is projected to increase its RE capacity to 91 Gw, five times what is currently installed, adds the report.\u000a\u000aAnother recent study, conducted by the Centre For Development of the Chennai-based Institute for Financial Management and Research, in alliance with World Resources Institute, says India has an aggregate market potential of $2.11 billion per year (Rs 9,600 crore) for clean energy. That comprises $2.04 bn for decentralised RE services and $70.1 mn for energy products such as solar lanterns and solar home systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe RE segment did not witness the same level of activity as the thermal power sector because of concerns over an unfavourable regulatory environment and scalability. Now, the government is slowly but surely ushering in changes that will make RE generation projects more attractive for investors. We expect PE interest in RE generation to sustain over the next few years.\u201d said Venkat Subramanyam, founder-director, Veda Corporate Advisors, an investment banking firm which has closed a couple of PE deals in renewable energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cIncentives offered by India for wind energy are attractive, but solar (energy) is not attractive for us at this point in time, due to lack of clarity on long-term return on investments,\u201d says Rajiv Mishra, managing director of CLP India, the largest foreign private power company operating in India. CLP is planning to add 300 Mw every year in the coming years to take its wind power capacity to about 2,000 Mw.\u000a\u000aFunds move in\u000a\u000aSeeing the potential, Indian PE players are also launching clean energy-focused funds. Recently, BTS Investment Advisors, a Mumbai-based PE firm focused on small and medium enterprises, said it was launching a $120 mn (Rs 545 crore) fund.\u000a\u000aEarly this week, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) increased its support for clean energy and announced an injection of up to $40 mn in two new India-focused PE funds. The money is to go equally to the Clean Resources Asia Growth Fund and the Renewable Energy Asia Fund. ADB is targeting $2 bn investments a year in clean energy by 2013 in Asia.\u000a\u000aLast month, the Asia-focused PE firm, Olympus Capital Holdings, increased its stake in Chennai-based Orient Green Power Company Ltd, the first Indian RE company to be listed. Olympus has a $250-mn regional environment fund. Earlier, the fund had invested $35 mn in Orient Green and $10 mn each in Bessemer Venture Partners and Shriram EPC.\u000a\u000aTwo months earlier, Auro Mira Energy Company Pvt Ltd, another Chennai-based RE company, raised $21 mn from a clutch of PE investors, comprising Aureos South Asia Fund, IFC and ePlanet Ventures. It has four new RE projects of 100 Mw capacity in hydro and biomass sectors. \u201cGiven the power deficit scenario and the government focus on RE, we as a fund are focused on RE investment opportunities,\u201d said Balaji Srinivas, managing partner, Aureos India.\u000a\u000aLast month, Greenko Group Plc, backed by PE firms, acquired Hemavathy Power for $33 mn. Early this year, TPG Growth, an arm of global private equity major TPG, invested $116 mn in Greenko, which is targeting 1,000 Mw capacity in five years. Its other investors include Global Environment Fund and Aloe Environment Fund.\u000a\u000aIDFC Private Equity had acquired the wind energy assets of BP Energy India for $95 mn (Rs 463 crore) last year. It has invested about $200 mn since 2007 to acquire assets in companies such as Moser Baer Photovoltaic, Green Infra, Emergent Ventures India and Suzlon\u2019s arm, SE Forge Ltd.\u000a\u000aFuture bet\u000a\u000aS G Shyam Sundar, managing director, IDFC PE, said, \u201cThere would be huge potential for clean energy in India in the backdrop of mounting prices of traditional fuel and the increasing energy demand.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdding: \u201cAbundant resources and the government\u2019s policy to support the clean energy sector to meet the increasing demand for power makes the sector interesting for investors.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince last year, the International Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, has invested $25 mn in Bhilwara Energy, $10 mn in Auro Mira Energy and also in Azure Power India, a solar power company.

a((VAHMEDABAD: Interlinking of Sabarmati and Narmada rivers is a perfect example of measures taken to combat climate change. This claim was made by the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, who believes that the move has improved public health and also helped Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation save Rs 18 crore in electricity bills. Modi was speaking at a function organised to release his book \u2018Convenient action, Gujarat response to challenges of climate change\u2019. The book was released by former president APJ Abdul Kalam and Nobel laureate RK Pachauri.Pachauri is also the executive chairman of The Energy and Resources Institute TERI ) and is on the panel of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. Pachauri said Gujarat is most vulnerable to climate change impact as the state has the largest coastline. He added that mangrove plantation is one step towards averting the disaster.He further said that he is a member of Clinton Foundation that recently decided to set up a 3,000 MW solar thermal power station in Gujarat. Pachauri pointed out that the solar cells will be manufactured by local entrepreneurs of Gujarat. Modi claimed that earlier city hospitals used to be flooded with patients suffering from vector-borne diseases. According to him, Narmada water has improved quality of drinking water and public health. He added that one does not need to know rocket science to overcome these challenges. \u201cIt just requires a strong political will and public participation,\u201d he added.

a((VThe agreement achieved at the climate summit in Cancun was a "big step" that exceeded expectations, a top UN official on climate change has said, asking nations to get to the task of quickly implementing the measures with credible accountability systems.\u000a\u000aAll nations, particularly the industrialised ones, must follow up the successful UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun with higher global emission cuts and the rapid launch of new institutions and green funds, Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) said.\u000a\u000a"Cancun was a big step, bigger than many imagined might be possible. But the time has come for all of us to exceed our own expectations because nothing less will do," said Figueres.\u000a\u000aThe Cancun Agreements, reached on December 11 in Mexico call for countries to list under the UNFCCC the emission reduction targets and actions which they announced in 2010, forming the collective basis for the largest mitigation effort the world has ever seen.\u000a\u000aThey also agreed to build a comprehensive system of mutual accountability towards these goals.\u000a\u000a"It needs to be implemented as fast as possible, and it needs to be accompanied by credible accountability systems that will help in measuring real progress," she said.\u000a\u000aFigueres said if all the Cancun targets and actions are fully implemented, UN estimates show they could deliver only 60% of the emission reductions that science says will be needed to stay below the agreed two degree rise in average temperatures.\u000a\u000aA two-degree rise does not guarantee the survival of the most vulnerable peoples.\u000a\u000aThe Cancun Agreements also include the most comprehensive package ever agreed by governments to help developing nations deal with climate change, including new institutions, funding channels and a technology transfer mechanism to help build its own sustainable, low-emissions future, adapt more effectively to climate change, and preserve and protect forests, the official said.\u000a\u000aFigueres said that she expected in particular to see rapid decisions on appointing the board of the new Green Fund and the Committee of the Technology Mechanism.\u000a\u000a"All countries, but particularly industrialised nations, need to deepen their emission reduction efforts and to do so quickly," she said.

"The holy cows of judiciary and defence forces too have been badly affected." While a two-member bench of the apex court has insisted that there is something rotten in the Allahabad high court, a sitting judge of the West Bengal high court is going to face impeachment proceedings and another judge of the Karnataka high court is facing similar charges. "More and more cases of corruption are tumbling out of the cupboard of the defence forces. In such a situation, it was expected that the media, supposedly the fourth pillar of the democracy and its watchdog will play its due role. Alas, it is not so. The journalists have turned out to be lobbyists," it says.\u000a\u000aUS string-pullers\u000a\u000aThe CPI(ML) says that the most significant aspect of the WikiLeaks disclosures about India was the extent of US interference in India's affairs, especially relating to the nuclear deal and foreign policy, though the media has lost sight of these crucial revelations as it is largely focusing on the off-the-cuff remarks made by Rahul Gandhi to the US ambassador.\u000a\u000aAs far as the controversy over Gandhi is concerned, the lead editorial in CPI(ML) weekly journal ML Update says that the Congress today lacks the courage to boldly uphold even the stand taken by Jawaharlal Nehru, who had categorically said that while majority and minority communalisms are both dangerous, majority communalism is more so as it can masquerade as nationalism and therefore grow into fascism.\u000a\u000aBut behind the red herring of Gandhi's remarks, attention has been diverted from the most significant WikiLeaks revelations about India. "They show how not only the Congress and UPA government push pro-US policies, but even the BJP is persuaded by the US ambassador to calibrate their opposition to the nuke deal just enough, so as to ensure that the bill is passed," it says.\u000a\u000a"They also reveal how both US and Indian officials are very aware that Indian people have no tolerance for US interference or for inequality in the US-India relation, and therefore collude to mask this interference and inequality. For instance, former Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon is heard cautioning the US ambassador against publicly instructing India on foreign relations," it says.\u000a\u000aIt says that Menon told US officials that India has to be seen following an independent foreign policy and Home Minister P. Chidambaram conveyed to the FBI director that "we must be able to say we had access, even if Headley did not speak". In other words, the editorial says, "we are being lied to by our government, about the extent to which 'coordination' and 'dictation' are taking place".\u000a\u000aCompiled by Manoj C.G.\u000a\u000aALSO READ The taper tigers\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VUpdated: Wed, Dec 22 2010. 11 27 PM IST\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh is not new to controversy. At present he is being targeted by the political opposition and some green activists for relaxing India\u2019s stand on climate change at the just concluded negotiations in Cancun, Mexico. Ramesh believes his actions have been misunderstood and that his stance, sometimes controversial, on domestic development projects is based on existing green laws. In an interview with Mint, Ramesh maintained that his tenure has marked a shift in the way the environment ministry views the development versus environment debate. Going forward, he is convinced that his actions will not be reversed. Edited excerpts:\u000a\u000aCritics say that you sold out at Cancun. True?\u000a\u000aThat is a complete misreading of the situation. I think what we accomplished at Cancun has been recognized internationally. Whether in developed or developing countries, India\u2019s role in fashioning a solution at Cancun and restoring the primacy of the multilateral process has been acknowledged. It is a bit unfortunate that there have been certain sections in India which have sort of cried foul and said sovereignty has been bartered away, for the umpteenth time.\u000a\u000aWhat is your justification of the change in stance?\u000a\u000aI have sent a detailed six-page letter to all members of Parliament where I have explained what all our contributions at Cancun were. I have explained the comment that all countries should take binding commitments in appropriate legal form. I think we should recognize the changing political landscape. Developing countries want a legally binding agreement. Within BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), Brazil and South Africa want a legally binding agreement. The Aosis (Alliance of Small Island States) countries, the LDCs (Least Developed Countries), which are natural partners and allies of India want a legally binding agreement and, therefore, we have to be sensitive to this issue and we have to expanded the negotiating room (for India).\u000a\u000aI think what we have actually accomplished at Cancun is to put India in the driver\u2019s seat; in a pivotal position to determine the future course of negotiations. We are not talking absolute emission cuts. I have said categorically that all we are doing is internationalizing a domestic voluntary target, which we have set for ourselves, which is the emissions intensity of GDP (gross domestic product) declining by 20-25% by 2020 on 2005 reference levels.\u000a\u000aWhy the criticism then?\u000a\u000aActually I think we have gained very substantially, but I recognize that every new idea in India, every new policy initiative in India goes through this \u2018Rama\u2019 cycle: First rejection, agitation, second, modification, third and finally, accommodation and acceptance, which was true of Manmohan Singh\u2019s 1991 reforms and certainly true of our evolving position on climate change. Let me say that I am not defensive. Our position has evolved. Our position has changed. And that is the essence of negotiations when you are confronted with geopolitical realities. Otherwise we keep chanting mantras\u2026 Negotiations are about repositioning India. From day one I have had three fundamental objectives in climate change. First, to protect India\u2019s economic growth of 9% per year. Second, to advance India\u2019s domestic environment agenda and third to reposition India, to change the narrative of India globally. To reposition India diplomatically from a defensive player to a player who is actually working to craft a solution. I think today it is universally acknowledged that we were responsible for crafting the Copenhagen Accord and certainly in the Cancun agreement as well. So, yes, the world is full of risks. How the world will evolve we don\u2019t know. But we have bought ourselves time and credibility. And now we should follow it up.\u000a\u000aSo, in this evolution of negotiating strategy, there is also a time for India to agree to mandatory emission cuts?\u000a\u000aYes, maybe by 2050. Maybe in the next 30 years. Maybe 20 years after China agrees to go in for mandatory cuts.\u000a\u000aYou are increasingly being referred to as a green warrior for your stance on some projects.\u000a\u000aWell, interesting that the one major Indian newspaper, which attacks me day in and day out for being a green warrior has gone out of its way to support my position on Cancun. It is amazing that they couldn\u2019t find anything good to say about me except on Cancun. So, environment does make strange bedfellows, whether domestic or international. But I am no environmentalist; not an activist, not an NGO (non-governmental organization). I come from the growth constituency. Long before liberalization and globalisation and privatization became acceptable in this country, I was part of a small minority advocating this aggressively. I can think of only three people: Montek (Singh) Ahluwalia is one of them and Rakesh Mohan is another. Long before people discovered the need for globalization, we were advocating this and I had a small role to play in the 1991 economic reforms. And the PM (Prime Minister) knows this because I work very closely with him. So, I don\u2019t need any certificates for my commitment to growth from anybody. But what I am doing here is plain and simple\u2014implementing the laws that Parliament has passed. Now you can ask me what was happening in the past? I don\u2019t want to get into the past. Environment was seen to be a formality in the past, an obstacle. It was seen to be something to be navigated around creatively and innovatively. That is no longer true.\u000a\u000aDo you have the PM\u2019s backing on your decisions?\u000a\u000aThe PM and the Congress president appointed me here 19 months ago and contrary to my epitaph being written in the media from time to time, I have survived. It couldn\u2019t have been without their support. They might have a different view or a nuance here or there but if they didn\u2019t have sympathy with what I do, I wouldn\u2019t be here. Parliament did not pass these laws in a fit of amnesia. if they want to amend, I am all for it. In fact, I am doing a complete root and branch amendment of the coastal regulation zone (CRZ), 1991, and very soon, in the next couple of days, we will come out with with CRZ notification 2010, which I am sure will make many environmentalists unhappy. I am sure I will be accused of pandering to the builder lobby in Mumbai and many fishermen organizations will ask me what I have done. But we need economic activity, we need these slums to be redeveloped, we need these old buildings to be redeveloped. We have created new windows for Mumbai and Goa and Kerala, Sunderbans, and Lakshadweep and Andaman. India\u2019s coastline is 7,500km long and you cannot have a cookie-cutter approach.\u000a\u000aWill this change end with Jairam or will it be an institutional change?\u000a\u000aLet me ask you when (T.N.) Seshan came to the Election Commission, people said \u2018oh it will only last during Seshan\u2019s tenure.\u2019 But the Election Commission today is no doormat. CVC (Central Vigilance Commission) is no doormat. People do make a difference. I believe whoever succeeds me will continue the work and see the merit in it. I am not doing this to take panga with A or B. If anything my actions have hurt Congress-ruled states as much as others. Individuals bring their own style into the picture, but I am sure it will outlast.\u000a\u000aYou are effecting a change in the mindset of the country in terms of environment.\u000a\u000aWe need to look at the debates of environment versus growth and conservation versus growth. We need to take them seriously. We need 9% growth, no doubt. In 1991, Manmohan Singh created the paradigm of growth. And for 20 years we talked of fiscal sustainability. Now we have to talk of ecological sustainability of this growth. We need the fiscal and ecological pillars. We can\u2019t deforest our way to 9% growth. Over time people will get used to the idea. In 1991, the PM (Manmohan Singh) said we can\u2019t spend our way to prosperity. And similarly now, we can\u2019t pollute our way to prosperity.\u000a\u000aWhat is the status of the long-pending fuel-efficiency norms?\u000a\u000aThey will be notified by BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) very soon. Initially, it will be voluntary labelling and will become mandatory, I am hoping by the middle of 2012.\u000a\u000aEarlier, the target was mid-2011, so it is delayed by a year. But I do believe India needs mandatory fuel-efficiency norms.\u000a\u000aanil.p@livemint.com

a((VPARIS: Counter-intuitive but true, say scientists: a string of freezing European winters scattered over the last decade has been driven in large part by global warming The culprit, according to a new study, is the Arctic\u2019s receding surface ice, which at current rates of decline could to disappear entirely during summer months by the century\u2019s end.The mechanism uncovered triples the chances that future winters in Europe and north Asia will be similarly inclement, the study reports.Bitingly cold weather wreaked havoc across Europe in the winter months of 2005-2006, dumping snow in southern Spain and plunging eastern Europe and Russia into an unusually \u2014 and deadly \u2014 deep freeze.Another sustained cold streak in 2009-2010 gave Britain its coldest winter in 14 years and wreaked transportation havoc across the continent. This year seems poised to deliver a repeat performance.At first glance, this flurry of frostiness would seem to be at odds with standard climate change scenarios in which Earth\u2019s temperature steadily rises, possibly by as much as five or 6°Celsius by 2100.Climate sceptics who question the gravity of global warming or that humans are to blame point to the deep chills as confirmation of their doubts.Such assertions, counter scientists, mistakenly conflate the long-term patterns of climate with the short-term vagaries of weather, and ignore regional variation in climate change impacts.New research, however, goes further, showing that global warming has actually contributed to Europe\u2019s winter blues.Rising temperatures in the Arctic \u2014 increasing at two to three times the global average \u2014 have peeled back the region\u2019s floating ice cover by 20% over the last three decades. This has allowed more of the Sun\u2019s radiative force to be absorbed by dark-blue sea rather than bounced back into space by reflective ice and snow, accelerating the warming process.More critically for weather patterns, it has also created a massive source of heat during the winter months.\u201cSay the ocean is at 0°C,\u201d said Stefan Rahmstorf , a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\u201cThat is a lot warmer than the overlying air in the polar area in winter, so you get a major heat flow heating up the atmosphere from below which you don\u2019t have when it is covered by ice. That\u2019s a massive change,\u201d he said.The result, according to a modelling study published earlier this month the Journal of Geophysical Research, is a strong high-pressure system over the newly-exposed sea which brings cold polar air, swirling counter-clockwise, into Europe.\u201cRecent severe winters like last year\u2019s or the one of 2005-2006 do not conflict with the global warming picture, but rather supplement it,\u201d explained Vladimir Petoukhov , lead author of the study and a physicist at the Potsdam Institute. \u201cThese anomalies could triple the probability of cold winter extremes in Europe and north Asia,\u201d he said.The researchers created a computer model simulating the impact on weather patterns of a gradual reduction of winter ice cover in the Barents-Kara Sea, north of Scandinavia. afp

a((VVARANASI: Now synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are coming up for improved disaster-monitoring, besides providing time for preventive measures to mitigate the damages from natural disasters, if they occur again in the particular area.Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Dharmendra Singh, associate professor, department of electronics and computer engineering, IIT-Roorkee , said that the SAR technology that uses satellite datasets for analysing images generated through RADAR SAT-1 on C-band has shown better map depiction. It clearly shows changes occurring between two image acquisitions of the same area with desired temporal space.Saying that the technology has already been used for identifying shrinkage and subsidence of New Orleans city in US after Katrina hurricane in 2005, he also emphasised that it promises better disaster monitoring in the country that has already suffered natural disasters in the form of Tsunami and earthquakes.It may be mentioned here that Singh was in the city on Wednesday to attend the three-day international conference on geophysical sciences, energy, climate change and evolution of human society (ICON GSECCES-2010), organised by the department of geophysics, BHU. Singh has worked on a project funded by Canadian Space Agency between 2005 and 2008.Saying that the SAR images had provided detailed account of horizontal and vertical displacement after devastating hurricane in US, Singh also emphasised that data analysis and findings showed that the city was witnessing shrinkage at astonishing rate of six millimetres per year.A number of factors including groundwater withdrawals and drainage of organic soil were taken into consideration and the studies showed interesting results in the form of subsidence of the city. The images could be used for detecting subsidence in coal fields of the country, he added.Meanwhile, the second day of the seminar witnessed presentations and discussions on a number of issues related to energy, meteorology and disaster management using climate modelling and mapping.

a((VVARANASI: While solar constant-- an important factor for determining weather change-- has long been interpreted as a constant factor, the new studies and researches have shown that the factor is not only a variable but is also governed by uneven distribution of Sun energy emanating from the Sun rays, which is leading to wrong predictions of monsoon and climate change."The solar constant is, in fact, a variable and no laws of science (physics) could predict accurate weather conditions and climate changes by considering it a constant factor," said senior scientist and head, Climatology and Hydrometeorology Division, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, NN Singh while talking to TOI on Thursday. Saying "accurate predictions of weather conditions and climate change are as difficult as anything," he also emphasised "even recent innovation like reanalysis of data from recorded instruments that are kept strategically over a place and satellite surveys have failed to yield error-free results."Singh, an alumnus of department of geophysics, Banaras Hindu University, was in the city on Thursday to attend the concluding session of the three-day international conference on geophysical sciences, energy, climate change and evolution of human society (ICON GSECCES-2010), also marking the diamond jubilee celebrations of the department (1949-2009)."A number of factors associated with weather forecasting keep changing over a particular area and so is the energy distribution of Sun rays," said Singh. He is also the founder head of the division run under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, New Delhi. Factors including air pressure, density and temperature not only decrease while going upwards, there is a difference even while going horizontally. The major difficulty arises while considering mean of the variations over a period of time to predict climate change and, more often than not, it is not error-free and there are lot of variations in these factors in different regions.However, Singh also said based on long calculations and mathematical models, the scientists had come close to predicting draught conditions in different parts of the country. The global warming may be a menace for the world but, for scientists, it gives interesting cues about draught conditions.The predictions based on the scientific model indicate that if the global mean temperature is around 15.6 degree Celsius, areas like Rajasthan, West Bengal, Bihar and parts of Jharkhand are likely to witness heavy rainfall while parts of central India and Indo-Gangetic plain could witness draught. However, situation could reverse if the global mean temperature is brought down to nearly 15.2 degree Celsius.Meanwhile, the three-day international conference also concluded on Thursday with presentations of natural disaster, climate change and energy.

At 423 meters below sea level, the Dead Sea is the lowest place on earth which attracts millions of tourists from around the world to enjoy its legendary healing properties.\u000a\u000a"The study aims to get a complete record in unprecedented resolution -- at one year intervals -- of the last five hundred thousand years," said Prof Ben-Avraham. Looking at the core sample to be dug about five miles offshore near Ein Gedi, the researchers hope to pinpoint particular years in Earth history to discover the planet's condition. They will be able to see what the climate was like 365,250 years ago, for instance, or determine the year of a catastrophic earthquake, a TAU release said, describing the 40 day project as the largest ever Earth sciences study of its kind in Israel.\u000a\u000aThe evidence, according to the university, will help the world's climatologists calibrate what they know about climate change from other geological samples and may lead to better predictions of what's in store for Middle East weather.\u000a\u000aFor example, it would reveal whether the present dry and hot periods in the region are something new or are they part of some larger cyclical pattern? What they find should also shed light on earthquake patterns; important information for Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians who live on or around the fault line that passes through the Dead Sea region, said the release.\u000a\u000a"The sediments provide an 'archive' of the environmental conditions that existed in the area in its geological past," Prof Ben-Avraham was quoted as saying.\u000a\u000aWhile the samples being collected are not as deep as oil explorers drill to look for oil, the core will be something special: it will be kept in an unbroken piece so that records can be traced more accurately, the researchers said. The study is being supported by the Israel Sciences Academy and includes dozens of scientists from America, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Japan and Israel.\u000a\u000aScientists from Jordan and the Palestinian Authority are also cooperating in this unique event. The researchers come from a variety of disciplines, from environmental science to chemistry and each will get different parts of the core to analyse.\u000a\u000a

The first machine of this type was installed on Mauna Loa in the 1950s at the behest of Charles David Keeling, a scientist from San Diego. His resulting discovery, of the increasing level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, transformed the scientific understanding of humanity's relationship with the earth. Yet, five years after his death, his discovery is a focus not of celebration but of conflict. It has become the touchstone of a worldwide political debate over global warming.\u000a\u000aWhen Keeling, as a young researcher, became the first person in the world to develop an accurate technique for measuring carbon dioxide in the air, the amount he discovered was 310 parts per million. That means every million pints of air, for example, contained 310 pints of carbon dioxide. By 2005, the year he died, the number had risen to 380 parts per million. In the next few years it is expected to pass 400.\u000a\u000aKeeling's half-century record of carbon dioxide measurements stands unchallenged even today. By the 1950s, when Keeling was completing his scientific training, scientists had been observing the increasing use of fossil fuels and wondering whether carbon dioxide in the air was rising as a result. But nobody had been able to take accurate measurements of the gas. Keeling built instruments and developed techniques that allowed him to achieve great precision in making such measurements.\u000a\u000aHe made profound discoveries. One was that carbon dioxide oscillated according to the seasons. Keeling realised the reason: most of the world's land is in the Northern Hemisphere, and plants there were taking up carbon dioxide as they sprouted leaves and grew over the summer, then shedding it as the leaves died in the winter. He had discovered that the earth itself was breathing. A more ominous finding was that each year, carbon dioxide was indeed rising, and quickly. Later chemical tests, by Keeling and others, proved that the increase was due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The graph showing rising carbon dioxide levels came to be known as the Keeling Curve. Still, by the time he died, global warming had not become a major political issue. That changed in 2006, when Gore's movie and book, both titled An Inconvenient Truth, brought the issue to wider public attention.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Outsiders in Kutch's mini-Punjab: Sikh farmers battling for their land\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VUpdated: Sun, Dec 26 2010. 10 23 PM IST\u000a\u000aIn what could revive controversy over the state of glaciers in the Himalayas, researchers associated with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and the government-run Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology suggest that aerosols such as soot\u2014tiny particles that are often the result of insufficiently burnt gases\u2014may be playing a key role in affecting glacier health.\u000a\u000aAlthough previous studies, too, have suggested such a link, they relied entirely on satellite imagery. The latest study, part of a department of science and technology-funded project, is based on actual physical measurements of glaciers and, according to experts, considered an accurate picture of the contraction and expansion of glaciers.\u000a\u000aThe finding suggests that the link between contracting glaciers and climate change is far more complex than has been assumed, although the experts who conducted the study emphasize that the finding is \u201cpreliminary and more observations are required\u201d to confirm it.\u000a\u000aChanging conditions: The Dokriani glacier in the Himalayas. It may mean that neither the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which views greenhouse gases (GHGs) as being chiefly responsible for global warming that accelerates the melting of glaciers, nor the Indian government, which holds that the phenomenon in the Himalayas cannot be definitely linked to man-made causes, are entirely correct in their assessments.\u000a\u000aIn the latest issue of the peer-reviewed journal Current Science, the researchers say that varying aerosol concentrations in and around the Himalayan region were significantly associated with the expansion and concentration of the Dokriani glacier.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve observed this in the Dokriani, which is among the best studied and measured Himalayan glaciers and, therefore, the trend is far more reliable. However, it does seem that aerosols have an important role,\u201d said Sanat Kumar Das of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, an Isro organisation, and among the key authors of the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt could also be that aerosols and GHGs are combining to trigger glacial melt. Also, we need more data to study such effects on bigger glaciers such as the Gangotri glacier,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAlthough GHGs and aerosols both affect the climate, their mode of action differs. GHGs almost universally heat up the atmosphere and accelerate global warming, whereas aerosols\u2014also a product of vehicle exhaust and stray dust particles\u2014sometimes heat up and sometime cool the atmosphere. All international negotiations and existing treaties focus on GHGs, and aerosols\u2014being less understood\u2014have been out of their ambit.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC reported in 2007 that global warming was rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers and at the current rate these would disappear by 2035, a conclusion that triggered a public war of words between IPCC chief R.K. Pachauri and India\u2019s environment minister Jairam Ramesh.\u000a\u000aIn November 2009, the environment ministry publicized a report by a former deputy director general of the Geological Survey of India, V.K. Raina, that disputed IPCC\u2019s report.\u000a\u000aRaina\u2019s report said: \u201cIt would be premature to state that these glaciers were retreating abnormally because of global warming...\u201d\u000a\u000aIn January, IPCC\u2019s glacier claim was found to be faulty and based not on science but on a typo, and also used out of context, as reported by Mint on 20 January. IPCC subsequently retracted its claim on glaciers.

a((VThe clandestine endgame being played out at the at has concluded in a deal. The commentators and climate activists in the western world are ecstatic. Even the critics say pragmatism has worked and the world has taken a small step ahead in its battle to fight emissions that determine its growth.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s assess the outcome at to see if this is indeed a step forward. The challenge of climate change is formidable, we know. This is why at the Bali climate conference held in 2007 the target on the table was for the industrialised countries to cut 20-40 per cent by 2020, over their 1990 levels. The actual number was to be finalised at subsequent meetings. So, what does do? It mouths some platitudes that the industrialised countries will scale up their mitigation efforts. But it does not specify a target. It literally lets these countries off the hook.\u000a\u000aInstead, it endorses an arrangement that emission reduction commitments of industrialised countries will be decided on the voluntary pledge they make. They will tell us how much they can cut and by when. The US, which has been instrumental in getting the deal at Cancun, is the biggest winner. If its target to reduce emissions were based on its historical and current contribution to the problem, the country would have to cut 40 per cent by 2020 over 1990 levels. Now it has pledged that it will cut zero percentage points in this same period. The Cancun deal legitimises its right to pollute.\u000a\u000aBut this is not the end. Under the Cancun deal, all countries, including India and China, are now committed to reduce emissions. Our pledge to reduce energy intensity by 20-25 per cent by 2020 is part of this global deal. There can be no disagreements about this. After all, all countries must be part of the solution. It is also in our best interest to avoid pollution for growth.\u000a\u000aBut surely nobody can agree that the burden of the transition should shift to the developing world. But this is what has been dealt at Cancun. If you compare the sum of the \u201cpledges\u201d made by the industrialised countries against the \u201cpledges\u201d made by developing countries, including China and India, a curious fact emerges.\u000a\u000aWhile the total amount that the rich will cut amounts to some 0.8-1.8 billion tonnes of CO2e, the poor developing countries have agreed to cut 2.3 billion tonnes of CO2e by 2020.\u000a\u000aIn other words, emission reduction promised by the industrialised world is pathetic. And the principle of equity in burden-sharing has been completely done away with.\u000a\u000aAnd let us be clear: Cancun makes no pretence that global equity is a principle that is best thrashed in the world\u2019s dustbins. Just consider. All previous drafts of this agreement stated that developing countries would have equitable access to the global carbon budget. But this has been crucially diluted in the Cancun agreement. Now it reads in a fuzzy and meaningless way that there will be \u201cequitable access to sustainable development\u201d. In other words, we have bartered away the need to apportion the global atmospheric space based on our right to development.\u000a\u000aBut even this is not the worst. Let us for a moment say that we in India should be willing to pay this price for the global common good. But then the deal should be effective in its target to cut emissions. Instead, the pledges will add up to practically nothing in terms of averting the worst of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe calculation is that with the Cancun deal in force, the world is on a 3-4º C temperature increase. We know that we are most vulnerable to climate change. We know that already when world average temperatures have increased by just 0.8º C, our monsoons are showing signs of extreme variability \u2014 more rain in less rainy days \u2014 leading to floods and droughts. Then how can a weak and ineffective deal on climate change be good for us?\u000a\u000aBut the spin doctors want us to believe differently. This is understandable. Cancun is a deal, which protects the interests of the rich polluters. It is their prize.\u000a\u000aBut the question is what has the poor developing world got in return? There is no commitment to cut emissions, needed to avert climate change. No money is promised as well. The agreement provides for the creation of a green fund and repeats the decision to give $30 billion as fast-track funding by 2012 and $100 billion by 2020. But this is fictional money to cajole and bribe. The fact is that the rich world is saying openly that it cannot pay because of its recession. It now wants the developing world to look for these funds in the private sector. Nothing real is on the table.\u000a\u000aThe technology deal is even weaker. It only says that it will set up a technology centre. The tricky issue of preferential access to IPR over low-carbon technologies, which was being demanded by the developing world, has been skipped altogether.\u000a\u000aThe fact is that we hate being hated in the rich man\u2019s world. Cancun is about our need to be deal-makers on their behalf \u2014 even if it costs us the earth.

a((VWhen Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations (UNFCCC), exhorted the jaguar-eyed goddess of the moon, Ixchel, at the start of the summit in Cancun, most delegates would have silently agreed to any extra help after the disaster at the Copenhagen summit last year. Ixchel, also the goddess of reason, creativity and weaving, was indeed able to inspire those in to weave together elements that were required for a solid response to climate change using reason and creativity. clearly set the climate agenda back in the right direction, setting the path for the next year\u2019s summit in Durban.\u000a\u000aAt the end, was significantly able to address key issues in three critical areas, namely, (1) to resolve the importance of a mechanism to hold developed nations accountable for the financial pledges that have been made; (2) to hammer out the details on how these financial commitments made by developed nations can be delivered to developing nations in a framework palatable to all parties involved; and (3) to ensure that a framework exists to measure, verify and report the results achieved by the parties involved.\u000a\u000aFast Start Climate Finance\u000a\u000aThe financial support that has been pledged in the form of short-term finance for the immediate future, termed the Fast Start Climate Finance, has the guarantee of being a new and additional fund compared to existing development aid being recycled as climate change pledges. This was a major achievement at Cancun. The developing countries\u2019 misgivings about the were clearly evident from the statement made by India\u2019s Environment Minister midway through the summit. He said the scheme wasn\u2019t fast, hadn\u2019t yet started and there was no finance in it yet.\u000a\u000aIndia and the other (Brazil, South Africa and China) have rightly decided to forego any funding that comes from the pledges since smaller countries are in dire need of it. India has always took the position that the must not be viewed as a loan but a grant or an entitlement to compensate for the damage that has been done by developed countries so far. In fact, India\u2019s per capita emissions are a measly 1.31 tonnes and this figure is approximately 20 times less than that of Australia and the United States and at least four times less than that of China.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTotal and per capita CO 2 emissions Country CO2 emissions (in million\u000a\u000ametric tonnes) Per capita emissions\u000a\u000a(in tonnes) China 6,534 4.91 United States 5,833 19.18 Russia 1,729 12.29 India 1,495 1.31 Japan 1,214 9.54 Australia 437 20.82 Source: Union of Concerned Scientists\u000a\u000aHowever, as a responsible nation, India\u2019s role as a deal-maker rather than a deal-breaker has ensured that it took the onus of non-binding CO2 emissions on itself. India\u2019s nuanced stance of asking developed nations to kickstart climate financing and, at the same time, agreeing to set up a measurable, reportable and verifiable framework is a mature stance that makes it a constructive partner in the dialogue.\u000a\u000aLong-term funding\u000a\u000aUN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon had set up a High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (AGF), which included Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, to help devise ways in which funds could be raised to meet the $100 billion target every year by 2020. The report, which was tabled a few weeks before the Cancun summit began, outlined a number of public and private options to raise money.\u000a\u000aThe AGF report acknowledged that there were different perspectives within the Advisory Group on whether and how to measure revenues in terms of gross and net metrics, particularly regarding private and non-concessional flows, and there was no consensus in this matter. The Green Climate Fund, which has now been formalised in Cancun, will hold a portion of this long-term funding. The fact that this fund can be directly accessed by national institutions without being channelled through multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the World Bank, is another clear win since national institutions are far more suited to handle funding because they understand the contours of the country better. Moreover, like MDBs, they can raise additional money from capital markets with the funds that are disbursed to them.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s commitment\u000a\u000aThe National Action Plan on Climate Change is a comprehensive blueprint split into eight ambitious missions to tackle the climate change issue in India. Each of these missions ensures that our reliance on fossil fuels is reduced in the long run; afforestation programmes are implemented to create carbon sinks; sustainable urban solutions are provided in the realm of energy, waste management and modal transport; a holistic water-management solution is implemented; agriculture practices that are deployed are sustainable; a knowledge centre exists for tackling climate change; and special focus is given to preserve the Himalayan ecosystem.\u000a\u000aAddressing the climate change issue requires a multi-disciplinary approach and involves myriad ministries like the ministries of environment and forests, water resources, urban development, agriculture, science and technology and renewable energy. As Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, in a letter to the prime minister, pointed out that about 70 to 80 per cent of mitigation and adaptation work on climate change was being done at the state level, so a mechanism needs to be put in place to involve chief ministers. With such a wide range of stakeholders involved, the government would do better to have a single climate change nodal agency that could lay down guidelines, roadmaps and approaches in a consultative manner, which are then submitted to the respective ministries for implementation.\u000a\u000aGetting it done in Durban\u000a\u000aFor each of the national missions to deliver on its promise, it is imperative that they are provided with the necessary finance from the Long Term Fund and technological know-how to leverage the latest innovations. It is, therefore, very important for developing countries to have access to intellectual property-protected technologies and associated know-how on non-exclusive royalty-free terms. This would be one of the primary goals in Durban The other area of focus in Durban would be to follow up on the Advisory group\u2019s recommendation of the composition of the source of the long-term funds. The recommendation that a part of the total target of $100 billion be sourced from private and non-concessional flows needs further discussion, since this departs from the premise that the funds are provided as grants and entitlements and not as loans.\u000a\u000aLastly, with the first phase of commitments under the Kyoto Protocol ending in 2012, a second phase of commitments that holds developed countries accountable for their CO2 reduction targets is required. Durban would be the time to get all this done, irrespective of whether the Zulu goddess of nature, rain, fertility and agriculture, Nomkhumbulwane, is called upon by the Presidency. Bridging the trust deficit, a renewed political will to realise the magnitude of the issue and the ability to compromise all bode well when the summit goes to the rainbow nation next year.\u000a\u000aThe author is the Non-Executive Chairman of Greenko Group, Hyderabad. He also served as the Chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Andhra Pradesh, for 2009-2010

a((VUpdated: Mon, Dec 27 2010. 09 48 PM IST\u000a\u000aThe United Nations climate change conference in Cancun in early December was met with negativity and apathy. As I took part in the meetings, it was clear that after the failure of the Copenhagen talks late last year, there would be no agreement on reducing emissions and tackling climate change. But there is too much at stake for us to give up and go home. It is now up to the business community to take the lead\u2014and with a little help from government, we can succeed.\u000a\u000aI believe in this cause very strongly, and I also think that unless we start to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, we will face a worldwide crisis caused by the problems of climate change.\u000a\u000aAlso Read Richard Branson\u2019s earlier columns\u000a\u000aIt will impact the supply of food and water, and could prompt an economic slump that has the potential to be much more painful than the current recession.\u000a\u000aSo last year, I helped to launch the Carbon War Room, a business-focused, global NGO (non-governmental organization). Our goal is to encourage entrepreneurs and businesses to enter the battle against climate change: We aim to achieve it by unlocking capital to deliver scalable solutions that will make commercial sense.\u000a\u000aOne sector that desperately needs disruption and change is the shipping industry, which is a huge emitter of greenhouse gases. If the global shipping fleet were a country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after Germany.\u000a\u000aThe Carbon War Room has classified the efficiencies of every type of ocean vessel and initiated a system of eco-labelling clean and dirty ships that we hope will transform the industry\u2014the first step in making gigaton-scale reductions in emissions. A universal index sticker for every ship will offer a simple A to G rating, similar to the energy ratings commonly seen on refrigerators, washer and dryers, and televisions.\u000a\u000aThis will allow customers to pick the best ships in each fleet, and help the most progressive owners to display how efficient and cost-effective their ships are in comparison to the competition. As the companies that depend on shipping firms begin to rely on these labels, we can expect that they will make better decisions for their businesses and the environment.\u000a\u000aThis should remove the barriers that prevent capital from flowing to cleaner shipping technologies. The eco-labelling, we hope, will act as a catalyst for the shipping industry to become not only sustainable, but also more profitable over time, as efficiencies come into play.\u000a\u000aIt would be helpful if governments avoided taxing new forms of sustainable energy and technology, encouraged investment, and, as people switch away from non-renewable sources of energy, slowly started raising taxes on the old energy grid and industries that rely on it.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s all we truly need governments to do, then individual companies can do the rest, because the business community has always pushed progress forward more quickly and efficiently than governments can.\u000a\u000aBut entrepreneurs can\u2019t rely on governments everywhere to adopt such policies, and many are forging ahead alone. Consider the airline industry, which currently represents 2% of global CO2 emissions\u2014a number that is projected to grow quickly. Companies in this field are developing and trialling everything from sustainable biofuels for aviation to more efficient air-traffic control systems.\u000a\u000aAt Cancun, the Carbon War Room also celebrated the first annual Gigaton Awards, recognizing companies showing leadership in emissions reduction and sustainable practices.\u000a\u000aThe six winners of the prize had strong sustainability initiatives that included comprehensive accounting of emissions.\u000a\u000aWe celebrated Nike for its energy savings programme, which includes its Environmental Apparel Design Tool that designers use to make real-time choices that decrease the environmental impact of their work.\u000a\u000aIn the energy category, we recognized Suzlon for its achievement in managing its emissions and reaching sustainability milestones. Other winners included Reckitt Benckiser Group, 3M, Vodafone Group and GDF SUEZ. It is our hope that by singling out the pioneers who have changed the way they do business, we will encourage other companies to act.\u000a\u000aExperts predict that the world will have to invest more than $550 billion annually to make the next generation of industry a low-carbon reality\u2014clearly, a shift that must be led by businesses and the investment community.\u000a\u000aThis is not a choice between sacrifice and prosperity, or containment and development. Business is a force for change, and these are changes where we can show the world the way.\u000a\u000aBY NYT SYNDICATE\u000a\u000a©2010/RICHARD BRANSON\u000a\u000aRichard Branson is the founder of the Virgin Group and companies such as Virgin Atlantic, Virgin America, Virgin Mobile and Virgin Active.

a((VIt\u2019s never too late to make amends, says Maulana Wahiduddin, close on the heels of the recently concluded UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at Cancun , Mexico\u000a\u000aNatural balance\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s never too late\u000a\u000aStarry, Starry Nights\u000a\u000aNews of ecological disruptions pours in from all over the world almost every day. Sometimes, we hear that glaciers and polar ice caps are melting or that the oceans and seas are turning into cesspools. Several studies show that air, water and land have all become polluted. A Quranic verse from the chapter entitled Al-Rum (The Romans), says: \u201cCorruption appeared on land and sea due to manmade evils.\u201d (30:41). When the Quran predicted this, it also gave us the solution. It says: \u201cDo not corrupt the Earth after it has been set in order\u201d (7:56). The verse refers to the Creation Plan of God, but we appear to be trying to live our lives counter to this Plan and it is no longer sustainable.According to the Quran, God created Adam as the first man and settled him in Paradise where he was well provided for. He could enjoy it all - except a forbidden tree, which he was asked not to touch. The first man succumbed to temptation and ate the fruit of the forbidden tree. This led to his being ousted from Paradise; he was sent to earth. That tree symbolised greed. God had said all of man\u2019s needs would be catered to. However, that did not include providing for man\u2019s greed. This was the first lesson given to man.God now settled man on earth and there too, provided all that was required. There is everything on earth \u2014 air, water, and food, beautiful environs, everything. In pre-industrial times, lifestyles were simple. Once the industrial revolution happened and we began to produce things on a large scale, verything changed. Competition and the desire for profits as well as a yearning for more and more cquisitions led to senseless exploitation of natural resources. The balance was disturbed. Luxurious ifestyles became the aspiration of most, even if they were unsustainable. According to a Hadith, the Prophet of Islam once said: \u201cDon\u2019t live in luxury...because a luxurious life is not the life of true believers.\u201dA life of luxury is not sustainable as the world was not created for this purpose. Sustainable living would entail keeping consumption in line with one\u2019s needs, and not greed. Hence M K Gandhi famously said: \u201cSimple living and high thinking.\u201dI use the word \u2018greed\u2019 in an extended sense. There are several kinds of greed \u2014 for money, power and for material goods. Some people want more and more political power; they resort to muscle power to realise their ambition. God created everything in the right proportion. Carbon emissions are nothing new; it\u2019s just that prompted by greed, we tend to overdo it. Earlier whatever CO2 was emitted was absorbed by the trees and the oceans. With industrialisation and extensive manufacturing of goods, CO2 emissions have risen so high that the existing trees and oceans are reaching saturation levels and are unable to absorb the excess.We cannot create a new world to cater to our greed, so we must either change our lifestyle or face the consequences. Prophet Muhammad said: \u201cNever pollute air and never pollute water.\u201d When God created the world, all was in equilibrium, but the whole equation has now turned upside down.Now it\u2019s time to think deeply and begin changing the way we look at Creation and how we have treated it. Patchwork solutions will fail to address the problems at hand.I have adopted a lifestyle that is very simple. I am not saying everyone should adopt such a lifestyle, but at least one can try. For example, we can use a small car instead of a big one or if one must have a large car, car pools could be one way of contributing to reduction of pollution. It is not enough for people to realise the problem; we must take the necessary action to help alleviate the problem.In addition to statistics and studies, we get to read alarmist reports on the environment. One such is a media report quoting a scientist who says we have just 12 years to live. I don\u2019t know how accurate the scientist\u2019s calculation is, but clearly, time is ticking away. There may be a few more centuries to go, but things are changing so rapidly every day that we cannot afford to lose more time.I read in an article recently that 95 per cent of the water in our oceans is polluted. How can we survive in such a situation? Soon the day will come when we shall be quoting lines from The AncientMariner: \u201cWater, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.\u201dIn my childhood, I remember, the skies were very clear and the stars shone bright; the night sky was completely star-studded. Today, that is not the case \u2014 the atmosphere is so heavy with pollution that barely a few stars are visible. To bring back those starry nights, we need to reduce pollution. Moreover, adopting a simpler lifestyle would bring several other benefits that improve quality of life, reduce stress and bring contentment. Small, individual changes can indeed bring big results.

a((VJapan on Tuesday postponed the creation of a greenhouse gas emission trading system by a year until after April 2014 in the face of strong resistance from the business lobby, news reports said.\u000a\u000aThe centre-left government of Prime Minister Naoto Kan had planned to launch the system -- in which companies would essentially buy and sell 'licences to pollute' -- in the fiscal year starting in April 2013.\u000a\u000aBut his environment and other ministers decided to postpone the plan, saying the country will first "carefully consider it," Jiji Press and Kyodo News reported. Immediate confirmation was not available.\u000a\u000aA carbon-trading system sets a cap on the pollutants companies can emit and then forces heavy polluters to buy credits from companies that pollute less -- creating financial incentives to cut emissions.\u000a\u000aJapan has long championed the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, named after its ancient capital.\u000a\u000aBut Japan opposed its proposed extension at a UN meeting in Mexico this month, calling it unfair because it does not include 70 percent of the world's emissions, with top polluters China and the United States absent.\u000a\u000aChina, the world's largest emitter, has no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol as it is considered a developing country. The United States, alone among rich nations, has rejected the treaty.\u000a\u000aMost scientists say the world is far off track on meeting a goal, codified at the UN climate talks in Mexico, of keeping temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

Photo: Ritu Raj Konwar | Photo Credit: Ritu Raj Konwar+SEP+Ritu Raj Konwar - Ritu Raj Konwar\u000a\u000aClimate change is affecting the cultivation of Assam tea, with rising temperatures reducing yields and altering the distinctive flavour of India's most popular drink, researchers say.\u000a\u000aHigh hills and abundant rainfall make the north-eastern state of Assam an ideal place to grow tea, with 850 gardens over 3,20,000 hectares (5,93,000 acres) producing the majority of the country's harvest. But in the last 60 years, rainfall has fallen by more than a fifth and minimum temperature has risen by a degree to 19.5°C.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is clearly climate change, and it is bound to have major impact on the tea industry,\u201d said Debakanta Handique, a climate scientist in Assam.\u000a\u000aThe Tea Board of India said it had recorded a steady decline in tea production in recent years. In 2007, Assam produced 5,12,000 tonnes of tea. By 2008 this had declined to 4,87,000 tonnes, with estimated production in 2009 down again to 4,45,000 tonnes. A further decrease is expected this year.\u000a\u000a\u2018Serious threat'\u000a\u000aMridul Hazarika, director of Tocklai Tea Research, the oldest tea research station in the world, said rainfall and minimum temperature were two of the most important factors affecting both quality and quantity of harvests.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe decline has been taking place although there has been an increase in the area of tea cultivation as new gardens have come up, and many gardens have added new areas for tea plantation. This is an indication of the seriousness of the threat,\u201d said Hazarika. Efficient rainwater harvesting and new breeds of tea plants were needed to reverse the trend.\u000a\u000a\u201cChanges have already been observed in the flavour, but it is not possible to blame only climate change for this,\u201d he said. \u201cOther factors like the fertilisers used and cultivation methods might also be partly responsible.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe changing taste of Assam tea is a serious concern for growers. Sudipta Nayan Goswami, an Assam-based planter, said subtle changes had already been observed: \u201cThe flavour has changed from what it was before. The creamy and strong flavour is no more. There is a huge demand for Assam tea abroad, and this is due to its strong, bright flavour. The changes will sharply hamper the demand for this variety of tea abroad.\u201d\u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

a((VJairam Ramesh Calcutta, Dec. 28: Three proposed hydroelectric projects in Sikkim that the state government hopes will bring it revenues are being opposed by an organisation of Bhutias and Lepchas on religious and environmental grounds. “If the proposals are cleared, we will oppose them with all our might,” said an activist of the Sikkim Bhutia Lepcha Apex Committee, which is spearheading the protests. The committee has twice written to the Union environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, asking him to scrap the projects planned on the Rathong Cho river, which local populations in western Sikkim consider holy. “The Khangchen Dzonga Yuksun area (where the projects are planned) is a bio-eco hotspot and home to some of the rarest and vulnerable flora and fauna in the Himalayas,” said one of the letters. As of now, the National Board of Wildlife has withheld environmental clearance to one of the projects, the 96MW Lethang hydel scheme. But the Sikkim government hopes to get it cleared eventually. Requests for clearance to the other two — the 99MW Ting Ting project and the 97MW Tashiding project — are lying with Jairam’s ministry. “We want the remaining two projects scrapped too,” said Tseten Tashi Bhutia, convener of the committee. “The projects are not acceptable from religious, socio-cultural and environmental standpoints. They can even wipe out the sacred land of the Bhutias and Lepchas, the indigenous tribal people of Sikkim.” The state government, however, strongly backs the projects, to be constructed by private companies. The Sikkim power development corporation has procured the land. State power minister S.G. Lepcha said: “These protests are the handiwork of a (particular) group of people. The projects were planned following a demand from local people. There was no protest during the public hearings on the projects.” Lepcha, though, admitted that the projects were not just meant to supply power locally but to generate revenues by exporting power outside Sikkim. “Sikkim has a huge potential in hydro power. We are trying to tap a part of that,” he said. Members of the Sikkim Bhutia Lepcha Apex Committee alleged that the public hearings had been “manipulated”. “Instead of the state pollution control board, it was the private companies that organised and controlled the programmes. Even the government officials came to the hearings in cars arranged by them (the companies). There was large-scale arrangement of food and entertainment,” said one activist. In 1997, the Sikkim government had itself scrapped a hydel project in virtually the same area after a committee withheld recommendation to it. “The Sikkim Himalayas are richly endowed with biological resources . Orchids are abundant; (there is a) rich wildlife represented by the Himalayan black bear, musk deer, fishing cat, leopard cat, black-capped langur and a rich bird life.... This unique landscape unit should be protected,” the one-man committee of P.S. Ramakrishna, from the JNU School of Environmental Sciences, had said. Dipak Chakrabarty, an environment scientist with a government institution in Bengal, said “extreme care” should be taken before such projects are undertaken in the Himalayas, because of the dangers of huge deforestation, loss of biodiversity and landslides.

Green buildings are not technology the way we usually understand it. There are many technologies devised over the past 500 years that have stood the test of time and brought a combination of user-comfort and resource-efficiency. Cities such as Hampi, in their 16th century heyday, had over half a million residents, but secured water in a sustainable way without borewells or electricity.\u000a\u000aThey made ice, homes that beat heat and cold, fountains without pumps, and multi-storey structures without steel or cement. Buildings that survived the quakes in Bhuj, Uttarkashi and Latur were built before the 1920s.\u000a\u000aOf course, many modern innovations are promising too. A logical big step in green technology will be wireless transmission of power, eliminating the need for electrical cables. The other revolution we will see is a shift from AC to DC transmission. Both these bring one major advantage to the table: they cut transmission and distribution losses\u2014 the dissipation of electricity as heat due to the resistance of conductors.\u000a\u000aIndia gets to use only 60% of all power generated because of transmission and distribution losses. DC transmission, on the other hand, loses only about 3% of electricity over every 1,000km and offers better stability and control. India already has some successful instances of high-voltage direct transmission. The 1,000MW Rihand-Dadri line was commissioned in Uttar Pradesh and the 2,000MW Talcher-Kolar link, the biggest so far, spans four states: Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\u000a\u000aTechnology must extend primarily to four areas: energy, water, waste management and transportation. Cities such as Curitiba (Brazil), Barcelona (Spain), Phnom Penh (Cambodia) and Seoul (South Korea) show how the future will contour itself on efficient and smart administration of infrastructure. Paris and New York City (NYC) have shown how a city can be carbon-friendly. NYC\u2019s carbon footprint is 80% lesser than the average for the rest of the US.\u000a\u000aWe need a war against waste of energy and water. This would need laws banning deep borewells and high-energy lighting. Reuse of wastewater, aerators and flow restrictors should be encouraged and high tariffs imposed to deter callous practices.\u000a\u000aA shift in construction patterns will also be seen as we attempt to go greener. Prefabrication and assembly architecture will promote scale and affordability. Building materials will be derived from renewable resources. New technologies for air management will avoid using ozone-depleting substances for air conditioning and refrigeration. Cities such as Phnom Penh and Seoul are already working on a green skin for use in urban agriculture to reduce dependence on ecosystem lands.\u000a\u000aChandrashekar Hariharan is CEO of Biodiversity Conservation India (Pvt.)

a((VA major energy transformation is around the corner. A shortage of hydrocarbons in light of the rapidly growing economies of developing countries, their continuing profligate use in developed countries and the growing threat of climate change ordain it.\u000a\u000aBy 2030, India will need three to four times as much energy as we currently use, if our economy is to grow at 8% to 9% a year. We face huge challenges here. We import nearly 80% of our oil consumption - which was 133 metric tonnes (Mt) in 2008-09 and is expected to be around 142 Mt in 2010-11. By 2030, we may need from 350 Mt to 500 Mt of oil a year, depending on our growth rate and the policies we follow. Our domestic production of crude is expected to be around 35 Mt and we will need to import the rest. Will we be able to access the oil we need?\u000a\u000aWhile we have the resources to produce the coal we require, our ability to produce it as needed has been constrained by a number of hurdles. Environmental and other clearances form one such block - I am told Coal India needs 26 clearances before it can open a mine. The public sector monopoly and procedures that tie it up are another hurdle. Concern over climate change is a third.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, though total coal production in 2011-12 is expected to be around 570 Mt, from a long-term point of view, we are short of coal. Our known extractable reserves will not last beyond 2050 if our coal consumption continues to grow as it has been growing over the past 25 years. Meanwhile, the recently prescribed 'no-go' areas for coal mining, as laid down by the environment ministry, have also reduced extractable coal reserves and we may now run out of coal earlier than expected.\u000a\u000aThus, we face two main challenges: Where do we get our oil, and what to do when our coal runs out?\u000a\u000aWorld oil production is currently at about 4,000 Mt and is expected to reach 5,200 Mt by 2030. Of course, depending on the price of crude oil, production could vary between 4,700 Mt to 6,000 Mt. India's import of 300 Mt to 450 Mt will constitute 6% to 9% of global production, up from less than 3% today. We could try to access oil by acquiring oil assets abroad. While this would help us face the market risk of high oil prices, it would not necessarily increase our access to oil. In times of global shortage, the government of our host country could forbid the export of its oil. Instances of such resource nationalism are already being seen.\u000a\u000aWe can diversify the risk of such nationalism by acquiring assets in many different countries - and by having strong trade relations with these countries, so that we could pose the counter threat of halting vital exports to these countries if they threatened to stop the export of oil. In other situations, how worthwhile it is to acquire assets abroad depends on the price we have to pay, the probability of finding oil and the projected price of crude oil in the future. It is largely a commercial decision. If other investments promise higher returns, then the foreign exchange earned could provide the same insurance against high oil prices as oil assets abroad would have done.\u000a\u000aSo how high can oil prices go? In the very short term, they could go quite high if countries fail to mobilise alternatives and restrict demand. However, in the long run, price rise will be restrained by the availability of alternatives. Among these are shale gas or tar oil and renewables such as ethanol and biodiesel. Sugarcane- and corn-based ethanol require land and water and are therefore not a serious option for us, since this would compete with food production. Cellulosic ethanol made from agricultural waste and byproducts could be a very large and very important source that would not compete with food production. We could produce 200 Mt to 300 Mt of cellulosic ethanol a year. The only catch is that the technology is not yet economically viable. Many countries are working on it and Denmark is even in the process of setting up a commercial plant. I therefore expect a major breakthrough in this technology over the next few years. Once that happens, oil prices will level out.\u000a\u000aShale gas production is increasing rapidly too, and this is one reason gas prices today are almost delinked from crude prices. Shale gas production will help moderate oil prices on the international market.\u000a\u000aNatural gas could also be an important substitute, even for transport fuel, as we have seen in CNG buses, taxis and three-wheelers. Due to the increased availability of natural gas, most cities will be served by piped gas instead of LPG, with the latter provided to rural households as a clean cooking fuel. Most rural households cook with biomass-based fuels such as wood and dung, which cause much indoor air pollution and lead to respiratory diseases, eye infections and premature deaths - by some estimates, as many as half a million death a year.\u000a\u000aThe dual threat of high oil prices and climate change has stimulated action towards energy efficiency around the world. In fact, the younger generations, feeling the burden of climate change, will push even harder for energy efficiency and renewable energy.\u000a\u000aSo how do we replace coal? Alternatives that greatly reduce carbon emissions are nuclear and solar energy. Their carbon emissions come from the construction of the plant and equipment manufacture, but not from the plants themselves.\u000a\u000aWe are, unfortunately, short on nuclear fuel, with domestically available uranium enough to run over their lifetime only 10,000 MW of first-generation nuclear plants of the type we have today. To put that in perspective, our installed capacity in the country is currently about 170,000 MW and the projected requirement for 2030 is about 800,000 to 1 million MW. However, our strategy is to build fast breeder reactors that can run on the plutonium and depleted uranium produced by the first-generation plants as they generate electricity. The fast breeder reactor in turn generates more plutonium than is put in. Thus it breeds plutonium, as the name implies, and after eight to 10 years, there is enough plutonium to start a new breeder reactor. This way, when fully recycled with the domestically available uranium, we could set up and operate 500,000 MW of fast breeders. The catch is that this takes time and, over the next 20 years, based only on our own resources of uranium, we could set up no more than 50,000 MW of nuclear plants.\u000a\u000aOf course with the agreement with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, we could import uranium as well as first-generation plants and nuclear capacity could be created earlier.\u000a\u000aIn the third stage, the fastbreeders are used to convert thorium to uranium 233, which is a fissile isotope, and then run nuclear plants on it. We have vast amount of thorium and the ultimate capacity could be as large as 5 million MW.\u000a\u000aGiven the timeline for developing a nuclear plant, solar energy becomes our most readily available energy resource. With just 10 million hectares of land covered with today's commercially available photovoltaic cells with an efficiency of 15%, we could collect all the projected energy requirements of 2035. The land could be desert land or other unproductive land and there would be no competition with food production. Unfortunately, the cost of this electricity is around Rs 13 per kilowatt hour (kWhr), compared to Rs 3 per kWhr for power generated by coal-based plants. With technical progress and mass production, the costs could be brought down. Thus the primary objective of our solar mission is to make the cost of solar energy comparable to the cost of coal-based energy by 2020. In order to do this, the first 20,000 MW would need to be subsidised in a way that encouraged innovation and cost reduction. I feel confident that we will make solar cost-competitive to coal by 2020 or soon after.\u000a\u000aOnce we have abundant power, we can think of using it to produce hydrogen, which can be used as a transport fuel. Also, if the technology could be developed to cheaply convert solar energy directly into hydrogen, one could even envision small power packs that could be mounted on the roof to supply electricity for lighting at night and hydrogen to run the car as well. This could be as revolutionary a game-changer as the cellphone. Such a development is feasible, but one cannot count on it to come about soon enough. Transforming Energy\u000a\u000aGiven the limited hydrocarbon resources of the country, even if there were no threat of climate change, it would be imperative that we develop solar technology for power and cellulosic ethanol for transport fuel. I am confident that we will see these get developed over the next decade or so, heralding a transformation of the country's energy sector.\u000a\u000a(Kirit Parikh is the chairman of independent research institute Integrated Research and Action for Development (IRADe) and former member of the Planning Commission)\u000a\u000aThe views expressed by the author are personal

Enter the threat of carbon tariffs, actions that France and the steel industry have been arguing will give the EU more leverage.\u000a\u000aHowever, the EU\u2019s designated trade commissioner, Karel de Gucht, has publicly warned that such moves could set off a global trade war, making it a doubtful tactic under the current circumstances.\u000a\u000aInstead, Europe\u2019s main strategy going forward, according to ECF\u2019s Brooks, will be to focus less on the grand sweep of global leadership and more on the less glamorous but pragmatic work of \u201cgetting on with the internal processes of low carbon prosperity\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Copenhagen Accord has ensured that the foreseeable future will be about national actions,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThe greatest hope for the EU\u2019s claims to leading the climate change fight, other analysts say, is for it to focus on developing low-carbon technologies and figuring out how best to reduce conflicts between economic growth and environmental sustainability.\u000a\u000aHowever, the ironic flip side is that the more successful Europe is at reducing its own carbon emissions, the smaller a part of the global problem it will represent, making it less, rather than more, relevant in the global climate change debate.\u000a\u000aMoreover, it will do little to allay the suspicion in the developing world that Europe\u2019s climate evangelising has more to do with the self-interested protection of privilege than the do-gooding pieties it lays claim to.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy does Europe define climate change, which may or may not have effects in the future, as the burning issue of the day rather than the 1.8 million children who die of diarrhoea every year?\u201d asks a negotiator from one of the BASIC countries.\u000a\u000aOthers say the idea of a peaking year for global emissions, something pushed for by Europe, will only serve to lock-in the disparities between the economically privileged status enjoyed by the EU and the deprived circumstances of the majority of the population in the developing world.\u000a\u000aThese are issues that remain largely unaddressed or even acknowledged in the rash of post-Copenhagen post-mortems that Brussels continues to host. But, until the EU addresses these effectively, its ambitions to climate change leadership are not likely to succeed on the basis of technological innovation alone.

a((VImage: Stockxpert Leaders from around the globe met at the World Future Energy Summit last month in Abu Dhabi to talk about contemporary energy issues. One of the topics on their agenda was energy security, an important matter for businesses.\u000a\u000aTo wit, how is a growing long-term supply of energy going to be guaranteed? Is your company thinking about the stability of its long-term energy supply?\u000a\u000aWith global events such as the 1973 oil crisis and the record highs in energy prices in 2007 and 2008, countries have been looking to make their energy sources more secure. Eastern European countries are nervous after the Russia-Ukraine gas disputes in 2006, 2007 and again in 2009. Countries in Central Asia and the Balkans are scaling up infrastructure development of gas pipes to diversify their risk away from Russian gas. In Poland, risk management means the development of biomass. Political issues aside, even the US is responding to West Asia\u2019s energy security concerns by funding the incredibly expensive and environmentally destructive Alberta tar sands oil project in Canada, and is investigating biomass.\u000a\u000aThere is also the debate about peak oil\u2014the point in time in which the world reaches the maximum rate of petroleum extraction, something that would trigger a terminal decline in production. There is much speculation about peak oil, with many sources suggesting it has already hit Japan\u2014a country previously wholly dependent on imported oil, which has now transitioned to nuclear energy and gas. The UK turned to their North Sea oil reserves to once again become a net energy exporter. Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have sovereign wealth funds to help support their transition to a non-oil economy once they begin to run dry.\u000a\u000aCountries are hitting two birds with one stone by scaling up renewable energy as a solution to both the energy security issue and climate change. After all, the idea of a never-ending supply of energy is appealing, isn\u2019t it? Recently, Germany, the UK, France, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands announced a \u20ac30 billion collaboration to link up wind, tidal and hydro plants in the North Sea to contribute 100GW of power, equivalent to just under half the total power generated from coal in the US. In Chile, public-private partnerships with European energy companies are aiming to bring stability to an energy supply that is currently dependent on Bolivia, which is politically unstable, and Argentina, a country facing its own energy security issues.\u000a\u000aThe implications of increasingly risky and uncertain energy supplies to business are paramount. Business is left with two options: to leave this to governments (as it is traditionally their responsibility), or to take matters into its own hands.\u000a\u000aIt is our opinion that businesses need to start preparing for future energy issues. Governments can only take us so far. In the US, for example, the innovation system is fundamentally flawed. The US government is providing billions to fund research and development and create new technologies. However, power suppliers are not adopting these technologies. In the US, for a technology to be adopted by municipal utility companies, it must be proven to work. But how is an energy innovation proven if it is not adopted first?\u000a\u000aWith governments struggling with their own systemic issues, energy supplies will become expensive if not scarce. Soon businesses will not be able to expect low energy prices and easy availability and therefore will need to sacrifice existing consumption pleasures. So if they want to maintain equivalent levels of consumption in the future, businesses would need to start compensating the lack of energy coming from the grid.\u000a\u000aBusinesses must do two things: become more energy efficient and/or buy energy generators for themselves, preferably renewable.\u000a\u000aCompanies will need to be smarter and more economical about energy usage. They need to shed the notion that energy is infinite. Consider Yahoo\u2019s Silicon Valley office: When it gets hot and there is pressure on California\u2019s energy infrastructure, Yahoo sacrifices personal comfort and turns the air conditioning down.\u000a\u000aLighting, computer screens and air conditioning or heating are the three most energy intensive areas of an office. Here are some practical tips to lower this usage:\u000a\u000a\u2022 install the most efficient lighting with a motion sensor and run campaigns about switching off monitors;\u000a\u000a\u2022 have an external energy auditor or volunteer analyse business to find out exactly where your electricity usage is coming from;\u000a\u000a\u2022 develop your own mini-sources of energy. There is a fast growing market for small solar or wind energy generators for offices, homes and factories. You will find returns on this investment within five years.\u000a\u000aSuch examples of businesses taking matters into their own hands are growing substantially in the last couple of years. In fact, pioneers are seeing the potential for business\u2014not government\u2014to take a large role in the development of the renewable energy sector. By taking matters into its own hands and supporting renewable energy, business can reduce its long-term energy supply and expense risks.\u000a\u000aCorey Billington and Darren Willman are professor of operations management and procurement, and research associate, respectively, at IMD, Switzerland.

Her green conscience has only grown stronger since then.\u000a\u000aUnder its influence, Ghuge has now undertaken the ambitious task of mapping the carbon footprint of her college. Her initiative is among the 52 entries shortlisted for the Hindustan Times\u2013Brightest Young Climate Leaders.\u000a\u000aA carbon footprint is the total green house gas emission caused by an organisation, event or product. It is usually expressed in terms of amount of carbon dioxide and or greenhouse gas.\u000a\u000aMapping Miranda House\u2019s footprint is Ghuge\u2019s first green initiative and it could prove quite tedious.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not as easy as, say, calculating the carbon footprint of your house, where you only need basic information such as electricity and fuel consumption,\u201d said the Economics (Honours) student.

After the mapping, she plans propose ways to reduce carbon footprint. To help her, Ghuge has roped in 15 other students. \u201cThe response to the notice I had put up in college was overwhelming.

a((VParadigm shift: Milap Chand Sharma says the notable thing about the Himalayan glaciers controversy is that it\u2019s brought attention to glaciology. Pradeep Gaur/Mint\u000a\u000aUpdated: Sun, Feb 14 2010. 11 51 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: Milap Chand Sharma looks more like a mountaineer than a glaciologist. His tall, muscular frame and rugged looks don\u2019t belong to the small office in New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Its confines, the stacks of papers, the intermittent ringing of the telephone and the occasional visitor seem to irritate him. He only smiles when talk turns to glaciers.\u000a\u000aThese might be turbulent times for most glaciologists, but not for Sharma. Apart from a few newspaper clippings that lie strewn across his desk, there\u2019s little evidence in his office of the maelstrom the small, tight-knit community finds itself in.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s less about science, more about research funding,\u201d he says dismissively of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on the melting of Himalayan glaciers. Then he turns impatiently to his computer screen, across which snakes the majestic form of the Gangotri glacier. \u201cThe controversy has been created by people who have little understanding of glaciers, and have rarely ventured to them.\u201d Glaciology, like the glaciers it studies is, he says emphatically, a \u201cslow and laborious\u201d science, not prone to sudden changes.\u000a\u000aGlaciers are more than just distant objects of scientific study for Sharma.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re living forms that he grew up with in the \u201cone-house\u201d village of Yangkarting in Himachal Pradesh\u2019s remote Lahaul district. They were the source of water to the surrounding villages and the subject of local folk songs and stories.\u000a\u000aHis drift towards a formal engagement with them started early. It was intertwined with a love for mountaineering. In school in Manali, Sharma did a course on snow and ice, his \u201cfirst involvement\u201d as he calls it. In college, he chose to study geography. The choice was easy. \u201cWhere I come from nothing is more important than geography,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aAt around the same time, he started acquiring the mountaineering skills that he\u2019d need for climbing, measuring and living on glaciers. While in college, he did a course in basic mountaineering at Manali\u2019s Western Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. Later, as a student at JNU, he completed the gruelling advanced mountaineering course.\u000a\u000aBy the time he\u2019d finished his master\u2019s degree, Sharma was certain that he\u2019d like to focus on glaciers.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d hoped to go to the University of London to study Arctic glaciers, but on the urging of his \u201cguru\u201d, glaciologist Lewis Owen, decided to work on Gangotri, the largest glacier in the Greater Himalayan Range. \u201cIts social and historical relevance made it one of the best glaciers to study,\u201d explains Sharma.\u000a\u000aCharting the recent changes in the glacier was straightforward. The position of the snout was mapped and compared with previous photographs and records; and stakes were planted to monitor changes in precipitation at different points.\u000a\u000aBut recreating its history, as he discovered, was far more complicated. \u201cEach glacier is a different creature,\u201d says Sharma animatedly. Each expands and retreats in distinct ways, erodes the mountains it flows down differently, and due to the differences in terrain, each has a different set of markers that provide clues to its habits.\u000a\u000aParadigm shift: Milap Chand Sharma says the notable thing about the Himalayan glaciers controversy is that it\u2019s brought attention to glaciology. Pradeep Gaur/Mint The best indicators of historic glacial movement, says Sharma explaining the process, are the lateral moraines, or deposits of debris, that accumulate along a glacier\u2019s edge. A technique called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) allows glaciologists to date when the inner layers of this debris were last exposed to sunlight. That corresponds to the time when the glacier first started retreating from an area.\u000a\u000aSharma used the technique in conjunction with another known as cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) dating which, in contrast to OSL, is used to determine when a surface was first exposed to sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s best applied to the beautifully rounded polished rocks that glaciers reveal when they retreat,\u201d he says. Dating a rock that once lay in the centre of a glacier\u2019s path, where the accumulation of ice is the maximum, gives the time by which its retreat was complete.\u000a\u000aTaken together, OSL and CRN determine the upper and lower time frames of glacial retreat. The challenge, says Sharma, lies in differentiating the moraines from the similar erosion formations and in identifying glacial rocks. \u201cIt takes a lot of training to do that,\u201d says Sharma, pointing to a photograph of an assortment of rocks which, to the untrained eye, look much the same.\u000a\u000aUsing the techniques, Sharma has, among other things, been able to show that the Gangotri glacier retreated from the present location of Gangotri town somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago.\u000a\u000aCreating a complete movement map of Gangotri involved travelling the length of the ablation or melt zone, which extended to 60% of a glacier\u2019s length. It was a traverse of nearly 18km involving almost vertical ascents, negotiating hidden crevasses and nights spent camping in sub-zero temperatures. Each expedition lasted nearly three weeks and required a huge number of porters. \u201cFalls and broken bones were common,\u201d says Sharma matter-of-factly.\u000a\u000aAn hour into the conversation, Sharma is in his element. Then his mobile phone rings. \u201cThe one thing a glaciologist should not have,\u201d he says, shaking his head, \u201cis a family\u201d. His flow of thought is disturbed, but only momentarily.\u000a\u000aAll the ground measurements were incorporated into a complex overlay of aerial photographs and topographic sheets. \u201cOn their own though, neither aerial photographs nor topographic sheets are of any use,\u201d says Sharma. The best available aerial photographs for India, he says, have a resolution of 23.5m, \u201cway too high a margin of error for a glaciologist\u201d; it\u2019s also difficult to distinguish the glacier from seasonal snows in them. And Survey of India topographic sheets are peppered with inaccuracies.\u000a\u000aAccording to him, there\u2019s no replacement for ground surveying. So over the last 20 years, Sharma and his students at the geography department at JNU\u2019s School of Social Sciences have trudged across glaciers around the country, poking, prodding and sliding their way to scientific certainty.\u000a\u000aThey undertake a couple of monitoring trips every year. A few glaciers such as Gangotri are visited almost every alternate year, others less frequently.\u000a\u000aApart from Gangotri, they\u2019ve been monitoring Menthosa, Sonapani, Hamta and the Miyar group of glaciers in Lahaul, Kafni in Kumaon, Kalapani in Garhwal, Stok Kangri in Ladakh and Zemu in Sikkim. All of them are beautiful, but Sharma\u2019s favourite is Kedar Bamak, a two-day climb from Gangotri.\u000a\u000aThe group has also been examining local history and habitations for clues about glacial movements. Dating the remains of wooden houses near Tharang village, 2km from Miyar glacier, has helped corroborate the data from OSL and CRN measurements; and in Lahaul, a folk tale from Gushal village, describing a period of drought, has provided indication of glacial melt in the region.\u000a\u000aThe work might be slow and painstaking, but there\u2019s been plenty of excitement. Sharma has been stalked by giant Himalayan black bears, trapped by snow and rain for weeks on end, and has helped in the discovery of an Indian Air Force plane that crashed on South Dhaka glacier in 1968.\u000a\u000aThe results? \u201cWe\u2019ve got a historical record dating back to 60,000 years for Gangotri and 40,000 years for some of the glaciers in Lahaul,\u201d says Sharma, beaming. Those records have allowed him to compare recent glacial changes with those that took place earlier.\u000a\u000aHe admits that over the last 20 years most glaciers in the Indian Himalayas have been retreating, but similar (and much bigger) changes, he protests, have occurred many times in the past. The current changes could just be part of a natural cycle.\u000a\u000aMany more glaciers would, he believes, need to be studied before any conclusions can be arrived at. \u201cGlaciology is a very nascent science in India,\u201d he says. Of the 9,575 glaciers listed in the inventory of the Geological Survey of India, only 30 or so are tracked on a regular basis.\u000a\u000aSharma seems to be doing his bit. In a life intertwined with that of glaciers, he has already moved on to the next white strand of rock and ice. Over the next few years, he\u2019s going to be working with the National Geographic Society to chart the \u201cpast, present and future glaciers\u201d of the Nanda Devi National Park. It\u2019s an area he hasn\u2019t worked in earlier, and his excitement is apparent.\u000a\u000aThe Indian government is pitching in by establishing the Indian Institute of Glaciology. \u201cThe great thing about the current controversy is that it\u2019s brought attention to glaciology,\u201d says Sharma wryly. \u201cHopefully, some of my students will now finally get jobs.\u201d\u000a\u000aakshai.j@livemint.com

a((VNEW DELHI: The PM's special envoy on climate change, Shyam Saran , is set to be elevated to the rank of minister of state. Sources confirmed the move to redesignate the ex-foreign secretary, who after his part in the nuclear deal, is also seen as a key figure in India's climate diplomacy.The decision to make the 1970 batch IFS officer has been taken in view of Shiv Shankar Menon, three years junior in service, taking charge as national security advisor. Also an ex-foreign secretary, Menon has MoS rank as was the case with his predecessor M K Narayanan.The step-up for Saran means the PM is keen to retain him in his office and is read as a vote of confidence in the hard-nosed approach the former diplomat has advocated. He has, of course, been an articulate defender of the shift in India's position on voluntary emission cuts, but has at times been more cautious than environment minister Jairam Ramesh.There will be a degree of incongruity in his being MoS while Ramesh is also MoS with independent charge. There is speculation that this may be set right whenever a reshuffle occurs since, as an official said, Saran cannot be seen on the same footing as a minister who addresses a wide range of domestic and international agenda.Ramesh has led the `flexible' line on climate change and the two are known to have suggested divergent prescriptions for India's negotiating stance at the formal and informal negotiations. But it is Ramesh's approach that altered India's stance on key issues, which has garnered more support. The minister has since clearly said that he enjoys the PM's mandate and that India had to make the right signals on cuts ahead of the Copenhagen conference to avoid looking like a holdout.While the minister initially appeared to believe, some felt, that India sign on to the Copenhagen Accord, Saran had advised the government to move cautiously. In the event, the government preferred to convey its domestic and voluntary actions to reduce climate changing emissions to the UN climate convention without associating itself with the accord -- as the UN secretary general and industrialised countries desired.Saran is also seen as having pushed hard and got the 20,000 mw solar mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change off the ground when several other initiatives have floundered. Saran's elevation, meanwhile, is bound to stir great interest in international climate circles where differences in the Indian camp are closely followed.

That is incorrect. There is no doubt that the glaciers are melting at a rapid rate. Unfortunately, there has been very little research done on this in our country. Not enough measurements have been taken. This could cause the rivers in north India to flood. There is a huge possibility that floods and droughts could rise. [We have seen] floods in Rajasthan which never experienced flooding,\u201d he said, driving home the problem of water scarcity.\u000a\u000aIn a veiled defence of his position in the aftermath of the controversy, Mr. Pachauri said: \u201cThere are still some people who think outside the ambit of science and disbelieve the phenomenon of global warming. Some powerful vested interests don\u2019t wish to bring about a change in their lifestyles. When I raise my voice on the ill-effects [of climate change] on the poor, they don\u2019t like [that view].\u201d\u000a\u000aReferring to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s backing, Mr. Pachauri said: \u201cThis country has nurtured me and I hope the Indian citizens will support me. Some days ago our Prime Minister gave me his blessings at a summit on sustainable development in Delhi. I am saying all this [on global warming and climate change] because the Indian people are a wise lot. If we see the signs, we can adopt measures and give a better future to our children.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Pachauri warned that Mumbai faced a risk of rising sea-levels. \u201cThe IPCC has predicted that the precipitation patterns like rainfall and snowfall are changing. The Mumbai floods of 2005 were an example of that. Such incidents are happening all over the world. Those who deny climate change would point to the heavy snowfall in Europe. The IPCC has predicted that such extreme precipitation events like heavy rain or snowfall will be on the rise.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Pachauri also spoke of the 2003 heatwave in Andhra Pradesh. \u201cThere were 4,000 recorded deaths. Victims did not know of oral rehydration therapy. Since mobiles were not much in use, we had no means of warning people.\u201d\u000a\u000aChief Minister Ashok Chavan vowed that Maharashtra would be an aggressor in achieving the goals of sustainable development. He said the government was thinking on the lines of mandating energy efficiency for building projects.

It sets a target for each category and outlines a method of achieving that. The Code proposes to conduct waste management in a \u201cclosed loop\u201d system.\u000a\u000aThe government will also plant two million tree saplings and five million potted plants this year.

a((VSuruchi Bhadwal, Lead Author, IPCC AR4 and Fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)\u000a\u000aApropos your article in the Hindustan Times of February 15, 2010 of the above title, that results in a gross misrepresentation of facts.\u000a\u000aAs a lead author to the WGII Fourth Assessment Report, I can say that the procedures adopted by the IPCC have been very clear which begins with a transparent process of nomination of experts by country focal points in Ministries from each country to contribute to report writing. These have been in existence since 1990 and followed systematically from the time of the First Assessment Report.\u000a\u000aThe media needs to learn more about the IPCC and its processes before it refutes it openly in the manner it has done of late. A well established intergovernmental body with thousands of scientists worldwide contributing to its reports, the IPCC report assimilates within it a balanced, yet conservative, understanding of the state of knowledge on the science related to climate change and its consequent impacts. The report therefore is the most comprehensive compilation of the various dimensions of climate change and no single person, no matter of how impeccable a science background, can claim to have a full understanding of this output.\u000a\u000aThe criticisms reported in the media provided by leads from climate sceptics have been proven to be generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment. Media criticism on the use of non-journal literature by authors does not investigate the reasons behind inclusion of that literature, done basically with the concern to avoid loss of valuable information in areas where there has been limited research and reporting in peer reviewed journals especially in case of vulnerability assessments, and adaptation and reported literature from developing countries. As an IPCC author, I would urge you to exercise caution when making sweeping pronouncements on either product or process.\u000a\u000aEven the recently identified case on sea-level rise in the Netherlands has been since corrected by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency that has said that \u201cIn the 2007 IPCC report by the Working group 2 (Climate change 2007: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability) a mistake has entered the text that was supplied by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, regarding the risks of flooding for the Netherlands\u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aMr Chauhan needs to remember that the IPCC is a network organisation wherein all the scientists associated from different parts of the world and from different disciplines are not employees of the organisation. Their allegiance is largely to the science and the process adopted ensures its own checks and balances. It also needs to be reiterated that these reports are reviewed extensively both internally as well as externally and the drafts of each chapter of all the reports are kept in the public domain for comments. Comments are received from several sources including scientists, academia and governments which then get duly addressed by the authors.\u000a\u000aAfter this process, the Summary for Policy Makers of each Working Group Report also gets reviewed by country delegations word by word in a plenary to allow for final approval of the text.\u000a\u000aIt seems that the intensity of research and expert contributions have been grossly underestimated in the media reports. I hope you will correct your reportage and also publish my letter in full.\u000a\u000aChetan Chauhan replies\u000a\u000aNowhere does the story claim that IPCC\u2019s review process is flawed, even though the UN body has admitted to mistakes on Himalayan glaciers and sea levels in the Netherlands, and for which Suruchi Bhadwal has provided an explanation. The claim on the Netherlands was based on an IPCC note to news agencies AFP and Reuters, where the UN body admitted to wrongly stating that 55 per cent of the Netherlands is below sea level. Bhadwal acknowledges it was a mistake, attributing it to the Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency. This is an issue the IPCC\u2019s peer-review process needs to address.\u000a\u000aAs for the claim that I challenged the IPCC\u2019s review process, Bhadwal has only read the headline and not the story. Nowhere the report says that the IPCC\u2019s scientific process is flawed. The news report was based on an IPCC letter to national governments.\u000a\u000aOn the point that IPCC is a multinational body with representation from institutes of individual nations, the story only refers to the letter and does not say that the IPCC is not a multinational body. Bhadwal has not refuted any specifics of the letter reported in the story, instead issuing a general criticism of media reportage of the IPCC process. I fail to see how the story has misrepresented facts.

a((VWhat do the sub-prime crisis, the controversies over and the acrimonious disputes over have in common? All three are a product of methodological weaknesses in the way in which risk and uncertainty have been handled in the relevant debates and decisions.\u000a\u000aThe illustrates the hazards of an \u201cother things remaining constant\u201d approach to risk assessment. A portfolio of mortgages was evaluated by aggregating the default risks of each individual borrower on the basis of that borrower\u2019s economic characteristics and the historical default data of each borrower class. Mortgages from different risk classes were packaged and the aggregate was evaluated on the assumption that these risks of default are independent. Some insurers provided cover against default and, on the strength of this, rating agencies gave these securities an investment grade.\u000a\u000aBut the default risks were dependent on house prices continuing their upward march. When house prices started falling, all of the borrowers were affected and this systemic risk was not factored into the rating of the portmanteau securities that included \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d mortgages.\u000a\u000aIf the primary source of risk is individual, the risk assessment would have worked the way it works for the risks that life insurance actuaries calculate. But if some external event alters the risk profile of every borrower, this \u201cother things remaining constant\u201d procedure does not work. We have known this in India in the sphere of crop insurance where an adverse event like a drought affects all borrowers. That is why we do not have a viable model for insuring against crop failures.\u000a\u000aDroughts are predictable, at least in a statistical sense. But have been notoriously poor in predicting turning points. An event like the huge drop in house prices that generated the systemic risk for mortgage securities was not predictable in the sense that it fell outside the usual confidence limits of It was what Taleb would call a Black Swan event. This is a risk at the tail end of a probability distribution with low probability but huge costs. How many risk managers had worked out the implications of this possibility in evaluating the mortgage securities?\u000a\u000aThe current controversies over illustrate another problem in the way in which we handle uncertainty. Climate science involves a large degree of uncertainty and the IPCC, to its credit, has been punctilious in giving confidence limits to its assertions. But the public debate is being conducted by replacing this scientific uncertainty with adversarial certainties.\u000a\u000aThe discipline of heuristics has something to say on this. It talks of a prior attitude effect which evaluates supportive evidence and arguments more favourably than contrary indications and also picks and chooses these to suit its case. It also suggests that knowledgeable subjects, because they possess greater ammunition with which to counter-argue incongruent facts and arguments, will be more prone to these biases. One sees these biases both among the climate alarmists and the climate sceptics. When arguments are weak, the proponents also resort to mudslinging, thus diverting attention from the core argument.\u000a\u000aThe mainstream of scientists in the IPCC, however, have been professional and cautious and have come out with a categorical statement about the human impact on global warming only in their third report. The fact that the warming trend has not been observed for some years does not invalidate the science on which the IPCC\u2019s projections rest. Much of the recent scepticism is nitpicking on the periphery of the case. My confidence in the rests on the wide spread of its scientific network and the fact that its basic argument is supported by virtually every National Science Academy that has spoken on the matter and in most peer-reviewed academic articles on the subject.\u000a\u000aThe real case for action on climate is as insurance. The \u201cpathological reports\u201d on the state of health of the climate system have been getting progressively worse. The worst case could involve a catastrophe and horrendous costs. The immediate actions that we need to take are not just low-cost but often have large collateral benefits. Later, if the alarm proves unwarranted, low carbon policies can be relaxed. But the reverse option of undoing past neglect if the prognosis proves to be right would be hugely expensive.\u000a\u000aThe case also illustrates some of these problems when the science is arcane and uncertain so that the lay public is at the mercy of the adversarial experts. The problem also arose because of the lack of confidence in the judgment of the experts in the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee. The minister concerned, Jairam Ramesh, did well to listen to all sides. But he, like the rest of us, was confronted by competing certainties of experts who refused to see the other side of the argument. He did well to come out with a statement that is an object lesson in how such decisions should be presented to the public.\u000a\u000aWhen confronted by risks that cannot be readily calculated by looking at the frequency of past occurrences, it is best to treat probability as a measure of the degree of belief and link it to the availability of evidence. When evidence is scarce, the dispersion of belief can be justifiably wide. As evidence improves, the dispersion of belief should come down. Such an approach would avoid the clash of competing certainties and it stresses the need to mobilise evidence with the clear aim of reducing the spread of belief.\u000a\u000aAn over-simplified view about the predictability of uncertain events, treating linked risks as independent of one another, the peddling of certainties by prejudiced parties and doubts about the objectivity of the experts on whom lay decision-makers have to depend are the common hazards of dialogue and decision when outcomes are uncertain. The answer must lie in investing in more and better evidence to reduce the range of uncertainty, looking not just at individual but also at systemic risks, paying particular attention to potentially catastrophic risks, working hard to maintain an open dialogue, being courageous enough to change one\u2019s views and ensuring that official expert groups that advise on the underlying science include specialists of all persuasions.\u000a\u000aCoping with uncertainty requires the courage to confront the evidence, even when it clashes with one\u2019s preconceptions, and the caution to avoid a catastrophe.\u000a\u000anitin-desai@hotmail.com

She said one of the coal-based power plants in the city has been shut down, the entire road public transport in the city runs on CNG and attempts are being made to have more hybrid vehicles to reduce consumption of diesel and petrol.\u000a\u000aGreen areas\u000a\u000aPointing out that the Delhi Government was creating green areas near various venues for the Games, particularly the Games Village and the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium that would host the athletics events apart from the opening and closing ceremonies, Ms. Dikshit said the focus would be on recycling waste generated during the Games. She said at a time when the green cover of Delhi has been increasing every year, the Organising Committee has also been told to use more recycled paper.\u000a\u000aThe Chief Minister said the Thyagraj Stadium that has been constructed by the Delhi Government has also come up as a green structure with gas-based power plant.\u000a\u000aAsked about pollution in the Yamuna, she said cleaning the river would take time and it cannot be cleaned before the Games.\u000a\u000aGreen vision\u000a\u000aReferring to the Games mascot \u201cShera\u201d, Mr. Kalmadi said: \u201cPedh hai to sher hai\u201d (If there are trees, only then would there be tigers). He spoke about how for a \u201cGreen Games\u201d the Organising Committee had developed a \u201cGreen Games Vision\u201d wherein it would \u201cstrive to reduce consumption and carbon footprint and become the benchmark for the multi-disciplinary games in future\u201d.\u000a\u000aMr. Tharoor said the document would go a long way in enriching the Green Games concept as it has been carefully and diligently prepared to make the event memorable.

The seminar was organised by the Society for Promotion of Science and Technology in India at Panjab University here.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe region shall face problems of fresh water from November to June as well as increased pressure on electricity demand due to high temperatures in summer, which could also mean a possible increase in incidence of malaria, dengue and so on.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Ghosh suggested strict enforcement of the Building Energy Code and environmental regulation guidelines for new structures, retrofitting existing buildings for energy efficiency and water conservation, mandatory water harvesting in all apartment blocks (new and existing) and government/corporate/large buildings, and promotion of energy service companies (ESCOs) to enable energy efficiency/water conservation measures to earn carbon credits.\u000a\u000aReferring to the failure of the Copenhagen summit, he said none of the participating countries was serious about climate change and they were, in fact, \u201cindulging in economic negotiations and future trade patterns\u201d.\u000a\u000aInaugurating the seminar, Punjab Chief Secretary Subodh Aggarwal reiterated the need to take proactive steps to combat global warming.\u000a\u000aHaryana Principal Secretary (Environment) Dr. G.

a((VIsabel Hilton\u000a\u000aClimate policy is stymied by Barack Obama's weakness and Senate recalcitrance.\u000a\u000aIn Delhi last week, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the guru of sustainable development from Columbia University, delivered a sobering message about U.S. climate politics. There was very little chance, he said, that the U.S. would pass climate legislation this year and almost no chance the Senate would ever adopt cap\u2014and\u2014trade, the system by which enterprises trade permits to emit within ever tighter limits. He himself, he added, was not sorry. He strongly preferred a carbon tax as a simpler and more effective mechanism.\u000a\u000aThere are many who share his preference, but the chances of the U.S. legislating such a tax seem equally remote. Besides, if the U.S. turns away from carbon trading, the future of other carbon trading systems seems perilous.\u000a\u000aFor the EU in particular, this is bad news. If Sachs is right, the chances that the Copenhagen accord, a vague statement of intent to limit the global average temperature rise to 2C, will be translated into a legally binding instrument with some chance of achieving that goal become very slim. If the U.S. cannot legislate, it cannot sign or comply with a new treaty. Without the U.S., China and India will not take on legally binding commitments. Without the world's biggest emitters, efforts to limit emissions will fail.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration, according to Sachs, has not abandoned the battle. If it cannot fight a climate bill through the Senate, there are alternatives. One is to go for a simpler energy bill to mandate efficiencies and promote alternatives to fossil fuels, since even the most recalcitrant coal \u2014 state Senators might be persuaded that U.S. dependence on \u201cforeign oil\u201d is a national security weakness. And, in the absence of emissions legislation, the administration can use presidential powers and the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the country's path to a cleaner, greener future.\u000a\u000aBoth are under active consideration. But nothing can disguise the fact that the overarching framework of the Kyoto protocol, with its potential to unlock finance for clean development in the emerging economies, has no future under this scenario. Given the condition of public finances in the developed world, there is little prospect of western taxpayers stepping up with the sums required. Without private sector finance, the framework begins to crumble away.\u000a\u000aKyoto, it is worth remembering, was largely a U.S. invention, the means by which the Clinton administration could discuss financing climate mitigation without mentioning tax. Other nations reluctantly accepted it in order that the U.S., then the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, could be included in the global effort to curb them. But though Clinton signed the treaty, Congress rejected it. Now the U.S. wants to dismantle it, blaming Europe for its inefficiencies and modest achievements.\u000a\u000aIt is not just in Europe that cap-and-trade has supporters. At state level in the U.S., limited forms of it exist: nine north-eastern states have been trading emissions from power plants, and a coalition of seven U.S. states and five Canadian provinces have been working towards building their own cap-and-trade system, due to begin trading in 2012.\u000a\u000aThat initiative, however, also faces trouble. In one member state, Utah, politicians have approved a resolution which implies climate change science is a \u201cconspiracy\u201d. Another, Arizona, dropped out of cap-and-trade plans last week, citing recession as its excuse. And California's impressive climate programme is under attack on similar grounds from Dan Logue, a Republican member of the state assembly. Plus, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is stepping down this year and it is by no means clear a successor will continue his climate policies.\u000a\u000aA year ago, it seemed so different: in his first state of the union address, President Obama advocated an annual investment of $15bn in clean energy research and development. In the economic stimulus package that followed, billions were pledged to energy R&D, while the president's commitment to climate legislation seemed to promise the framework that would ensure such technologies were deployed.\u000a\u000aToday, Mr. Obama's promising vision is faltering at best; the U.S. risks turning its back on the chance to dominate the next technology revolution, and global efforts to accommodate the administration's efforts to put more than a decade of U.S. climate recalcitrance behind it have not met with a corresponding policy delivery from Washington.\u000a\u000aU.S. climate battles seem mired in the administration's political weakness and the Senate's departure from its mission to serve the public interest. This is not just a tragedy for the U.S. We are all hostage to its climate policy. \u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aBarack Obama suffered a setback to his green energy agenda on Tuesday when three major corporations \u2014 including BP America \u2014 dropped out of a coalition of business groups and environmental organisations that had been pressing Congress to pass climate change legislation.\u000a\u000aThe defections by ConocoPhillips, America\u2019s third largest oil company; Caterpillar, which makes heavy equipment; and BP rob the U.S. Climate Action Partnership of three powerful voices for lobbying Congress to pass climate change law.\u000a\u000aThey also undercut Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to cast his climate and energy agenda as a pro-business, job-creation plan. Only hours earlier, Mr. Obama and other Cabinet officials had made a high-profile announcement that $8.3 billion was being awarded in loan guarantees for a company building the first new nuclear reactors in America in nearly 30 years.\u000a\u000aBut the loan decision in favour of Southern Company, which was framed by the White House as a kick-start for new nuclear plants, was upstaged by the departure of the big three firms from the climate partnership.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot enough\u201d\u000a\u000aOfficials from BP and ConocoPhillips said the proposals before Congress for curbing greenhouse gas emissions did not do enough to recognise the importance of natural gas, and were too favourable to the coal industry.\u000a\u000aThe House of Representatives passed a climate change bill last June, but the effort has stalled in the Senate.\u000a\u000a\u201cHouse climate legislation and Senate proposals to date have disadvantaged the transportation sector and its consumers, left domestic refineries unfairly penalised versus international competition, and ignored the critical role that natural gas can play in reducing GHG emissions,\u201d said ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive Jim Mulva in a statement. \u201cWe believe greater attention and resources need to be dedicated to reversing these missed opportunities, and our actions today are part of that effort.\u201d\u000a\u000aOpponents of climate change legislation said the departure of the big three companies had all but killed off Mr. Obama\u2019s last chances of pushing his agenda through Congress.\u000a\u000a\u201cCap-and-trade legislation is dead in the U.S. Congress and that global warming alarmism is collapsing rapidly,\u201d said Myron Ebell, director of global warming for the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\u000a\u000aMr. Obama this week is stepping up White House pressure on Congress with a series of events intended to show the job-creating potential of his green energy agenda. His announcement at a Maryland job training centre of the new nuclear loan guarantees was a key part of the strategy.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though we haven\u2019t broken ground on a new nuclear plant in nearly 30 years, nuclear energy remains our largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cTo meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we\u2019ll need to increase our supply of nuclear power. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d The guarantees would commit the U.S. government to repaying Southern\u2019s loans if the company defaulted. They cover some 70 per cent of the estimated $8.8-billion cost of building two reactors at the company\u2019s Vogtle plant, east of Atlanta.\u000a\u000aWhite House officials said Tuesday\u2019s announcement reinforced Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge in his State of the Union address last month to expand America\u2019s use of nuclear energy and to open up offshore drilling.\u000a\u000aMr. Obama has also asked Congress to triple loan guarantees for the nuclear industry, to $54 billion from the current $18.5 billion.\u000a\u000aThe pledge to the nuclear industry was seen as part of a strategy to win Republican support for the climate and energy bill.\u000a\u000aExpanding nuclear power, which supplies about 20 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity, is one of the few elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s energy and climate agenda to win broad-based support. A number of Republican Senators have demanded Mr. Obama help fund the construction of 100 new nuclear plants over the next decade.\u000a\u000aBut the subsidies have made some Senators as well as environmental organisations uneasy.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a lot of money,\u201d said the Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders who is an independent. \u201cThe construction of new nuclear plants may well be the most expensive way to go.\u201d \u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

a((VDAVID ADAM\u000a\u000aThe scientist at the centre of the storm over mistakes by the UN\u2019s climate change panel has broken his silence to defend his report as \u201crobust and rigorous.\u201d\u000a\u000aMartin Parry, a climate expert at the Grantham Institute and Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College, London, said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d at the way the media has focused on what he called minor points.\u000a\u000aParry was co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) working group on impacts, which produced a 2007 report that included the false claim that Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.\u000a\u000aThe discovery of the mistake, and the way it was handled, has produced calls for IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri to resign. It has also led to reports of further errors in the report, including that the IPCC wrongly stated that 55 per cent of the Netherlands is below sea level. In an open letter sent on February 13 to scientists that prepared the 2007 report from IPCC working group two (WG2), which has been the focus of criticism, Parry says: \u201cWhat began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe adds: \u201cIt is easy to forget the big picture, which is that the WG2 volume represents a sound and reliable statement of our knowledge, and is the product of robust and rigorous assessment by you all.\u201d\u000a\u000aParry said the IPCC had looked into the further alleged mistakes, and that they were \u201cgenerally unfounded.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the Netherlands, he said there were several different figures that could be used, which vary on how the issue is defined. The Dutch Ministry of Transport, he said, uses the figure 60 per cent, which counts land below high water level during storms, while others use 30 per cent, which is land below mean sea level.\u000a\u000aParry also defended IPCC statements on reports of other effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aHe said many of the criticisms were based on a mistaken belief that the IPCC could not use so-called grey literature \u2014 reports from outside academic journals such as from campaign groups.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany such reports are intensively reviewed, both internally and externally. Even if not peer-reviewed, there are reports that contain valuable information.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also defended the time taken by the IPCC to respond to each reported mistake: \u201cEach has involved about a week of investigation and discussion by IPCC authors before a conclusion is published.\u000a\u000aThis is why many colleagues feel our critics are having a \u2019field day\u2019 and the press are not reflecting a balanced picture.\u201d \u2014 © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

Kumar\u000a\u000aSpecial Correspondent\u000a\u000aCHENNAI: Top scientists and policymakers from leading national and international institutes on Wednesday issued a declaration calling on all nations to prioritise conservation of the earth\u2019s multitude of plant, agricultural, forest and marine species or risk widespread hunger and accelerating climate change.\u000a\u000aBiodiverse ecosystems, they stressed, contain naturally evolved genetic strengths and unique food technologies developed by traditional communities in different climates, soils and temperatures. Harnessing and sharing these capabilities equitably will help humanity adapt to rising temperatures and the poorest of the poor feed themselves in harsh climates.\u000a\u000aTo that end, the Chennai Declaration set out a series of strategies that are the product of three days of intense discussion, at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, of the senior representatives from organisations across the world such as the UN Environment Programme, the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation, the International Rice Research Institute, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Food Prize Fund, and India\u2019s National Biodiversity Authority and Ministry of Environment and Forests.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe declaration makes a bridge of issues at global, national and local levels between the challenges for conservation and food security,\u201d said Angela Cropper, Deputy Executive Director, UN Environment Programme.\u000a\u000aThese include: according economic value to the services nature and agriculture rendered and setting up mechanisms for payment for such services; acknowledging that the custodians of biodiverse resources are farmers and fisherfolk; finding markets for neglected but nutritious crops; including rural communities in biodiversity strategies; refocussing research and development priorities and promoting biodiversity literacy through public education to build an ethic of conservation.\u000a\u000aJairam Ramesh, Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests, present at the valedictory session, pledged to take forward the \u201cwonderful ideas\u201d contained in the declaration. He said he would do his best to integrate climate change mitigation strategies with biodiversity conservation in both national policy and in international discussion in Mexico later this year. 2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity.

Its stand is similar to China\u2019s.\u000a\u000aUNFCCC asked nations to clarify their stand on the accord that was thrashed out by 26 countries; the negotiations did not include all the 190 plus countries covered by UNFCCC. Both India and China, along with the US, Brazil and South Africa contributed to the drafting of the accord.\u000a\u000aBrazil has said that it was not in support of the accord as a stand-alone instrument.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe accord was negotiated by 26 leaders but later the language was changed to give it the format of a plurilateral accord, which wasn\u2019t negotiated,\u201d said Prodipto Ghosh, a former environment secretary and part of the Indian negotiating team in Copenhagen.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Danish Prime Minister (Lars Rasmussen) and Ban Ki-Moon (UN secretary general) also wrote letters asking countries to associate with the accord, which was taken as a first step to make it legally binding,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cThis was exactly what was rejected.\u201d\u000a\u000aRasmussen and Ban don\u2019t have the mandate to pursue this document and the interpretation is not acceptable, Ghosh said.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina being strong means India will coordinate with them,\u201d said an official with knowledge of the matter. He spoke on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aBrazil, South Africa, India and China, also known as the BASIC grouping, typically coordinate among themselves on climate change. They met in New Delhi in January to discuss the issue and will again meet in South Africa in March.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy own sense is that the (global) negotiations will be carried out as a matter of form and gain momentum only when the US cap-and-trade Bill is passed,\u201d Ghosh said \u201cTill then, the negotiations will carry on in a fractious and divisive manner.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was referring to the US Clean Energy and Security Bill of 2009, which has been passed by the House of Representatives and awaits approval of the US Senate.\u000a\u000apadmaparna.g@livemint.com

a((VAt the meet in last December, some of the most visible campaigners milling around outside the conference venue were dressed as large, furry animals. As they distributed vegan sandwiches to all who would accept them, their message was simple: \u201cLess meat means less heat.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe policy debates surrounding global warming tend to focus on fossil fuels and carbon emissions. Solutions to climate change, correspondingly, centre on developing renewable energies and increasing efficiency in the transport and building sectors. Far less attention is garnered by the warming consequences of rearing and consuming livestock. In fact, the methane released when ruminants like cows and sheep belch or pass gas, which they do copiously, combined with the indirect emissions associated with their life cycles, contributes 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, even more than the transport sector.\u000a\u000aThis figure was arrived at by a United Nation\u2019s study, conducted in 2006. Yet, meat and dairy consumption continue to suffer from scant mention in most popular expositions of climate change science. Al Gore\u2019s movie, An inconvenient truth, for example, avoids what may be the most inconvenient truth of all, that what\u2019s on the dinner plate can link to climate change as much as driving an SUV.\u000a\u000aThe FAO study took into account both the direct and indirect emissions related to livestock. Thus, emissions arising from feed production, including chemical fertiliser production, deforestation for pasture and feed crops, cultivation of feed crops and feed transport were added to the direct emissions of the animals in question, in particular their enteric fermentation (which results in their passing gas) and the nitrous oxide emissions released from animal urine and manure. Animal waste management and livestock transportation were other aspects accounted for.\u000a\u000aAccording to the FAO, livestock contributes only about nine percent of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but 37 percent of methane and 65 percent of nitrous oxide emissions. This is significant because methane and nitrous oxide cause far greater warming than equivalent amounts of carbon. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP) of 21, meaning a tonne of methane in the atmosphere produces as much warming as 21 tonnes of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Nitrous oxide has a GWP of 310.\u000a\u000aThe FAO study has met with considerable criticism. Mick Keogh, Executive Director of the Australian Farm Institute, lists some of these in a recent article, in which he claims the FAO methodology was faulty, leading to substantial double-counting of emissions. He also objected to the fact that the FAO included emissions from deforestation and desertification as part of the impact of livestock, when much of this activity occurs for non-livestock related reasons. And, while admitting that methane has a far greater warming potential than carbon, he noted that carbon stays in the atmosphere for up to 100 years, whereas methane only lingers for eight to 12 years.\u000a\u000aData from the (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has a much lower figure for livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions. It estimates direct livestock emissions to make up approximately half of total agricultural emissions or some seven percent of global emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe way in which you attribute emissions depends on what your aim is,\u201d says Pierre Gerber an FAO Livestock Policy Officer, explaining the difference in numbers. \u201cOur aim was to find out how much animal production was sufficient to maintain food security while doing the least amount of harm to the environment. In the context of the food security-environment nexus, our methodology was the best.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn even more damning study in the November-December issue of World Watch magazine added fresh fuel to the meat and global warming debate. The report claimed more than half of human-produced greenhouses gases were caused by meat industries.\u000a\u000aThese latest findings are fiercely contested, particularly the fact that they include all carbon dioxide released by livestock during respiration. Nonetheless, advocacy of vegetarianism as the solution to climate change is on the up. Speaking at the European Parliament last December, singer Paul McCartney urged legislators to support citizens in refraining from eating meat one day in the week. He was joined by the chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, who is a vegetarian and recommended the levying of a surcharge on beef as a way of reducing consumption.\u000a\u000aThe Australian Farm Institute\u2019s Keogh, lashed at Pachauri, saying that the emphasis on meat rather than dairy betrayed the bias of his home country, India. India is home to the world\u2019s largest national cattle herd, and rapidly increasing levels of per capita dairy consumption, although many Indians are vegetarian. \u201cPerhaps the dairy industry has been ignored because \u2018less ice-cream means less heat\u2019 might be harder to sell to consumers,\u201d said Keogh.\u000a\u000aBut, the FAO says its policy recommendations apply equally to dairy and meat. \u201cThere is a substantial impact by livestock on the environment,\u201d says Gerber. \u201cThat is a fact. Governments need to find ways to minimise that impact by more efficient management of animal waste and feed production.\u201d\u000a\u000aGerber also says it is possible to reduce the direct emissions of ruminants by making changes to their diet. \u201cIn India, on the whole, the yield of a cow is very low. If you can improve yields, then you can have fewer cows for the same amount of milk, which will reduce total emissions. Breed and feed are the two determinants that impact yield.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe FAO will be publishing a new study at the end of the year, including the latest research that has been conducted over the past three years. It will stress that technologies are already out there that could help mitigate the impact of livestock on climate.\u000a\u000aOne such innovative project is currently being undertaken by Australia\u2019s Cooperative Research Centre for Sheep Industry Innovation, where scientists are attempting to identify sheep that are genetically predisposed to less flatulence.

a((VMUMBAI: L&T is going in for a major change in its energy business focus. The country\u2019s largest engineering company, which is mainly identified with large, thermal-fired power projects \u2014 virtually almost every power plant in India was built by L&T \u2014 is going green by venturing into wind and hydro power generation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Mumbai-based company has prepared a road map for building wind power projects in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu for captive use. In addition, it is also investing around Rs 8,000 crore for setting up 700-800 MW of hydro power projects in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh, according to a senior executive. The projects would go on stream in the next four-five years.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have evaluated prospects of clean energy for corporate sustainability by scaling up captive consumption of renewable energy and exploring more opportunity in hydro power projects,\u201d R Shankar Raman, senior vice-president (finance) told ET.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSuch initiatives will provide tariff relief and also add carbon credit to L&T\u2019s balance sheet. According to the government norms, L&T will get tariff relief on the equal amount of the energy being generated through renewable resources for captive use.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor example, if L&T sets up 10 MW through wind or any other renewable energy plant, it will get tariff relief on an additional 10 MW being sourced from the state grid.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn addition, L&T could also receive carbon credits under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Once approved, these units are termed as Certified Emission Reductions, or CERs. Carbon credit is a generic term that implies a value assigned to the company, which contributes toward reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCER is considered equivalent to one metric tonne of CO2 emissions that could be sold privately or in the international market at prevailing market price.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aL&T is also looking to invest in about 5,000 MW thermal power capacity based on super-critical technology, which has higher fuel-efficiency with low emissions. The engineering conglomerate is also in the process of bidding several hydro power projects in the hill states of the country and in neighbouring countries such as Nepal and Bhutan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe company has opted for wind energy for compensating its captive usage in the country. For its facilities in southern region of the country, L&T has placed its first wind energy order of over Rs 52 crore to the country\u2019s largest wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon Energy, earlier this week.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSuzlon will set up a 8.7-MW wind energy project in Tamil Nadu. The project is scheduled to be completed and commissioned before the end of the current fiscal, and the power generated will be wheeled for the group\u2019s facilities in the region.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSimilarly, the group will also build other wind projects in Maharashtra and Gujarat, where most of the group facilities are located.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aK Venkatesh, executive vice-president of L&T\u2019s developmental projects sector, said the company is in the process of identifying appropriate locations based on high-efficiency of wind and machine availability. \u201cWe are keen to invest in renewable energy where ever there is an opportunity and which will enhance viability of our projects and earn carbon credits, as per as available regulatory norms,\u201d said Mr Raman.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

a((VNEW DELHI: With a concerted effort to question the intensity of climate impact, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chairman R K Pachauri talks with ET about the high cost of undermining the findings of science.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHow do you, as IPCC chief, view the Copenhagen Accord?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aStatus of accord is not clear. There is some sense of intent, particularly the intent of some countries. There are elements for building on what was agreed to by some countries. Of course, to extend this understanding to all the countries presents a daunting challenge.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Accord refers to the 2 degrees celsius temperature threshold, however there is complete silence on specific emission reduction targets. As IPCC chief are you satisfied with the acknowledgement given to science?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor the first time the UNFCCC community accepted the principle of 2 degrees celsius. This flows out of the IPCC fourth assessment report, and is an acknowledgement of the impact of climate change and the attractiveness of mitigation action. However, there is total disregard for the emission reduction required to ensure that the temperature threshold is met. As I pointed out at the recent Delhi Sustainable Development Summit, if we don\u2019t bring about this reduction then we will reach overshoot scenario. If we continue to increase emission, it will lead to a temperature increase of beyond the 2 degrees threshold. At that time, we will have to take more stringent action, which will be more expensive and the impact of climate change will be even more drastic. This would be undesirable. I have consistently said it is better to take a long-term view and take measures now to stabilise temperature.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBetween now and Mexico, how do you see the IPCC reinforcing this idea that emission must be cut drastically and that the developed world will have to take the lead?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI have been speaking to the developed world about the plight of the developing world. This is what forms the ethical basis for developed countries to give assistance to developing countries. Between now and Mexico, I plan to draw attention to the fact that it is important to realise the disadvantages of inaction and the attractiveness of action.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is not mere rhetoric. There are several economic models which bear this out. Take Japan, following the oil price shock of the seventies, Japan seriously undertook the task of radically restructuring their economy. This formed the basis of their growth. More recently, Germany has undertaken an aggressive renewable energy programme. Korea has a green growth programme. There are enough details for developing a different energy path, and its benefits in areas like agriculture.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the road to Mexico I plan to address groups of government, civil society, the public and stakeholders and draw attention to the benefits of action.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScience has been the basis of the negotiating strength of the developing countries. However, a series of reports are now questioning the intensity of the climate change outlined by the IPCC report. Weakening the science only serves to undermine negotiating strength. How does IPCC plan to ensure that the intensity of climate change is mapped out better?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe IPCC will work to strengthen the hands of sane elements. The recent spate of reports is part of a concerted effort to undermine science through trivial issues. The attacks have increased especially as there is a renewed political commitment to deal with climate change. There is now a US president who is committed to taking action on climate change, that is big move from the eight years of the Bush administration. The IPCC is ready to listen to any ideas to strengthen it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy questioning the intensity of climate change, there is an effort to lower the quantity of finance that is required to be made available to developing countries to deal with climate change. How does the IPCC plan to step in to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe emphasis of the IPCC is to carry out scientific analysis that is policy-relevant. There are countries that don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with impacts of climate change. In that sense the implications of climate change are far greater for the prosperous countries. In the Netherlands, 26% of land is under sea level and 29% is prone to flooding, given the lack of capacity. There is a need to realise that some countries face the real prospect of becoming failed states. We need to create an understanding that we are all together on this spaceship earth. And beyond a point we can\u2019t go on as we are now. There is a need to convince the public, especially in the developed countries of these realities.

a((VKOLKATA: The World Wildlife Fund has warned that days are numbered for much of the sensitive Sunderbans eco-system and in 60 years vast tracts of the rare mangrove forests, home to the Bengal tiger , will be inundated by the rising sea.The study, focussed on Sunderbans in Bangladesh, says the sea was rising more swiftly than anticipated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 and would rise 11.2 inches (above 2000 levels) by 2070. This would result in shrinkage of the Bangladesh Sunderbans by 96% within half a century, reducing the tiger population there to less than 20, said the study.Unlike previous efforts, WWF's deputy director of conservation science Colby Loucks and his colleagues used a high-resolution digital elevation model with eight estimates of sea level rise to predict the impact on tiger habitat and population size. The team was able to come up with the most accurate predictions till date by importing over 80,000 Global Positioning System (GPS) elevation points.The study, Sea Level Rise and Tigers: Predicted Impacts to Bangladesh's Sunderbans Mangroves, has been published in the journal, Climatic Change. Though the Indian part of the Sunderbans will not be so badly affected, conservationists wonder how many tigers would be able to survive here with nearly 60% of the habitat gone. Of the total Sunderbans, nearly 60% is in Bangladesh. Tigers do not recognize international borders though and cross over from one side to the other as and when they choose.Experts say that every tiger requires a large territory of its own (known as range). An ever-spreading human habitat in the Indian part has already resulted in a drop in the big cats' territory, leading to frequent incidents of straying.``Tigers have adapted to a life in the mangroves and crabs constitute an important part of their diet. Though tigers are a highly adaptable species, occupying territory from the snowy forests of Russia to the tropics of Indonesia, the projected sea level rise in the Sunderbans may outpace the animal's ability to adapt,'' a WWF source said. There are no accurate estimates, but conservationists estimate the mangroves could be home to upto 400 big cats.The sea level rise will also have an impact on the lives of people who depend on the Sunderbans for their livelihood. The mangroves protect human habitation from cyclones and other natural disasters.WWF has recommended that governments and natural resource managers take immediate steps to conserve and expand mangroves while preventing poaching and retaliatory killing of tigers. Neighbouring countries should increase sediment delivery and freshwater flows to the coastal region to support agriculture and replenishment of the land.

a((VNEW DELHI: With Shyam Saran 's exit, the government could now be looking at a change in the core climate negotiating team, which guides India's stance in international talks. The move, which has been pending at the level of the PMO for months now, could become the first clear signal after the Copenhagen talks of where PM Manmohan Singh stands on the climate tussle between the `flexibility' brigade and those wary of the elasticity of policy Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh has come to represent.While the shakeup in the core team, formed in March 2008 by the orders of the cabinet secretary when the institutional structure to respond domestically and internationally to the emerging issue was set up by the PMO, was initially proposed to expand and include officials from key ministries like finance, policy circles are keen to see if the critics of the minister, such as Prodipto Ghosh and Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, will be shunted out in the process.The PMO has not shown willingness to move on the issue despite different groups pushing for a radical change in the core team, which includes serving and retired government officials. But the minister's continued strained relations with the negotiators and the `retirement' of the PM's special envoy has, after they were first voiced before the Copenhagen meet in 2008, again raised head -- is the PM, the minister and the Congress party on the same page when it comes to altering stance at the climate talks.While the issue may not influence immediate domestic politics, the party is seen to understand the link of the negotiations to the future prices of electricity -- an aam admi concern.Reacting to the latest controversy over Ramesh's bid to discount the per-capita principle, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said, "Providing commercial energy to 550 million Indians identified in the Integrated Energy Policy as well as fuelling an economy that is expected to grow at 8-10% over the next decades must be juxtaposed against the need to preserve planet Earth. That minimalist imperative may be doctrinal."While the PM has underlined the same concerns in several public speeches, his action or inaction on several ocassions has sent out conflicting signals. Ramesh on his own part has always claimed that he had won the flexibility mandate from not only the PM, but the Cabinet and Parliament too. The Cabinet in December last cleared the note for negotiations that had held on to most of the critical red lines though the minister had come back from the Copenhagen talks suggesting that he had stepped away from the Cabinet clearance on just one issue but only with the blessing of the PM who was present towards the end of the contentious meet at the Danish capital.Shyam Saran, sources told TOI, too had found it difficult to gauge the mood in the PMO on the prickly issue and found himself wedged between the minister in charge taking a clear radically new line and the top not providing a decisive brief for him to pursue.

Last week, the PM's special envoy on climate , Shyam Saran, bid adieu to his charge, apparently miffed over seniority issues. Now, another top negotiator, Chandrashekar Dasgupta, has quit as well. It's no secret that Saran and other negotiators, including Dasgupta, held differing views from that of environment minister Jairam Ramesh on India's negotiating position. These exits must be viewed in the context of the minister suggesting that India was willing to revisit its stance on per capita emissions What seems to have caused turbulence is that Ramesh has outsourced a study on a matter of such crucial national interest to Washington think-tanker Arvind Subramanium, who advocates junking the per capita emissions principle. Ramesh has also called a meeting of international experts and wants to consider whether India should redefine its long-standing negotiating stance, that the world share the burden of climate change by factoring in per capita emissions of all countries. Simply put, it means that developed countries, which have very high per capita emissions and are the world's leading polluters, take an equivalent proportion of action to combat climate change. And developing countries like India, while committing to grow responsibly, are not asked to make the same kind of cuts as developed countries. This is what is referred to as the 'equity principle' and it is enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol.This is a just principle. Developing countries cannot be measured on the same scale as advanced countries, which have already reaped the benefits of rapid and widespread industrialisation. The US has tried to push for the abandonment of the equity principle for a while now. It also insists on setting a common baseline year for all countries from which they would have to count and cap carbon emissions. Of course, the US and other leading western powers refuse to make any substantial cuts of their own and are seeking to shape the debate to their advantage.India is a responsible power and is committed to tackling climate change, but it also is entitled to grow and fulfil the aspirations of its people. Abandoning, or diluting, the equity principle is not in our interests. We hope the minister will not act in haste and will adopt a more consultative approach while articulating India's position on a matter of national significance.

a((VConcerned that India might abandon its per capita stance in the debate on equity in the global carbon space, key members of the Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change have sought a debate in Parliament before taking any decision.\u000a\u000aIndications that this core position might change have come from statements made by Environment Minister Speaking to the media at the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit on February 7, Ramesh had said: \u201cPer capita is one option.\u201d He also had said that economist Arvind Subramanian had been commissioned to undertake a study on the various options available.\u000a\u000aThe study, he said, would be completed by the end of April. And it would take into account the work of other economists such as Jeffrey Sachs, Michael Spence and Jeffrey Frankel. Ramesh had then said India would host an international workshop in May to discuss other options and come up with a formula to ensure fair burden-sharing in the reduction of future greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aThe fact that India has roped in US academics for the study has itself raised concerns. Views of some of these economists are known to favour the industrialised world as they call for binding emission cuts from countries like China and India.\u000a\u000aOne of India\u2019s lead negotiators at Copenhagen and member of the PM\u2019s council on climate change, C Dasgupta, said he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d at some moves to question the basic principles of the negotiations. \u201cThe per capita approach is about equity. It implies that every inhabitant of this planet has an equal right. Every average Indian has an equal right,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe sudden departure of the Prime Minister\u2019s special envoy on climate change, Shyam Saran, has deepened apprehensions that India\u2019s core position is about to change. Saran had expressed his misgivings earlier to Prime Minister on the direction Ramesh was taking. Per capita, so far, has formed the core of the Indian stance on climate change, with Singh himself stressing this position at several international forums.\u000a\u000aDasgupta said if there was a departure from the basic policy stand, he would have little interest in continuing with his role in climate change discussions. \u201cWhy should there be an international conference to discuss anational agenda?\u201d he questioned.\u000a\u000aAnother lead negotiator, Prodipto Ghosh, agreed: \u201cThese are issues that should be publicly debated.\u201d The issue was to be considered at the level of policy and not personalities, he said, referring to Saran\u2019s resignation.\u000a\u000aDasgupta also said individuals and personalities were inconsequential. The concern was about the main issue and the undermining of the policy. \u201cClimate change policy cannot be the responsibility of one department. Consequences of any such decision would be borne by Indian people.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo far, India\u2019s stand has been that while it may have the fifth-largest annual emissions in the world in gross terms, when divided by the huge population and considered in per capita terms, it falls to the 120th ranking. India has promised to never exceed the per capita emission figures of the developed countries, while reserving the right to increase gross emissions as the economy grows.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister has made per capita convergence (of the developed and developing world) the Indian climate change policy\u2019s underlying principle, saying, while India\u2019s emissions would grow, they would never cross the per capita levels of the rich world.\u000a\u000aPredictably, there is pressure to change this core position. And any such change would be to the detriment of India\u2019s poor, say experts. However, indications are that this stance may change. \u201cThose who have contributed most to the stock (industrialised nations) are not those who will contribute most to the flow... that is, India, China, Brazil, South Africa,\u201d Ramesh pointed out at the summit. India plans to have its formula ready before the next UN climate change negotiations in May at Bonn.

a((VIt is only in the last quarter century that mankind has begun to grapple with the fact that the earth’s atmosphere is not a limitless resource. This stark reality has been brought home to us by climate change. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, mankind has been burning ever increasing quantities of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) and the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the principal cause of global warming. Scientists tell us that if the progressive concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is allowed to exceed a certain range, it will lead to dangerous interference with the climate system. In other words, the planet’s atmosphere must be treated as a scarce resource. The current negotiations on climate change seek to limit greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and thus, in effect, regulate access to the global atmospheric resource. Since fossil fuels are the main source of carbon dioxide emissions, a climate change agreement has major implications for the levels and patterns of energy consumption available to signatory countries. For a developing country like India, it is essential that any agreement should be based on equity, that it should not slow down economic and social development and poverty eradication or perpetuate the vast economic divide between the developed and developing countries. The vast bulk of the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has originated in the industrialized countries as a result of their very high levels of consumption of coal, oil and gas. These countries are thus occupying much more than their fair share of atmospheric space. In order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, the developed countries must reduce their per capita emissions, releasing adequate atmospheric space for the development of poorer countries. India has always maintained the principled position that every human being has an equal right to the global atmospheric resource. Per capita emissions of developing countries are a small fraction of those of the industrialized countries. For example, India’s per capita emission is just a little over one tonne of CO2e, compared to more than 19 tonnes CO2 of the United States of America. Per capita emissions of poorer countries will rise as their energy consumption increases to meet the requirements of economic and social development and poverty eradication. As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change notes, “The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.” Equity demands that, over a period of time, the declining per capita emissions of the developed countries should converge with the rising per capita emissions of the developing countries, while compensating the latter for the excess atmospheric space previously occupied by the developed countries. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change requires the affluent industrialized countries to cover the incremental costs of mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries. The international community should combat climate change on the basis of equity. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has proposed that India’s per capita emissions will not, at any stage, exceed those of the developed countries. This is not only a fair but even a generous offer. It is no more than an assertion of our right to utilize an equal measure of energy on a per capita basis as the developed countries, provided we adopt the same energy mix and technology as the advanced countries. Perpetuating the vast disparity between the per capita emissions of the advanced and the developing countries would amount to perpetuating the huge differences in their per capita income levels. A climate change treaty that binds us to lower per capita emissions over the long term will also restrict our per capita use of coal, oil and natural gas to lower levels than those of developed countries, making it virtually impossible for us to close the income gap with those countries. Any climate change agreement that denies us our right to equal utilization of the global atmospheric resource would be an unequal treaty restricting our right to development. It would divide the world into two categories of countries: those who are rich and those who are poorer — and treaty-bound to remain poorer. Not surprisingly, the principle of equity based on an equal per capita approach has served as the basic foundation of our position in the climate change negotiations, ever since they began in 1990. Every government in New Delhi has endorsed this approach, reflecting a national consensus cutting across party lines. This consensus has now been challenged by the minister of state for environment, Jairam Ramesh. Earlier this month, major national newspapers carried the startling report that the minister of state had indicated that India may abandon the per capita approach. The minister added that the US-based economist, Arvind Subramanian, has been commissioned to prepare a paper on alternative options. This is not the place to critique Subramanian’s writing on climate change; suffice it to say that he rejects the per capita equity approach. Jairam Ramesh also revealed that he plans to hold an international workshop in May, so that a new approach is ready before the climate change negotiations scheduled for June. Rejecting the per capita principle would undermine the position of India and other developing countries on the question of climate equity. By proposing to “decapitate” the principle of equity, the minister has already inflicted severe damage to our credibility in the negotiations. Ramesh’s statement gives rise to a number of questions. First, did the minister of state consult the cabinet before questioning in public the basic foundation of our long-standing national policy? After all, the per capita approach has been regularly endorsed by cabinet decisions over the past two decades. Second, does the minister of state plan to consult Parliament and, if so, when? Should a policy resting on a national consensus be reversed without reference to Parliament? Third, does Ramesh propose to consult India’s civil society and the Indian public? Would a national workshop not have been a more appropriate forum to debate a possible reversal of India’s policy than an international gathering? These disturbing questions require immediate answers. Our policy on a vitally important issue like climate change must rest on a national consensus. It cannot be arbitrarily refashioned on a personal whim. A major policy reversal, such as the approach contemplated by the minister of state for environment, should be taken only if it is approved by Parliament.

It was only 1.7 per cent, says the study.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the allocation in the 2009-10 budget was 2.68 per cent, it says.\u000a\u000aIn real money terms, this percentage figure still works out to a sizable Rs.1.56 lakh crore, including 146 government schemes from 22 ministries, covering all the sectors identified in the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC).\u000a\u000aHowever, the study points out that if this figure is broken up, a large portion of the expenditure is allocated to programmes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) which are focussed on general poverty alleviation.\u000a\u000aThere is no clear linkage to the NAPCC\u2019s policy statements focussing on sustainability of ecosystem services or any indication of how poverty alleviation could be integrated into the overall adaptation framework, says Yamini Mishra, executive director of CBGA.\u000a\u000aShe adds that it is not clear if the NAPCC missions will subsume existing measures such as NREGS or whether additional measures will be supported by additional budgetary allocations. In light of this, a separate fund, under the oversight of the Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change, can help provide and oversee additional resources meant specifically for adaptation, the study says.

Ganesan\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aFrom the Copenhagen talks on climate change to the Afghan intervention and the moral dilemma in using drones to drive out the Taliban, British High Commissioner to India Richard Stagg fielded questions on a range of topics on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAnd the students of the Asian College of Journalism (ACJ) who participated in the informal interaction on the college premises obtained a first-hand experience of seasoned diplomatic talk as he presented the complexities in the different cases.\u000a\u000aCopenhagen talks\u000a\u000aStating his disappointment with the outcome of the Copenhagen talks, Mr. Stagg said the United Kingdom and other countries that were ambitious about getting clearer outcomes had not been able to make themselves heard at the conference.\u000a\u000aA consensus should be evolved taking in mind the larger global picture, he said. He suggested that bringing \u201c15,000 people to a city\u201d to discuss the issue might not work.\u000a\u000aIndia had to look at an alternative model of growth to avoid problems the developed world was facing due to industrialisation. The problem of unemployment could be solved only by developing the manufacturing sector and this had to be done in such a way as to minimise risks of climate change.\u000a\u000aAfghan issue\u000a\u000aOn the Afghan question, Mr. Stagg said the collateral damage caused by the efforts against the Taliban presented a moral dilemma as there was always the danger the Taliban might destroy a whole village if left free. The long-term solution to the problem would be to make civil society and the civilian administration and governance systems stronger.\u000a\u000aEarlier, initiating the interaction, Mr. Stagg said the media was a key protector of freedoms and could be an engine of social change by bringing little known issues into the public consciousness.\u000a\u000a\u2018Paid news\u2019\u000a\u000aAt the same time, it was important to understand current issues including the phenomenon of \u201cpaid news\u201d and the recognition of boundaries separating the rights to privacy of individuals and the rights of the public to know.\u000a\u000aIndia and the United Kingdom had a shared cultural history and the media had been a key link between the two countries, he said. He called for greater ties in education and suggested more British students use the excellent facilities available in India.\u000a\u000aThe agreement signed between ACJ and the Cardiff University to provide students an opportunity to get M.A. degrees by completing a few more credit requirements after finishing their ACJ diploma course was a step in the right direction, he said.

The odds are tremendous against anyone trying to do anything right and rational when it comes to the environment and forests,\u201d he said, using the words \u2018thankless\u2019 and \u2018friendless\u2019 to describe his job.\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh has come under fire for a number of issues during his nine-month tenure. Most recently, his controversial decision to slap a moratorium on Bt brinjal, and speculation that his differences with the Prime Minister\u2019s special envoy for climate change, Shyam Saran, caused the latter to quit.\u000a\u000aMinistry of \u2018No\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you take this job seriously, controversy is bound to follow you.

However, he made it clear that he would take responsibility for climate change policies, not Mr. Saran, as he was the one answerable to Parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is my job to set the policy. Bureaucracy cannot dictate policies. We consult them, they are partners,\u201d Mr. Ramesh said, adding, \u201cI am not a rubber stamp for the bureaucracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe is, however, nominating the senior-most bureaucrat from his Ministry to take over the top spot at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Environment Secretary Vijai Sharma\u2019s name has been proposed, and while China has already expressed formal support, the other BASIC countries are expected to follow suit.\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh urged the revival of the National Advisory Council (NAC), which he called \u201cthe conscience of UPA I\u201d from which all the flagship schemes of the government emanated.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a crying need to revive NAC II, with similar leadership,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe Minister has no intention of shying away from controversy.

I had nothing to do with his (Saran's) decision (to quit)".Saran quit last week amid reports that his serious differences with Ramesh on the approach to climate change negotiations was a key factor behind the decision.The minister said suggestions that he was on a different page than the Prime Minister on climate change was "absolutely bunkum".Calling his job as environment minister to be "thankless and friendless", Ramesh said he has no friends in the cabinet and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is his only supporter."I have no friends, it's only the prime minister in the cabinet (who backs me). I believe the job of environment minister has to be a friendless and thankless job," Ramesh said.Ramesh said that it is the nature of his job if you take it seriously, controversy is bound to surround you.He said that sometimes he felt like he was "fighting a lost battle" and that within Indian politics few took a stand on environment and forest concerns apart from the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Sonia Gandhi."If you are serious about your job here, then you are bound to displease somebody or the other."Probably one of the reasons that I am in the midst of controversy is because I am taking the decision, not lobbying the decision. I was opposed by civil aviation minister when I raised a whole lot of questions on the Mumbai international airport which is going to destroy 400 acres of Mangrove forests and divert two rivers. I was opposed by agriculture ministry on Bt Brinjal and opposition from scientists when I said no to the Neutrino Observatory in the Nilgiris," he said.

It all happened at the Brightest Young Climate Leaders (BYCL) Summit held at the British Council.\u000a\u000aThe two-day meet, organised by Arctic Holdings in partnership with Hindustan Times and British Council, is focused\u000a\u000aon recognising the best proposition on reducing carbon\u000a\u000afootprint.\u000a\u000aThe winning idea \u2014 to be judged on Thursday \u2014 will be implemented with the help of Arctic Holding, a carbon management company.\u000a\u000aBut before they got down to brainstorming, the 50 climate warriors were in for a heady dose of inspiration courtesy Actor Rahul Bose. His advice on converting climate offenders: Create an emotional tug.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose 200-odd leaders fail to reach a consensus in Copenhagen because they think that agreeing to any drastic change would make them lose elections back home. It\u2019s your job to create civil society pressure which in turn would propel politicians into action,\u201d Bose said.\u000a\u000aWhile Bose showed ways of convincing others to join the climate movement, Dario-Andri Schwörer, a well-known environment activist from Switzerland, was a strong example of how one should emulate a green life first to inspire others.\u000a\u000aA member of the core expedition team of Top To Top (an NGO of climate change volunteers) Schwörer along with his family is on a mission to cover seven seas and seven summits only with the help of renewable energy.\u000a\u000aOn their way to the final destination, the Schwörer family visits schools and universities in different countries to spread the message of environment conservation.\u000a\u000aTill now they have covered over 40 countries only by walking, push biking and sailing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were quite spellbound by Dario\u2019s way of life.

a((VNEW DELHI: Differences over India's climate negotiations that contributed to Prime Minister's special envoy Shyam Saran opting out of PMO seem to centre on differing appreciations of what constitutes the "quid pro quo" for India to consider altering its stance on binding commitments.As chief negotiator, Saran was clear that in the absence of any preparedness on part of the developed world to support technology transfer and adaptation or a meaningful fiscal plan India could not dilute its opposition to legally binding emission cuts. A global deal could not retard India's growth but had to be an "additionality" that helped it grow.The former foreign secretary saw himself working within the confines of a brief approved by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the cabinet. Any conditionality that slows growth was simply not acceptable politically as it would hurt not the upper crust of India but those who are economically and socially most at risk.While India had not crossed any red line at Copenhagen, the post-summit pressure of developed nations to further blur existing legal commitments while nudging countries like India to accept cuts was bound to increase. Beyond a point, negotiations could not be "popularity contests" and India would have to mark out its territory.While Saran's discomfort with environment minister Jairam Ramesh 's "flexibility" mantra was evident, the decision to move on was his own. Saran conveyed this to the Prime Minister who suggested he reconsider. There would be no "embarrassment" over Shiv Shankar Menon becoming national security adviser. Saran would be elevated to MoS rank. Saran explained he felt it was time to get on. "One should know when to walk away," said sources.India's climate negotiations in the next few years would be crucial in terms of wider implications for the economy. Developed nations, reeling under an economic slowdown and viewing emerging economies as likely rivals, were not willing to pass up sale of new technology. They felt nations like China and India could now pay for these while trying to wriggle out of what was agreed at Kyoto and earlier at Rio de Janeiro.With Ramesh having accepted his differences with Saran and stressing the "final say" of the political executive, a replacement for the special envoy is not expected. With the climate negotiating team being recast, it needed to be seen whether it will move to the environment ministry from the PMO. So far, the negotiating team had adopted an intensely debated, but collaborative approach.Ahead of the Copenhagen summit, aware that the meet is part of a process that will settle a new global pecking order, the Indian team had worked to ensure it would not be seen as a hold-out. Formal submissions were made with those on technology innovations being accepted. While India was at risk as a tropical nation and also needed to do its bit, it had to be clear about what was being offered in return for a global binding deal.After three-and-a-half years as special envoy, Saran can look back on a job well done after being initially brought in for the India-US nuclear deal. While at PMO, he also handled the solar mission and infrastructure development along the China border.There was no "offer" to handle ties with China -- former NSA M K Narayanan's charge -- but during his tenure Saran had been more than prepared to deal with whatever came his way. His expertise with Nepal, China and Pakistan were obvious plusses.

Indranil Bhoumik/Mint Currently, anyone who exploits forest land for commercial purposes must pay a compensatory amount to the Centre, whose permission is required for felling trees, which in turn devolves money to the states. Over the next few years, states will be rewarded, and not merely compensated, for the density of their forest cover, said the report.\u000a\u000aFor improving forest cover, the body has recommended Rs5,000 crore as forest grant, and expects the states to put in place systems for afforestation in the next two years.\u000a\u000aStates aren\u2019t expected to start lobbying for incentives immediately. Over 75% of the kitty, nearly Rs3,250 crore, is expected to be disbursed over two years to help states set up institutional mechanisms to preserve their forest wealth.\u000a\u000aIn sync with the aim of managing environment and climate change, the commission has recommended an incentive grant of Rs5,000 crore for grid-connected renewable energy to the states, based on the renewable energy capacity addition in the period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2014. Of India\u2019s total installed capacity of 156,783.98MW, renewable energy contributes only around 10%, or 15,427.10MW.\u000a\u000aWatch videos, play the budget game, and find out how the budget affects you. All that and more on Livemint.com\u2019s exclusive Budget 2010 microsite\u000a\u000aEnergy conservation apart, the commission has recommended Rs5,000 crore as a water sector management grant to be disbursed among states, with a caveat that they set up regulatory authorities that will fix and regulate a tariff system and charge for surface and groundwater usage for domestic, agriculture and industrial purposes. This will encourage states to charge consumers commensurate with their usage.\u000a\u000aEmphasizing that establishing innovative systems of governance were key to implementing these wide-ranging reforms at the state level, the commission has recommended a Centre for Innovations in Public Systems at Hyderabad, which will actively promote and disseminate practices that have enhanced service delivery, increased efficiency and reduced costs in public systems. It has proposed a Rs1 crore fund for each district to facilitate the initiative.

The Eleventh Five-Year Plan includes an indicative target of increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent by 2016-17,\u201d the Survey, tabled in Parliament, said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Planning Commission\u2019s estimates, emission intensity declined by 17.6 per cent between 1990 and 2005, and a further 20-25 per cent reduction is possible from 2005 to 2020, it added.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will require that necessary actions in specific sectors are undertaken to reduce emission intensity with necessary provisions of financial and technological resources, including domestic and international support, for achieving low-carbon sustainable development,\u201d the Survey noted.\u000a\u000aHowever, despite various possible measures, the country\u2019s carbon emission level will increase gradually.\u000a\u000a\u201cIts (India\u2019s) climate modelling studies show that its per capita emissions will be around 2-2.5 tonnes of carbon- dioxide equivalent by 2020 and around 3-3.5 tonnes of carbon- dioxide equivalent by 2030, compared to around 1-1.2 tonnes presently,\u201d the Survey said.\u000a\u000aThe pre-Budget survey pointed out that India contributes about 4 per cent of the total global CO2 emissions and the country has conveyed that per capita emission levels would never exceed the average levels of developed countries.\u000a\u000aThe world leaders met at Copenhagen in December 2009 to discuss and reach at an outcome on climate change issues.\u000a\u000aHowever, the conference ended without adopting any result from the discussions, but only took note of \u2018Copenhagen Accord\u2019. It was decided to carry forward the negotiations in Mexico from November 29 to December 10, 2010.\u000a\u000aThe Survey said that despite commitments made by developed countries as inscribed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, emissions from most of the three dozen-odd industrialised nations of Annex 1, except a few European countries, have been rising since 1990.\u000a\u000aIn order to reduce carbon emissions from India, the government currently spends over 2.6 per cent of the GDP on adaptation to climate variability, with specific areas of concern in agriculture, water resources, forests, health and sanitation, coastal zone infrastructure and extreme events.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia has prepared a comprehensive National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) with a view to achieving sustainable development with co-benefit in terms of climate change,\u201d it said, adding eight national missions on various fields, including solar energy, sustainable agriculture, Himalayan eco-system and strategic knowledge for climate change form the core of the action plan.

a((VRailway minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday proposed a number of measures to fulfil the common and collective responsibility to take care of mother earth. These include introducing at least 10 rakes with green toilets, installing GPS-based optimised driver guidance systems on diesel locomotives to enhance fuel efficiency and developing as many as 10 Rail Eco-parks this year.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to journalists at the Rail Bhawan, Banerjee said, This is our small endeavour in this direction. She added that in future the ministry would like to invest more in clean technologies.\u000a\u000aThe railway minister said in her budget speech that installing GPS-based driver guidance systems would reduce fuel consumption by up to 10%. Indian Railways spent Rs14,884.68 crore on fuels including diesel in 2009, and has budgeted for Rs 15,778.12 crore towards "operating expenses-fuel" in the current budget year.\u000a\u000aBanerjee also proposed setting up at least 10 eco parks to "conserve, protect and promote Railways' wetlands" this year, including the recently inaugurated Rail Eco-park at Naopara. She also said the ministry would work closely with the Prime Minister's National Action Plan on Climate Change and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency.\u000a\u000aSaying that Railways has always been environment-friendly, Banerjee recounted steps that the ministry has already taken in this direction, such as distributing 26 lakh units of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs).\u000a\u000a"If we take a ballpark figure, and assuming that the CFLs are 25 watts each, the savings in terms of power could amount to one-fourth of what it takes to light as many 100-watt bulbs," said Gaurav Shorey, area convenor, Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment, The Energy Research Institute.\u000a\u000aShorey warned, however, that if the CFLs are less than 15 watts, the scheme could backfire because the light generated from these bulbs would not be enough for everyday needs.\u000a\u000aThe budget speech, while promising in terms of the kinds of green initiatives announced, did not provide details on the mechanics of how these would be implemented--such as the location of the other nine eco parks--and the outlay.

The U.S. was party to that decision.\u000a\u000aHowever, in its submission to the U.N. last week, the U.S. claims that \u201cit was not agreed that the LCA texts would be the basis of any future negotiation.\u201d Instead, it wants the Copenhagen Accord, a political agreement which was not even adopted at the summit, to be the basis of future negotiations.\u000a\u000aIndian negotiators say the submissions by various countries to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change outline the key battle lines being drawn as the talks resume in April.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. attempt to sneak in the word \u201cscrutiny\u201d (to describe international monitoring of voluntary attempts by developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) was thwarted by India, as The Hindu reported on Sunday. However, the U.S. view of which text will form the basis of future negotiations could cause India more worry.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. submission says: \u201cThe Copenhagen Accord achieves a number of landmark outcomes that\u2026provide a basis for an agreed outcome in Mexico,\u201d where the next major summit will be held in December 2010. It downplays the texts developed by the LCA working group over two years of multilateral talks, saying: \u201cSignificantly, it was not agreed that the LCA texts would be the basis of any future negotiation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis has no relation to reality, according to senior Indian negotiator Prodipto Ghosh. \u201cThe formal COP [conference of the parties] decision at Copenhagen extended the mandate of the LCA working group to enable it to present its outcome for adoption at Mexico,\u201d he points out. \u201cTherefore, it is not correct to say that. The COP did agree to the LCA texts.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo what about the Copenhagen Accord, on which the U.S. wants future talks to be based? \u201cIt was not even adopted by the conference. It was only taken note of,\u201d said Shyam Saran, the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy on Climate Change, while addressing the European Business Group last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a political document with valuable content because it represents a broad consensus at a very high level. It is a valuable input, but it must go into the multilateral negotiation process now. Otherwise, it has no legitimacy or operationalisation,\u201d he said, echoing what India\u2019s submission to the U.N. said. Most developing countries, including China and Brazil, agreed strongly with that view.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will be a major dispute once we sit down for negotiations again,\u201d says Mr. Ghosh. As countries begin down the road to Mexico, the most basic issues are at stake once again.

This has been done keeping in mind the operationalisation of the ambitious Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission that targets production of 20,000 MW of solar power by 2022.\u000a\u000aMukherjee also announced a slew of tax incentives for machinery and equipment used in the production of solar or wind energy,as also for the innovative solar-powered rickshaw developed by the CSIR.\u000a\u000aTo address energy deficiency in Ladakh,the Finance Minister proposed to set up solar,small hydro and micro power projects at the cost of Rs 500 crore in the area.\u000a\u000a“For the first time,the government has placed real focus on the renewable energy sector,this is a major step forward in balancing the nation’s energy mix and creates a sound environment for the growth of renewable sector in the country,” said Tulsi Tanti,CMD of Suzlon Energy.\u000a\u000aIn other green initiatives,the Finance Minister announced setting up of ‘Mission Clean Ganga 2020’ under the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the objective that no untreated municipal sewage or industrial effluent will be discharged into the national river.

a((VNEW DELHI: The controversy over the IPCC observations on melting of Himalayan glaciers by 2035 took a new turn with glaciologist Syed Hasnain contending that he has never mentioned the time in his research papers which the UN body had included in its climate change report.He also said that he was not even consulted by the IPCC for including his research papers in the report."I am unnecessarily being dragged into the controversy. The IPCC did not even consult me or ask me for my research papers for inclusion in the fourth assessment report," Hasnain, a Fellow with The Energy and Resources Institute, said.The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), headed by Rajendra K Pachauri , has triggered a controversy with claims that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 due to global warming.The Indian government had questioned the finding last year and come out with its own report doubting the glacier melt at the pace the IPCC had predicted.The IPCC findings were based on Hasnain's interview to "New Scientist" magazine in 1999 which were used by Murari Lal who had edited the chapter on glaciers for the IPCC report.Lal claimed Hasnain had "misled" the entire scientific community by making the claims and IPCC had relied on his remarks made in the interview "in good faith"."I do not understand why they picked only the interview I had given to New Scientist. I have not mentioned the year 2035 in any of the research papers written by me," Hasnain said.

a((VDAVOS: Climate change cannot be tackled in isolation from food security, energy security, and poverty alleviation, Anand Sharma, commerce minister, told international investors at Davos on Friday.While the outcome of Copenhagen was disappointing, Sharma used the occasion for a private meeting to international investors to explain India's stance of "shared but differential responsibilities". "You cannot perpetuate poverty," he told them, on a day when the Davos summit moved into its more social mood, with climate change, food security, water, and issues like ethics dominating the sessions.Closer home, Sharma, who will meet up for a mini-ministerial with his counterparts to discuss WTO and Doha, said that it has become even more imperative to remove international trade barriers, in order to stimulate a quicker and stronger economic recovery.The day's big development was that Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced a massive $10 billion for developing and delivering vaccines, in an aim to increase immunization coverage in developing countries to 90%, which would prevent the deaths of 7.6 million children under five by 2019.Elsewhere news that the US economy has made a sharp comeback, with a 5.6% 4th quarter rate, brought smiles to rather gloomy faces, since the consensus view from talking heads and analysts is that the global recovery is likely to be weak and slow. But as Sharma pointed out, while considering the risk of sovereign defaults which has been looming over countries like Greece, America is still the largest economy.While details were not available at the time of going to press, this bit of news would clearly bring a bounce to the long string of late night parties that are traditional on a Friday night at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting at Davos.

a((VNEW DELHI: The furore over the validity of data used by UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has taken some of the sheen off the Nobel prize-winning institution's reputation.A day after it emerged that IPCC's dire prediction that climate change would melt most Himalyan glaciers by 2035 was based on mere "speculation", environment minister Jairam Ramesh slammed the processes of the celebrated body saying "due diligence had not been followed by the Nobel peace prize winning body"."The health of glaciers is a cause of grave concern but the IPCC's alarmist position that they would melt by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence," the environment minister said.Ramesh recalled how IPCC chief R K Pachauri had scornfully dismissed doubts raised by a government agency about the veracity of the UN body's sensational projection about melting of glaciers. "In fact, we had issued a report by scientist V K Raina that the glaciers have not retreated abnormally. At the time, we were dismissed, saying it was based on voodoo science. But the new report has clearly vindicated our position," he said.This may not be the first time that climate science relating to India has been found to be fallacious or incorrect. However, revelation that the data on glacial melt in Himalayas was unverified has dented the image of the IPCC -- which has set the agenda for climate change talks. It has given a handle to climate sceptics who have long accused the IPCC of being biased.The report by Raina and other glaciologists had found support from some well-known glaciologists from across the world at that time.Pachauri, the high profile head of IPCC, acknowledged to TOI that the controversy had caused loss of face for the institution. "Of course, it goes without saying (that the IPCC's reputation has suffered). We have to see that its gold-plated standard is maintained," he said.The embarrassment comes close on the heels of the disclosure of emails among scientists aligned with the IPCC who argued that data undercutting their conclusions should be withheld from public.When asked what steps the IPCC would take to correct the erroneous information in its report, Pachauri said the group would move swiftly to verify facts at its own level, work to figure how the `deviation from due process occurred' and act on the situation.Other sources, not willing to come on record, suggested that IPCC was looking at the possibility of a `corrigendum or errata' to be published within the week. While this is not unprecedented in IPCC history, corrections carried out so far related to typographical errors.This time, however, the body will be correcting an unverified report that not only got included in its findings that framed the cliamte change negotitations but remained undetected for more than two years.The IPCC is only meant to include peer-reviewed information that has passed the litmus test of being published in reputed journals. But this is not the first time that data on India, often used by industrialised countries to put pressure on Delhi to take actions, has been found to be incorrect."In 1990, US raised a scare that methane emissions (an intense greenhouse gas) from wet paddy fields in India were as high as 38 million tonnes. It was later found by Indian scientists and globally accepted that it was as low as 2-6 million tonnes," Ramesh said.Again in 2000, just before crucial negotiations, US and other industrialised countries flogged an unverified report of UNEP that claimed soot from chullahs (earthen cookstoves) was adding greatly to climate change, calling it the Asian Brown Haze.

Jon Price, Director of the Centre talks to Tirna RayIt was a necessity that evolved out of a need for collaborative academic research working alongside business to develop low carbon technologies in an academic institutional setting. A joint initiative of the Regional Development Authority (Yorkshire Forward) and the region\u2019s universities, the centre will address the questions posed in developing a low carbon future from two complementary perspectives \u2014 life-cycle carbon management and climate change impacts and adaptation.The £50 million UK-based research centre will harness the research power of leading universities both to develop clean technologies and help in the reduction of carbon emissions. The centre sets out to provide a practical solution, providing assistance to regional and international business with the practical application of new technologies into usable products. Clearly, climate change is not just about low carbon technologies, it\u2019s also about a change in behaviour \u2014 the way we live in a low carbon society.The centre has already identified the first four pilot research projects covering the regional economics of climate change, low carbon supply chains, bio-renewables and carbon capture technology.It is a multi-disciplined institution, drawing on the social sciences, natural sciences, engineering and economics, which harnesses the firepower from four leading universities of Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York along with many other higher education institutions in the region. For academics, the centre provides the opportunity to be involved in multi-disciplinary, translational research and training activities with new collaborators from academic, policy and commercial organisations, which will shape the development of a low carbon future within the region and beyond.Also, it will offer scholars and academicians a chance to make an impact with low carbon solutions in society. Meanwhile, the centre can leverage funds from regional, national, European government and research councils. The centre is creating teams of natural scientists, engineers and social scientists, working across traditional boundaries, in a research centre developed in close liaison with private and public sector stakeholders.It will draw on the expertise of world-class researchers in the region as a focal point for understanding and demonstrating how business can evolve and adapt in a low-carbon world. In fact, by conducting \u2018translational\u2019 research into clean technologies, the centre will be a conduit for the practical application of low carbon technologies, helping both to attract inward investment and enhance business growth and economic output.

a((VFrom what N Anil Kumar, 46, an ocean scientist with the Goa-based National Centre for Antarctic & Ocean Research (NCAOR) packs into his bag, his sons know whether or not to ask him to take them along. When their dad is stuffing polar clothing into the backpack it means he will be away for a few months, usually in Antarctica , where the temperature dips to minus 89 degrees Celsius. As Kumar and his team of 19 scientists leave for the Southern Ocean - the first such expedition after the Copenhagen meet - the world will be eagerly awaiting new scientific evidence on global warming and its impact. The Southern Ocean, that extends between 35° and 60° south latitudes circling the Antarctic region, is an area that scientists the world over believe is vastly unexplored and pregnant with indications of not just the present and future of climate change, but also its past.Ferrying the team of scientists from different research laboratories across the country will be Sagar Nidhi. "It is India's only 'ice' classified vessel fit for a polar expedition. Its five labs can house 30 scientists," says D Rajasekhar, head of the vessel management cell at the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai.This will also be the first time that Indian scientists will be crossing the 55° south latitude to go almost up to the polar region on an Indian vessel. Sagar Nidhi will leave Goa on January 11 for Mauritius and head farther southwards up to 66° south in the Antarctic region."The scientists will take up about 20 studies in the ocean between 35° and 66° south latitudes," says NCAOR director Rasik Ravindra. Prominent among them would be paleoclimatic studies that involve collecting samples from the ocean bed at a depth of up to six kilometres."Sagar Nidhi has equipment that can reach the ocean bed at a depth of up to 6,000 metres and drill seven metres to collect sediments. Changes in sediment formation, water mass and other parameters would be compared with previous data to ascertain the impact of climate change," says Anil Kumar, who leads the team of scientists.NCAOR has been collating data from the region since its first Southern Ocean expedition in 2004. Roughly, the region between 35° and 60° south is considered the Southern Ocean. Beyond it lies the Antarctic. Scientists have to compare data of at least 10 years to see the effect of climate change, and this mid-point expedition is of great importance. Despite expeditions by the US and Japan in the Southern Ocean, and those by India, Australia and South Africa south of the Indian Ocean, the ocean encircling the Antarctic region remains under-explored."The Southern Ocean, defined as the oceanic area south of 35°S, is known to be a very important region in shaping global climate, resulting from active atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions. The ocean is the source for several intermediate and deep water masses of the world. Many aspects of its circulation, water masses and the response of the Southern Ocean to climate change remain unknown primarily due to the lack of high resolution ship observations. This has led to a growing interest in exploration of the region to understand geological, physical, chemical and biological processes and their driving mechanisms operating in this region. The ocean is characterised by large seasonal variability in its environmental conditions, which influence the global climate," says Ravindra.India, now building 'Bharti,' the nation's third permanent research centre in Antarctica, already has a strong presence in the polar region. In spite of the scientific and logistics expertise gained over the years, a wide gap exists in our knowledge of the Southern Ocean, admits the NCAOR director. Another major study the fourth expedition will take up is how organisms adapt to sudden and extreme changes in temperatures. "Between 40° and 41° south latitudes, the ocean temperature drops suddenly from 20° to 9° Celsius. Learning how these organisms adapt to this change will have applications in several fields," adds Kumar.Trying to understand the complex integrated behaviour of the Indian Ocean Sector of the Southern Ocean has been a thrilling experience for scientists. "The scientific results are giving new insights every time we explore," says Ravindra.PLUMBING THE DEPTHSThe men will be carrying cutting-edge equipment to probe deep watersOn Board Sagar NidhiICE class vessel capable of taking up polar explorations Dynamic positioning system helps it stay steady even in strong currents Drop keel allows equipment to be dropped several feet directly below the hull of the vessel Silent ship with no noise interference while doing acoustic testsHIGHT OF THE SHIP 18 mLENGTH OF THE SHIP 103.6 mDRAFT 4.2 mDEAD WEIGHT 1,500 MTFUEL CAPACITY 900 CuMFRESHWATER CAPACITY 350 CuMCOST Rs 232 CrTYPE ICE Class - 1CMANUFACTURER FincantieriSCIENTISTS ONBOARD 20Deep Sea Multi Beam Echo SounderUses multiple beams to measure the vertical depth of the sea up to 10,000 metres by using ultrasound echoElectro Mechanical Cable 25 mm, 8000 mPower-cumdata cable used for coring of seabed and collection of sediments, sand and rocks from the floor for experiments on board the shipShallow Water Single Beam Echo SounderUses the same principle as the deep sea multi beam echo sounder, but uses a single beam to measure the depth of the sea up to 2,000 metresDeep Sea CTD with RosetteThe equipment collects water samples from a depth of up to 6,000 metres, doing away with the need for divers.

a((VIt appears now that the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) grossly exaggerated the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are melting, striking a blow to the credibility of climate change science. In a much-publicised 2007 report, the IPCC had claimed that if current warming trends continued, the glaciers would be gone by 2035. It now transpires that the estimate was based on a 10-year-old interview with one climate scientist and that there is no actual scientific data to back the claim.An Indian governmental report released late last year - rubbished at the time by R K Pachauri, the IPCC head - had in fact suggested that the retreat of Himalayan glaciers had slowed, describing the IPCC estimate as alarmist. The IPCC is the world's premier body for the study of climate change, and its reports are the basis for formulating global policy. This makes its loss of credibility troubling, especially when there's no reason to doubt its overall conclusion that the planet is warming and urgent action is necessary to forestall this.In a similar incident, recent reports revealed the World Health Organisation (WHO) might have overstated the threat posed by the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, tracing links between members of WHO's vaccine board and big pharmaceutical companies. The ties between the members of the board and pharma majors have prompted speculation that the WHO colluded with drug manufacturers to panic governments into buying vaccines. While that may not necessarily be true, at the very least such ties do amount to a significant conflict of interest.While these cases prove that supranational agencies are not without flaws, science itself is not the villain. Most scientists accept that Himalayan glaciers are melting. It is only the degree of the recession that is under dispute. The flawed estimate raises questions about the IPCC's review processes, and there is certainly room for improvement on that front. Whenever scientific studies have massive policy implications, it is necessary for them to be absolutely above board. Any taint of ideological or monetary motivation will render them suspect. For that reason, members of WHO's board need to be transparent about their links with big pharma. Not all science is exact. To retain the public's trust, scientists must be careful to separate hype from fact.

a((VNEW DELHI: For the first time in its history, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) \u2014 a panel of 2,500 of the best climate scientists in the world \u2014 accepted on Wednesday that it had made a huge goof-up in its fourth assessment report on climate change and withdrew its assertion that the Himalayan glaciers ran the risk of being wiped out by 2035.It admitted that proper \u2018\u2018procedures\u2019\u2019 were not followed while reaching the conclusion which not only created a massive scare , particularly in India, but also placed New Delhi often on the backfoot in climate debates leading up to the Copenhagen summit.The Nobel-prize winning body, however, attempted to soften the blow by couching its words. Its statement said: \u2018\u2018It has come to our attention that (the statement on Himalayan glaciers) refers to poorly substantiated estimates of rate of recession and date for the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers. In drafting the paragraph in question, clear and well-established standards of evidence, required by IPCC procedures were not applied properly.\u2019\u2019That non-application of procedure is an euphemism for the boo-boo becomes apparent from the kind of carelessness that went into writing the report.For one, the report is said to have borrowed from a 1996 Russian study by V M Kotlyakov and bungled on the glacier melt deadline predicted by it \u2014 the study set the deadline at 2350, while the IPCC made it 2035, perhaps due to a small typological error, but which in effect advanced the deadline by over 300 years!What\u2019s remarkable is that this deadline was hotly contested by the Indian government. The IPCC team, led by TERI chief R K Pachauri, brushed aside these objections and didn\u2019t even care to double-check its facts, even though the conclusion of its findings meant as dramatic a development as the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers in the next 25 years.IPCC\u2019s lack of rigour also becomes clear from the fact that it shunned peer-reviewed science reports published in well-known journals, and instead lifted references from a report by WWF, an NGO, that supports strong action on climate change. It now transpires that WWF had picked up this alarmist view from a pop-science magazine, the New Scientist.In turn, the magazine had quoted an Indian scientist, Syed Hasnain, then with Jawaharlal Nehru University, but currently working for TERI.

a((V(This piece is a comment) Is a subtle change of climate taking place about the \u2018proven fact\u2019 of man-made climate change? The claims of India\u2019s most visible eco-crusader and proponent of climate change, R K Pachauri, have come under critical scrutiny after it was revealed that the alarms raised about melting glaciers in India could have been based on a literally Himalayan blunder. It seems that our glaciers are not melting after all. Or at least not doing so at an abnormal or disquieting rate.\u000a\u000aThe \u2018prediction\u2019 that the Himalayan glaciers would melt away by 2035 was apparently based on an \u2018approximation\u2019 made by an Indian expert in 1999 which had been \u2018misquoted\u2019 in the New Scientist. As the expert \u2014 whose \u2018expertise\u2019 should be put within the inverted commas of doubt \u2014 never bothered to correct this \u2018misquotation\u2019, the false prophecy became a \u2018factoid\u2019, a fact manufactured by the media and other public agencies.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh has taken to task the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for fobbing off \u2018speculation\u2019 as scientific fact, and thereby doing a grave disservice to the environmental movement as a whole. For the real fact is that humankind \u2014 and in particular the so-called First World \u2014 has done perhaps irreparable harm to the health of our planet through profligate consumption of the Earth\u2019s resources. However, to raise a needless scare about man-made climate change \u2014 which has been elevated to the status of an unquestionable religion \u2014 is to divert attention, and funds, from other more immediate environmental issues to which practical solutions can and must be found. It is as though a patient suffering from fever is told \u2014 on the basis of pure \u2018speculation\u2019 \u2014 that what he has is in \u2018fact\u2019 terminal cancer. The fever \u2014 which could, and should have been treated \u2014 is neglected while various cancer treatments, from surgery to chemotherapy, are endlessly discussed. Eventually the poor patient dies, either because of the neglected fever, or fright, or both. This is the real danger of the false theology of man-made climate change. By making scary claims based on \u2018speculation\u2019 (for which read \u2018unreasoning faith\u2019) instead of provable data, it jeopardises the environmental movement as a whole.\u000a\u000aMan-made climate change is not the only man-made bogey recently raised to frighten us. Reports suggest that WHO \u2018experts\u2019 deliberately created the H1N1 \u2014 or swine flu \u2014 scare at the behest of international pharma companies, who could potentially reap huge profits from selling preventive vaccines or antidotes for the disease.\u000a\u000aWhy are such groundless, or at least exaggerated, fears created? One of the obvious reasons of course is money. When people are frightened they stop thinking critically and are ready to believe in any snake oil salesman who offers a talisman which will exorcise the demon of fear. In the case of climate change, the antidotes on offer include the lucrative trade in carbon credits and an array of supposedly \u2018clean\u2019 technologies and processes that have to be purchased by industries and individuals at substantial cost. That Al Gore, the world\u2019s foremost advocate for climate change, has become a multi-billionaire overnight speaks for itself.\u000a\u000aMoney-making apart, fear is also the most effective tool with which to make people blindly obedient to authority, be it governmental or corporate. Fear can turn thinking human beings into mindless robots, ready to follow orders and instructions, no matter how unreasonable, intrusive or oppressive they may be.\u000a\u000aFear is the secret ally of all dictatorships, and the hidden enemy within all democracies. To ensure safety and survival, all of us need to be alive to dangers, be they in the form of environmental catastrophe, disease or anything else. But let\u2019s try and ensure that our fears are founded on fact, and not on \u2018factoids\u2019. That our fears are real, and not manufactured for us, the better to exploit us with. That is the truly frightful fate.

a((VNEW DELHI: The climate is changing on climate change . And IPCC chief R K Pachauri is feeling the heat. The latest dent to claims that the Himalayan glaciers will melt by 2035 has clearly ruffled the climate man.But while his credibility and that of the IPCC has taken a battering, Pachauri maintains his chutzpah in the face of growing skepticism, arguing that his acceptance that the research on glaciers had been dodgy had actually somehow enhanced the credibility of the body.Speaking to the media on Saturday, Pachauri refused to accept that he needed to quit as chair of IPCC and said he was set to table the fifth report on climate change.He seemed unmindful that gross misreading of the fate of the Himalayan glaciers based on what is now acknowledged to be bad research, has affected the global body more than leaked emails of university researchers saying they had tampered with climate data on which the IPCC report was based.Earlier this week, Pachauri was compelled to acknowledge the scientific error of research on Himalayan glaciers by a TERI fellow, Syed Iqbal Hasnain, after a report by The Sunday Times, London. But on Saturday, Pachauri skated over thin ice, claiming virtue in his admission. The acceptance of the error "only strengthened the credibility" of the global body, he insisted baldly.But the IPCC chief seems to be feeling some unease, particularly as he has even had to recently defend himself against attacks on his own integrity, with the British press accusing him of using his position to help companies he was associated with, pointing to a clear conflict of interest.There was no way TERI or IPCC could penalize Hasnain, he said, or any other author who may have "erred" because they are not employees of IPCC. The fact that IPCC's own due diligence, verification and monitoring mechanisms may need to be questioned too was not acknowledged by the Nobel prize winning body's chief. Instead, Pachauri described the IPCC's processes as "robust and solid".These have already come under question after the leaked emails were made public.Facing a barrage of questions from the media about his `loss of credibility', Pachauri maintained that all ``rational people'' would continue to repose their faith in IPCC and its findings.Pachauri had also faced the heat for dismissing a report by India's senior-most glaciologist V K Raina questioning IPCC's data on Himalayan glaciers melting in 2035 as ``voodoo science''. This time, though, Pachauri maintained a stoic silence on the issue, saying only that the report was not deemed credible because it lacked citations.Last week, the UN panel had expressed regret for erring on the Himalayan glaciers. After the blunder in IPCC's Fourth Assessment report became public, it issued a statement saying that its conclusion was based on ``poorly substantiated estimates of rate of recession and date for the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers".Interestingly, Pachauri also refused to put a date to when the Himalayan glaciers would actually melt.On Sunday, environment ministers of the BASIC countries - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - will be meeting in Delhi to work on their strategy for the 2010 summit.

a((VPATNA: The rain came down suddenly a day before the New Year eve and the cloud continued to overcast the sky even on New Year, with the occasional dull sun peeping out. Met office sources said here that the rainfall was because of a western disturbance and the sky will clear up by Saturday.\u201cIncidentally, the state is witnessing a climatic change for over the last five years. The long cold wave spells are no longer experienced in winter and winters are not that harsh what it used to be,\u201d added met office sources.Even the statistics of the Met department reveals that on January 1, 2009, the minimum and maximum temperature recorded was 8.2 and 23.5 degrees Celsius, while the year 2008 recorded 8.5 and 22 degrees Celsius on January 1 and 2007 also had a minimum of 8.3 and a maximum of 23.8 degrees Celsius on this day.Weathermen even attribute this rise in temperature to global warming.However, as deputy director general meteorology (weather forcasting), IMD, Pune, A B Majumdar said, \u201cVariations in weather conditions are normalphenomenon as it depends on many factors. Nothing can be predicted on the basis of short term data analysis. In fact, not very significant change has come to light in terms of global warming.\u201dBut New Year revellers shrugged off the gloomy damp weather and chill. Partygoers braved the cold weather and celebrated the stroke of midnight.Revellers packed the traditional New Year\u2019s eve haunt and all the posh hotels of the city were booked in advance and people had started trooping in from 7 pm onwards.The day was greeted with pop of champagne corks, bursting of crackers and ringing of church bells. Elsewhere around the city, where planned activities went ahead regardless, with revellers wrapped up in warm clothes to brave the chill and cold winds.Almost all the picnic spots, pubs, clubs all were overcrowded.Many parties were organized even on the banks of the Ganga and Ganga diara where arrangements were made for special food and liquor. Some revellers, braving the cold and chill even spent their night partying on the river bank to see the first sun rise of the New Year.In fact, celebrations had started well in advance on December 31 night with people hurrying home and then proceeding to parties, gathering and outing beating away both the weather and recession blues.Special arrangements were made by the district administarion and police to thwart any untoward incident.

a((VAHMEDABAD: Janardan Negi , a distinguished theoretical geophysicist, has made a controversial forecast that the global warming phase will change to global cooling and the temperature anomaly will decline substantially by the year 2030. Some effects of the process are already evident in the cold wave of 2010 which has brought about widespread snowfall in the northern hemisphere.\u201cLook at the world around us,\u201d Dr Negi, who is now based in Hyderabad, told TOI. Unprecedented cold is sweeping across the globe: Beijing was hit by the heaviest snowfall in the past 40 years. BBC reported that Latvia has recorded lowest temperature of -27 C which is a record low in 100 years. In Russia the lows are the lowest in about 25 years. The Northern Hemisphere shivers with reports from Scotland, Southern England etc being blanketed in the thickest snow since 1981.How can it be so cold despite the warming trend in recent years? The answer, according to Negi, is that there is a very strong global cyclic weather phenomenon which is independent of the greenhouse gas emissions.The cooling of the earth, he said, already started 400 years ago when Europe experienced a mini-ice age. The inter-glacial period is coming to an end. \u201cWarming is a short-term excursion followed by global cooling which shall slowly but surely dominate,\u201d he said.Negi has made these predictions on the basis of \u201cmultiple theoretical analysis of temperature anomaly record\u201d compiled and updated up to September 2000 by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, based in the US. He reached the same conclusion from analysis of magnetic susceptibility record of sediments of the last 3,500 years. The sediments act as earth\u2019s thermometer and Negi says his analysis showed that the earth temperature varied in a cyclic fashion.According to Negi, solar activity and not human activity is contributing to the observed temperature variations. The sunspots also occur in a cyclic fashion with the well-known periodicity of 11 years, 50 years and 180 years. To highlight the link between global temperature and solar activity, Negi says that the number of sunspots fell sharply between 1640 and 1720 around the time the earth experienced a cooling of over 1.2 degrees Celsius.He says mathematical analysis of global temperature variations during 1978-1999 as measured by satellites, and for the period 1880-2000 as obtained from meteorological stations, showed a 70-80 year periodicity. Negi argues that human beings cannot cause or control these cyclic changes that are the result of \u201cthe complex process of solar system variability and atmosphere-sea interaction in different space time scales\u201d. Negi concludes that the global cooling trend is expected to dominate till around 2030.

a((VNEW DELHI: If environment experts had high hopes from Sunday\u2019s meeting of BASIC countries, they were in for disappointment. While the four BASIC nations agreed to the January 31 deadline set by UN for communicating their \u201cvoluntary mitigation actions\u201d, minister Jairam Ramesh skirted all \u2018glacial\u2019 controversies and pledged the collective support of BASIC countries towards the \u201cCopenhagen Accord which is in the nature of a political agreement\u201d and recalled the important contribution of the BASIC countries in its finalisation.Though decisions taken by the BASIC countries have no legal standing in the G77 group, the four members are regarded as the most powerful lobby among the developing nations. In a joint statement released by the BASIC countries, Ramesh said, \u201cThe ministers also maintained their intention to communicate information on their voluntary mitigation actions to the UNFCCC by January 31, 2010.\u201dEarlier in the day, however, PM Manmohan Singh rejected the UN deadline of January 31 for submission of emission targets and climate actions under the Copenhagen Accord. According to sources, the PM was particularly unhappy over the repeated prodding of Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen and UN secretary general Ban ki-Moon to accede to the January 31 deadline for target submission.The PM\u2019s statement assumes significance in the light of remarks made by Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on January 20. Boer had said the January 31 deadline was not binding upon western countries. Only four countries \u2014 Australia, Canada, Papua New Guinea and Maldives \u2014 have signed the Copenhagen Accord while Cuba has rejected it. Ramesh said after the Copenhagen Accord was signed in December 2009, the rich countries were expected to set substantial targets and funds to the tune of $10 billion towards the poor and developing countries.However, this had not been achieved. \u201cIf the promised $10 billion do not flow to Africa, small islands and LDCs, then the developing countries will show that they are not serious in their intent,\u201d Ramesh said.Adding that the BASIC countries had a commitment to fulfil, South African water and environment minister Buyelwa Sonjica said, \u201cWe hope the US will come up and lead the process of climate change. They were lagging behind at Copenhagen. Now, the US has a moral obligation to take the leadership so that we can deliver effectively at Mexico in December 2010.\u201dThe second meeting of ministers of the BASIC group \u2014 Brazil, South Africa, India and China \u2014 concluded on Sunday. On Saturday, Carlos Minc, minister of environment in Brazil, Sonjica, and Xie Zhenhua, environment minister of China had met PM Manmohan Singh. The current chair of G77 Yemen was also invited to the BASIC meeting.

a((VNEW DELHI: The US government sees the Copenhagen Accord as the beginning of a diminished role for the formal UN climate change talks. The chief US negotiator, Jonathan Pershing, was reported stating that US was not confidant of the UN managing the start up finance of US $30 billion the rich countries have offered under the accord."I am not sure that any of us are particularly confident that the UN managing the near-term financing is the right way to go," he was reported saying.His statement made at a think tank meeting came against the backdrop of Cuba taking on the UN Secretary General in very strong words, formally demanding to know what Ban ki-Moon's legal status was to intervene in a biased-fashion in the debate. The UNSG had come under increasing criticism at Copenhagen for reflecting US views on the climate talks and again drawn flack recently for suggesting that each country put its economy-wide targets under the accord, which would turn into a legally binding agreement in future. The BASIC countries, which includes India, had fought hard at the Danish capital to ensure that the contentious accord does not become a legally binding document.While the rich countries have promised in the Copenhagen Accord to mobilize US $30 billion as a start up fund for the most vulnerable countries developing countries have been wary that the funds and other mechanisms could now be managed under less democratic institutions like the G20 (a meeting of which is due in February) or the US-backed Major Economies Forum. Pershing's statement seemed to confirm the apprehensions of the poor countries.India had also agreed to international analysis and consultation on its domestic mitigation actions under the accord. The Copenhagen Accord left it open as to who would determine the guidelines under which such scrutiny would take place. Fears were expressed that with not explicitly mandating that the guidelines would be made under UNFCCC, other forums, tilted in the favour of rich countries could take over the mandate at the cost of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which hosts the Kyoto Protocol too.The BASIC countries had already gone back on their earlier red lines at Copenhagen not insisting that all funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation to poor countries come from public finance and routed through the UN. But Pershing's statements in the US further strengthened the suspicion that the give aways had only begun and not ended at Copenhagen and that India could expect to give in more in the hectic negotiations slated for 2010.

a((VBANGALORE: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has goofed up so badly on its Himalayan glacier melting forecast that it's close to losing credibility among the people. But The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) fellow and climate negotiator Prodipto Ghosh hits back: "If you don't trust scientists, who else will you trust?" From terming the demand for resignation of IPCC head R K Pachauri "knee-jerk" reaction to admitting there is no substantial evidence to prove the extent of glaciers melting, Ghosh tells TOI what went wrong: How could such a goof-up occur?We don't have much data going back in time. The data we have is from the Zoological Survey of India, but it's not sufficient to arrive at any conclusion or any generalization on the state of the Himalayan glaciers. The IPCC problem arose because Prof Hasnain (who first went public that glaciers would disappear by 2035) said there is a rapid decline of glaciers attributing it to climate change. It was not rectified by IPCC. Due diligence was not done, carelessness happens sometimes.There are demands for R K Pachauri's resignation. Will he resign?Pachauri has nothing to do with this. He is not the author of the report. When he spoke about the deadline of glaciers melting, Prof Hasnain was not even with Teri \u2014 he was with JNU. Pachauri has been appointed by governments, not a bunch of people. The issue about his resignation is only a knee-jerk reaction. He will not resign.Do we have any real data at all on the receding Himalayan glaciers?We have data from the Wadia Institute, the Zoological Survey of India, Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development which is nearly 50 years old.

a((VLONDON: A major Antarctic glacier has passed its "tipping point" and is poised to collapse that could raise global sea levels by 24cm, British scientists have claimed.According to a University of Oxford team which has developed a three dimensional model to explore changes in the ice sheet, Pine Island glacier (PIG) has lost increasing amounts of ice over the past decades.In 2004, satellite observations showed that PIG, one of the many glaciers at the fringes of the West Antarctic ice sheet, had started to thin and that ice was flowing into the Amundsen Sea 25 per cent faster than it had 30 years before.Now, the new study found that PIG has probably passed a critical "tipping point" and is irreversibly on track to lose 50 per cent of its ice in as little as 100 years, significantly raising global sea levels.The researchers, however admitted that their model can represent only a simplified version of the physics that govern changes in glaciers, but said if anything, the model is optimistic and PIG will disappear faster than it projects, journal Proceedings of the Royal Society said.By raising sea levels and therefore the grounding line, in their model, the researchers led by Richard Katz were able to find the point of no return beyond which the glacier would be unable to recover.According to Katz's model, the grounding line probably passed over the crest in 1996 and is now poised to enter a period of accelerated shrinking.The model suggests that within 100 years, PIG's grounding line could have retreated over 200 kilometres.

a((VIndustrial Revolution started in mid 18th century in Europe. For close to 100 years human civilisation used coal to power its ships, trains, power plants to produce electricity, stoves at home to cook food and to keep themselves warm from biting cold during winters.\u000a\u000aSince the dawn of 20th century another fuel option was added to it that had equal ability to pollute our environment. It was petroleum. Over night all the ships started running on new fuel. A new medium of transport \u2013 airplane used it in ever-increasing quantity.\u000a\u000aAfter the Second World War ended in 1945 and many nations in Asia and Africa came out of colonial rule their aspiration for good living led to rapid increase in the use of public transport, mechanization of agriculture, air travel and industrialsation. Smoke and smog filled cities and dock areas, stench of diesel and petrol fumes in the air, skin and other health disorders, respiratory problems all of them were considered par for the course if you were on the path of development.\u000a\u000aThe first theory of global warming came in 1824 when French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier discovered that the Earth's temperature was slowly increasing. Fourier argued that the earth's atmosphere traps solar radiation and reflects it back toward the earth.\u000a\u000aIn the late 19th century Fourier's theory was labeled the \u201cgreenhouse effect" when Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius coined the term to explain how CO2 traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere. He was the first one to come with a hypothesis that carbondioxide and water vapour absorbed sun\u2019s heat and maintained earth\u2019s average surface temperature at 15 degree celcius. Till the second half of the 20th century scientists didn\u2019t take this theory seriously.\u000a\u000aHowever, in the 1950s, amateur scientist G.S. Callendar warned that the greenhouse effect was true and dramatically impacting the atmosphere of the Earth. Callendar's claims were termed the "Callendar effect," and led to increased research on global warming. Within two decades scientist developed many models to measure how climate was behaving and how various gases were impacting it. Also they tried to figure out how much of it was man made.\u000a\u000aWhile the research was on scientific community was divided over their own finding. Some were of the opinion that the globe was cooling while the others argued that the CO2 and other greenhouse gases were on the rise and so eventually it would lead to an increase in the temperature worldwide.\u000a\u000aFinally in the 1980's the global annual mean temperature curve started to rise. By late 1980's the rising trend was so steep that the global warming theory gained currency among the educated elite of the world. Scientist Stephen Schneider had first predicted global warming in 1976.\u000a\u000aAccording to International Protocol on Climate Change (IPCC), United Nation\u2019s body that looks into climate related issues, global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) between the start and the end of the 20th century. The IPCC\u2019s latest findings suggest that most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century was caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel (Coal and petroleum) burning and cutting down of forests.\u000a\u000aUsing climate models\u2019 projections in the latest IPCC report it looks that the global surface temperature will probably rise a further 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) during the twenty-first century. The uncertainty in this estimate arises from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations and the use of differing estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions.

I check my car\u2019s Pollution Under Control certificate every day, walk to the grocer\u2019s, and generally make little sacrifices to make the world a better place.\u000a\u000aI was starting to think all my efforts \u2014 and those of countless unsung others \u2014 are beginning to pay off. I\u2019ve been feeling rather cold for the past month. In fact, very cold. My legs are often frozen all the way up to my unmentionables. I have to drink a stiff vodka before I can work up the courage to enter the bathroom in the morning. In other words, the part of the globe I live in \u2014 Delhi \u2014 has not exactly been hot.\u000a\u000aHowever I am only a layman, and I believe in experts, so I didn\u2019t buy a heater. In fact, I even postponed buying a new sweater. Surely global warming can\u2019t have turned tail already, I kept telling myself. The Himalayan glaciers are melting. Soon, it will be warm. Next year, Delhi will probably have no winter, and I will have to walk to office to reduce my carbon footprint and bring the fog back. The year after that, we may even celebrate New Year\u2019s by the beach in Gurgaon, since as you know, sea levels are rising alarmingly.\u000a\u000aNow I\u2019m a little mortified to read that the glaciers may not be melting after all. What\u2019s more, a bunch of scientists I had not heard of before are saying an ice age could be on its way. This winter has been bitterly cold across the northern hemisphere, and the hitherto unheard of gurus of climate change are saying it\u2019s only the start of a cooling trend.\u000a\u000aA Russian astronomer named Khabibullo Abdusamatov from St Petersburg has predicted the next ice age will start between 2035 and 2045 due to a decline in solar activity. He also says the warming trend in recent years was simply because the sun was pumping out more heat. Apparently, the sun has its hot and cold periods. Abdusamatov\u2019s not a fan of carbon trading, I think.\u000a\u000aLess Russian sources \u2014 like, for example, the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado \u2014 have reported a jump in the Arctic summer sea ice by 26 per cent over the past two years. It had hit a low in 2007, but has recovered spectacularly since. And this was before Copenhagen, before I even started walking to the grocer\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust months \u2014 that\u2019s how long it took for Europe to be engulfed by an ice age. The scenario, which comes straight out of Hollywood blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow, was revealed by the most precise record of the climate from palaeohistory ever generated,\u201d said New Scientist last November.\u000a\u000aThe most precise record of the climate showed that 12,800 years ago there was an ice age funky scientists call the Big Freeze. It froze up most of the northern hemisphere in less than a year. The scientists from Canada who carried out the study said the effect would be like \u201ctaking Ireland and moving it up to Svalbard in the Arctic\u201d. I guess if we moved Delhi by a few notches less than that, we\u2019d end up in cool, scenic Ladakh.\u000a\u000aThing is, now I\u2019m no longer sure what I should do for the planet. How do I make the world a better place today? Should I try to warm it because an ice age is coming, or cool it because global warming is upon us?\u000a\u000aI think for starters I will throw an uttapam at a scientist today.

But all of us were unanimously of the view that its value lies not as a standalone document but as an input into the two-track negotiation process under UNFCCC,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is not a legal document. It is a political agreement, a political statement. In conclusion, the understanding reached at Copenhagen was that the accord will facilitate two track negotiating process which is the only legitimate process to reach to a legally binding treaty in Mexico,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh said the rich nations should demonstrate their seriousness on the climate issue by giving 10 billion dollars to the Least Developed Countries (LDC) and small island states as promised at Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aAsked about reports that the UN had decided to extend the deadline to declare voluntary mitigation actions, South African Minister for Water and Environmental Affairs Buyelwa Sonjica said the BASIC countries would stick to the January 31 deadline.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe feel obligated that we must commit what we ourselves were part of. That\u2019s a leadership obligation, even if the UN has decided to extend the deadline,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe BASIC countries said they would meet every quarter to consolidate the group and explore avenues for cooperation in climate science, forestry and other related matters.\u000a\u000aThe next meeting of the BASIC groups would be held in April in Cape Town.\u000a\u000aTo a question whether the BASIC bloc would fund any mitigation actions, Brazilian Environment Minister Carlos Minc said individually each of the four countries was involved in supporting LDCs in Latin America, Africa and Asia.\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh said each of the BASIC nations has been supporting adaptation projects through individual assistance programmes.\u000a\u000aHe said the four leaders discussed supporting such programmes collectively but no conclusion could be reached on the issue. \u201cThe next meeting would bring more clarity on this,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMs. Sonjica asked the US to take a leadership role in the climate change talks and actions. \u201cThe US was lagging behind in Copenhagen.

a((VCHANDIGARH: Glaciers are here to stay in the Himalayas. Studies conducted by glaciologists across the Himalayan region in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have shown that global warming has little to do with their melting.The conclusion was drawn by glaciologists after studying the behaviour of 35 Himalayan glaciers . The Mentossa glacier in Miyar valley of Lahaul-Spiti in Himachal Pradesh has, in fact, expanded in the last few years while there is no change in the Kangriz glacier in Zanskar valley of J&K since 1913.Glaciologists, claiming that global warming and melting of glaciers have no relation with each other, say each glacier is behaving in a different manner. Had global warming been responsible, then all of them would have behaved in a similar manner, they claimed.The prediction that glaciers would melt by 2035 by Professor Syed Iqbal Hasnain may have landed the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chairman R K Pachauri in a tight spot, but data collected by glaciologits across the Himalayan region shows that such claims do not hold water, and the major rivers orginitaing from the Himalayas would continue to flow for the years to come as the glaciers are going to stay.Glaciologist Milap Chand Sharma from Jawaharlal Nehru University says after studying 27 glaciers in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, he has found that the melting taking place is normal. His conclusion is based on study of the behaviour of glaciers from 1975 to 2008.The Miyar glacier in Lahaul region covers an area of 27 square km. Since 1971, it has receded by just 150 meters. If it continues to melt at this pace, it would take around 3,000 years for it to melt completely, he added.A comparison of photographs of glaciers available from 1907 shows that after 1998, glaciesr have not changed much, says Sharma.

a((VJAIPUR: When he left his home in London in a souped-up Mercedes school bus, Andy Pag had only a few spiders for company. They had built webs in the corners of the bus and he thought they would keep the mosquitoes away; a pretty useful thing given that Pag had a real long journey to make: a journey across the world in about 365 days.That was three and a half months ago. Since then he has travelled some 13,500 km, travelling from London to France to Switzerland, Iran, Pakistan, and finally India. On Wednesday, he was in Jaipur, a stopover before he drives off to Pushkar, Mumbai and Kathmandu.Actually, the route is a little flexible. That\u2019s because Pag can\u2019t be sure where he will get fuel next. After all, if you want to drive around the world using only biofuel, it can be very, very difficult.But that was the whole point of this Biotruck Expedition: trying to see if this could be a way to reduce ones carbon footprint. Pag, a 34-year-old engineer who\u2019s dabbled in different things from investigative journalism for the BBC to filmmaking, wants to see if he can go around the globe and emit less than two tonnes of carbon dioxide. That\u2019s the amount the G20 nations have agreed to cap CO2 emission per person per annum by 2050. If this happens, the chances of global temperatures rising 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century will drop to 3% from 50% at present.So it was to spread the message on global warming and also find out what people in different parts of the world were doing to reduce their carbon footprint that Pag planned this expedition. He took time off from work - which at present is running a small web-based business broadcasting big fat Indian weddings in the UK to their relatives here - and decided to buy an old vehicle.He settled for a 20-year-old Merc school bus that had been given up for good. It was high enough inside for Pag - he\u2019s 6-feet-five - to stand, and also wide enough for him to sleep comfortably. It cost him only 850 pounds or just over Rs 60,000. Then began the three-month remodelling and refitting. Solar panels went up on the roof, and inside, a mammoth 1,500-litre tank was fitted to store biofuel (because you never know where you will get your supply next). The engine, too, was tinkered with.Above the fuel tank now sits a bed. There\u2019s even a shower (that isn\u2019t functioning at the moment) and a WC (which is doing fine). A small work area was also created with solar-powered charging points for laptops. And for all this recycled material was used. For instance, discarded baskets from supermarkets (most of them from Tesco) have made nice drawers to store away daily stuff.

a((VLONDON: Amid a possible new row for 'wrongly' linking global warming to a rise in natural disasters, the UN climate panel has underlined that it was reassessing the evidence for surge in hurricanes and floods around the globe.The latest criticism of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change headed by India's R K Pachauri comes after the panel admitted its mistake in asserting that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035.The report also included another claim that rapidly rising costs from events such as floods and hurricanes were linked to climate change."We are reassessing the evidence and will publish a report on natural disasters and extreme weather with the latest findings. Despite recent events the IPCC process is still very rigorous and scientific," The Sunday Times quoted Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair of the IPCC as saying.According to the newspaper, the panel based the claims on an unpublished report that had not been subjected to routine scientific scrutiny - and ignored warnings from scientific advisers. The report's author later withdrew the claim because the evidence was too weak.The link was central to demands at last month's Copenhagen climate summit by African nations for compensation of USD 100 billion from the rich nations blamed for creating the most emissions.According to the newspaper, the panel knew in 2008 that the link could not be proved but did not alert world leaders. Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change minister, has suggested British and overseas floods - such as those in Bangladesh in 2007 - could be linked to global warming.US President Barack Obama said last autumn: "More powerful storms and floods threaten every continent."In another report, The Sunday Telegraph said the scientist whose report originally claimed that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035, has for the past two years been working as a senior employee of The Energy and Resources Institute, (TERI) the Delhi-based company of which Pachauri is director-general.The new controversy also goes back to the IPCC's 2007 report in which a separate section warned that the world had "suffered rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s".It said a part of this increase was due to global warming. The academic paper at the centre of the latest questions was written in 2006 by Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at Risk Management Solutions, a London consultancy, who later became a contributing author to the section of the IPCC's 2007 report dealing with climate change impacts.Muir-Wood wanted to find out if the 8 per cent year-on-year increase in global losses caused by weather-related disasters. He found from 1950 to 2005 there was no increase in the impact of disasters once growth was accounted for. For 1970-2005, however, he found a 2 per cent annual increase which "corresponded with a period of rising global temperatures."

a((VNEW DELHI: The hits to IPCC and R K Pachauri just don't seem to stop. In the latest embarrassment to the Nobel-winning body, British daily 'Telegraph' has published details on IPCC's dire prediction regarding the huge depletion of Amazon forests, which was based on unverified reports.The daily said the IPCC forecast about the loss of Amazon forests because of "even a slight reduction in precipitation" came from a journal that was not peer-reviewed. Coming after the disclosure, and acknowledgement, that its warning of 'meltdown' of Himalayan glaciers by 2035 was based on speculation, the latest expose will further undercut IPCC's credibility.According to the article, Pachauri is under fire for setting a death-date for the Amazon forests. With this, Pachauri's "robust and solid" monitoring system for preparing the IPCC assessment report has been completely shorn of respectability.In its report, the Telegraph suggests that IPCC did not independently research the claims. It says the claims were lifted off a report done by the WWF, an advocacy group.According to the British paper, the two 'expert' authors of the WWF cited in the IPCC report are, in fact, not Amazon specialists. One, Dr P F Moore, is a policy analyst while the other, Andy Rowell, is a freelance journalist and a green activist.

Of course, they will provide funds," Saran said.Prime minister Manmohan Singh launched the National Solar Mission that aims to generate 20,000 MW solar power by 2022 recently. The mission is one of the eight announced as India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).Besides solar mission, India plans to deal with global warming through achieving enhanced energy efficiency, promoting a sustainable habitat, efficient use of water, sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, increasing forest cover, adapting to sustainable agriculture, and developing strategic knowledge on climate change.

a((VNEW DELHI: The Copenhagen Accord will not become an official consensus decision under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change with Cuba formally rejecting it. The formal submission by Cuba to the UN opposing the controversial accord, comes after four countries -- Venezuela, Bolvia, Cuba and Sudan -- had opposed it during the recently concluded climate meet.Within India, the risk and consequences of the government listing its domestic action to reduce emission intensity under the accord has now become a controversial issue.With confusion still prevailing on the legal status as well as implications of signing on to the Copenhagen Accord, the hosts of the recently concluded acrimonious climate talks, Denmark, have asked countries to indicate their approval of the accord by January-end. India is expected to reflect its professed domestic and voluntary mitigation actions -- the target of reducing emission intensity by 20-25% by 2020 that UPA had earlier announced -- in the Copenhagen Accord.The accord, for the first time in the history of climate negotiations, requires developing countries to list their domestic actions for mitigation in an international document.With the UN climate convention secretariat claiming that it is still `conducting a legal analysis of the matter', the vote is still out on how the `internationalising' of the domestic targets would impact the negotiations on the two formal tracks -- the developed world targets under Kyoto Protocol and a long-term agreement -- that are to be held on 2010.While the UPA has admitted that the Copenhagen Accord leaves the window open for the Kyoto Protocol to be buried in future, it has claimed to be committed to ensuring that the developed countries that are party to it provide ambitious targets to reduce emissions in its second phase that starts in 2013.But observers, government officials and experts are vary that India and other developing countries listing their domestic targets in the controversial accord that they accepted after immense haggling with the US, could undermine the official negotiations.The government is yet to clarify if it would only internationalise the macro target of 20-25% emission intensity reduction target on the Copenhagen Accord or give sector-wise breakdowns of its actions.The government had already come in for flak for announcing a macro target, under international pressure, without having done its homework on how it would be achieved. The Planning Commission is now expected to set up an expert group to do a reverse engineering process to determine which industrial sector would have to bear the costs of the emission intensity reductions.But worries within the government remain about the implications of then putting the broken down targets under the accord. Even though the accord is not a legally binding document, international policy experts have pointed out that an agreement signed by the most influential 20-odd countries across the world would by default weigh heavy on the governments that decide to associate themselves with it.At the moment, only Australia, Canada, Papua New Guinea and the Maldives have decided so. While the two industrialized countries are seen as close allies of the US at the climate talks, Maldives, part of the G77 grouping otherwise, was seen in Copenhagen to break ranks with developing countries and demand actions to reduce emissions from the emerging large economies such as India and China.

The chief US negotiator, Jonathan Pershing, was reported stating that US was not confidant of the UN managing the start up finance of US $30 billion the rich countries have offered under the accord."I am not sure that any of us are particularly confident that the UN managing the near-term financing is the right way to go," he was reported saying.His statement made at a think tank meeting came against the backdrop of Cuba taking on the UN Secretary General in very strong words, formally demanding to know what Ban ki-Moon's legal status was to intervene in a biased-fashion in the debate. The UNSG had come under increasing criticism at Copenhagen for reflecting US views on the climate talks and again drawn flack recently for suggesting that each country put its economy-wide targets under the accord, which would turn into a legally binding agreement in future. The BASIC countries, which includes India, had fought hard at the Danish capital to ensure that the contentious accord does not become a legally binding document.While the rich countries have promised in the Copenhagen Accord to mobilize US $30 billion as a start up fund for the most vulnerable countries developing countries have been wary that the funds and other mechanisms could now be managed under less democratic institutions like the G20 (a meeting of which is due in February) or the US-backed Major Economies Forum. Pershing's statement seemed to confirm the apprehensions of the poor countries.India had also agreed to international analysis and consultation on its domestic mitigation actions under the accord. The Copenhagen Accord left it open as to who would determine the guidelines under which such scrutiny would take place. Fears were expressed that with not explicitly mandating that the guidelines would be made under UNFCCC, other forums, tilted in the favour of rich countries could take over the mandate at the cost of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which hosts the Kyoto Protocol too.The BASIC countries had already gone back on their earlier red lines at Copenhagen not insisting that all funds for climate change adaptation and mitigation to poor countries come from public finance and routed through the UN. But Pershing's statements in the US further strengthened the suspicion that the give aways had only begun and not ended at Copenhagen and that India could expect to give in more in the hectic negotiations slated for 2010.

It should have been checked by a referee before being made public,\u201d said Srinivasan, who heads IISc\u2019s Divecha Centre for Climate Change.The amount of data we have on the Himalayan glaciers is not very large. That limits the conclusions we can come to about their melting. We need more research on that eco-system. Having said that, it is estimated by scientists that many small glaciers could melt in about 40 to 50 years, while the large ones could do so over 100, 200 or 300 years as they are estimated to last that long.That clearly is a blanket statement. It should have been checked by a referee before being made public. What we know from the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, is that large Himalayan glaciers are not melting as rapidly as is surmised. In complex matters as the study of glaciers, you cannot easily give numbers. An estimate is possible but a definite number like 2035 should not have been given.It means the system of checks and balances usually applied for scientific assertions failed in this case. They just did not work.After the author-scientist has written the chapter or the first draft of it, it has to be peer-reviewed, then passed on for examination to a referee-independent expert and then to different countries for views on the scientific observation made by the author. This is the minimum procedure to establish general consensus on the validity of the observation.It is a slip-up alright, but it is only human.The Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035 is just a single statement in a single paragraph in the IPCC report that is thousands of pages big. While the statement appears in the Asia chapter as part of a paragraph, it does not appear in the Summary of Policy Makers, an extremely important doctrine of the IPCC.

( Watch Video "I have no intention to of resigning from my position. I have a task.

Climate change is not limited to Himalayan glaciers. Rational people will continue to repose faith in IPCC," he said.The IPCC chief said the Fourth Assessment Report of the Panel was a "robust report" but the error with regard to the conclusion on Himalayan glaciers was "unfortunate"."This was a human error. We will do everything to see that such mistakes are not repeated," he said.Pachauri said the IPCC will not take action against any of the authors of the report."We have no right to take any action against any author. They are not employees of IPCC," he said.The IPCC is under fire for having included in its 2007 report -- without proper peer review -- an assertion that glaciers in the Himalayas will disappear by 2035 due to global warming. It had retracted the statement just three days back.Researcher Murari Lal was in-charge of editing the chapter on glaciers in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC and had based the controversial finding on a media interview of glaciologist S I Hasnain.Pachauri said IPCC is utilising the Noble Peace Prize money for starting a cadre of scientists in different developing countries who would assess the problem of climate change in their respective regions.

File photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aChairman of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) R.K. Pachauri on Saturday ruled out his resignation in the wake of the controversy over the inclusion of unsubstantiated data in the Fourth Assessment Report, which said the Himalayan glaciers would vanish by 2035, an error for which the IPCC had to express regret. He said he was elected by all countries in the world and had a task to complete.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy job is to complete the Fifth Assessment Report. It is an unfortunate error, but this one error, which is regrettable, will no way detract us from finishing our job,\u201d he said at a press conference here.\u000a\u000aAdmitting there were more mistakes in the section, Mr. Pachauri said the IPCC had expressed regret for that.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the future, the performance of every lead author will be under scrutiny. We will exercise a higher level of surveillance to ensure that such human errors do not creep into the fifth report,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMr. Pachauri said no action could be taken against the lead authors as they were not IPCC employees.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Nobel Prize-winning IPCC\u2019s credibility was established over the last 21 years and got strengthened as we accepted the mistake,\u201d Mr. Pachauri said, asserting that its image would not be shaken by the incident.\u000a\u000aHe also ruled out a review of the remaining chapters of the Fourth Assessment report. \u201cOur procedures are robust and solid.

a((VThe ever evolving definition of hell needs a Delhi update. Hell is being trapped in a steel tube ensnared in the evil fog of an airport tarmac. Hell is helplessness as deceptive nature winks through the seeming window in a darkness flecked by swirling waves of heavy, oppressive air and then shuts it with an impenetrable, dense, grey screen as your aeroplane begins to taxi optimistically towards opportunity. Where the hell has global warming gone?\u000a\u000aShould it be considered entirely appropriate, or wickedly fortuitous, that the world has witnessed its coldest winter in a long while just after the much-vaunted gathering of the high, low, mighty and weak at the Copenhagen conference on global warming? The conference itself produced a molehill of unimplementable phrases out of a mountain of hype; the charter could not tie China to Togo or America to Tonga despite the presence of an extraordinary collection of worthies who tried their level best to disguise their failure behind the fanfare of promotion. The dramatics started much before the meet: the Maldives held a Cabinet meeting on its ocean-bed and Nepal on Mount Everest.\u000a\u000aNot to be outdone, our own acrobatic and hirsute minister for environment, Jairam Ramesh, flipped a breathtaking triple somersault. But no resolution was actually adopted by the 192 nations present and five countries would not even deign to pretend they agreed. No one gave any commitment on reduction of carbon emissions that could be held to account because it was not required. Big boys sniffed at the kids, who hollered for more pocket money. China would not even permit nations like Germany, who had come with commitments, to record their percentages lest it become a precedent that it would be compelled to follow. In the classic manner of those who have little to offer, it sought, and got, agreement to talk another time, as if a conference in Delhi was going to ever be the success that Copenhagen had been unable to deliver. The reason was never stated, but is now becoming apparent: there is a growing suspicion that climate theology has been constructed out of shaky testament.\u000a\u000aHypocrisy might be the least of our travails by the time details fully unravel. We might be staring at a PR process over the last few years during which bombast and academic fraud with multiple epicentres, one of them Delhi, has been richly rewarded with grants, respectability and what used to be the highest of accolades, the Nobel Prize for Peace.\u000a\u000aWhat is the difference between a band and a bandwagon? The first turns into the second when the trumpets begin to play false notes, and the world applauds it as revolutionary music.\u000a\u000aThe 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was won jointly by Al Gore, father of climate change, and a United Nations body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The latter created a worldwide brouhaha by announcing that it was \u2018most likely\u2019 that Himalayan glaciers were in retreat and would disappear by 2035. It was the perfect horizon: too far for anyone making the prediction to be alive in that year, and close enough to frighten the wits out of alarmists. \u2018Most likely\u2019 means, in such parlance, a 95% probability. The evidence for such a dramatic conclusion came, it now transpires, from a single interview given by an Indian glacier specialist (a former vice chancellor of universities now working for the government of Sikkim) 10 years ago to the New Scientist. TERI gave him a reasonably comfortable retirement benefit at its comfortable Delhi premises and its director, now in his avatar as Cardinal Green of Pope Gore, went on to share the limelight in Oslo. The scientist was comforted by a Padma Shri \u2014 not bad, but not quite a Nobel Prize. The New York Times has now reported that this scientist (let us leave him nameless) claims he was \u2018misquoted\u2019 in that original interview. As misquotes go, this must surely be the most glistening jewel in the baggage train of a bandwagon.\u000a\u000aNo one stops a roll on its way to reward, so we should not be too surprised that this particular scientist did not notice he had been misquoted while the Nobel was being doled out. What is astonishing is the absence of any due diligence by the Nobel committee. Sceptics have suggested that the Peace award to US President Barack Obama was egg on Oslo\u2019s face; well, this was a whole hatchery. Maybe Nobel has simply run out of candidates for the Peace Prize. Peace is not the favourite pastime of our times, and is too relative. Nobel should rename the award: Sanctimonious Prize? Brand Value Prize? Holy Cow Prize?\u000a\u000aThe dark fog of nature can never compete with the oily smog of human nature.

He said buildings would have to comply with the requirement of at least 3-star rating under the GRIHA scheme. Efforts would be, however, made for higher rating by such buildings subject to the site condition, as western rating systems were not suited for Indian climate.\u000a\u000aUnder the GRIHA scheme, buildings would be rated by technical expertise from TERI, which is headed by R.K. Pachauri. The aim of a green building design was to minimise the demand for non-renewable sources and maximise its utilisation.\u000a\u000aEmphasising on integrating traditional heritage with scientific tools, the Minister said even small dwelling units being constructed under the Indira Awas Yojna could be brought under the GRIHA scheme to ensure sustainability.\u000a\u000aDeepak Gupta, Secretary in the Renewable Ministry, said the CPWD had adopted GRIHA rating and efforts were on to spread awareness in this direction among the stakeholders concerned, including builders and architects. \u201cA technical group has also been constituted to study the feasibility of GRIHA in larger areas such as townships and campus. The team will submit its report within the next six months.\u201d Buildings would be rated on the basis of design, system design, including ventilation, water and waste management, indoor environmental quality and selection of ecologically sustainable materials.

a((VMUMBAI: If globalisation was the driving factor for Tata Group in the last decade, going green may well be the buzzword for the present one. From being on the fringe, the green movement is gaining momentum within the group. India\u2019s oldest industrial house is stepping up efforts to reduce its carbon footprint across the value chain \u2014 from manufacturing processes to distribution networks to eco-friendly consumer products.For instance, Tata Steel aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at its Jamshedpur plant from the current 1.8 tonne to 1.7 tonne per tonne of liquid steel made by 2012. The ideal global benchmark though is 1.5.Tata Motors is setting up an eco-friendly showroom using natural building material for its flooring and energy-efficient lights. Tata Motors said the project is at a preliminary stage.The Indian Hotels Company, which runs the Taj chain, is in the process of creating eco rooms which will have energy-efficient mini bars, organic bed linen and napkins made from recycled paper. But there won\u2019t be any carpets since chemicals are used to clean those. And when it comes to illumination, the rooms will have CFLs or LEDs. About 5% of the total rooms at a Taj hotel would sport a chic eco-room design.One of the most interesting innovations has come in the form of a biogas-based power plant at Taj Green Cove in Kovalam, which uses the waste generated at the hotel to meet its cooking requirements.Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata had said during Swatch launch, a low-cost water a low-cost water purifier made from natural ingredients: \u201cWe have embarked on a group-wise initiative to create awareness and implement eco-friendly processes wherever it is possible and, in fact, look at some of our older processes to see how we can ensure that they are in compliance with the state-of-the-art exhibits. This is going to be a long and expensive journey and we are fairly committed to it.\u201dAnother eco-friendly consumer product that is in the works is Indica EV, an electric car that will run on polymer lithium ion batteries. Tata Motors plans to introduce the Indica EV in select European markets this year. The group\u2019s large companies such as Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Chemicals and Tata Consultancy Services contribute 80% of the group\u2019s overall emissions and a panel, headed by Tata Sons director JJ Irani, has been formed to address this issue. Several companies have already or are in the process of implementing clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. Tata Steel said it is currently working on more than 17 CDM projects with Ernst & Young and these projects are at various stages of approval at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Tata Power has said that of the total power it would generate in the next 10 years, 25% would be from renewable energy sources.Tata Motors is collecting environmental and energy data across its dealer and supply chain to compute their carbon footprint and identity opportunities for cutting down on carbon dioxide emission. This initiative will enable sharing and deployment of ideas throughout the value chain, said a Tata Motors spokesperson.A source in Indian Hotels said that all of its domestic and international hotels would be certified by Green Globe, an international agency by the end of 2010.

The institute, which is hosting its annual international business symposium \u2014 Intaglio, from January 7-10, is aiming the event to be a carbon-neutral event. This means IIM-C students will ensure they reduce the environmental impact or carbon footprint of the event. The institute also claims this is the first time a B-school has taken an initiative to carbon-neutralise an event.\u000a\u000aThis will be done through a number of environment-friendly measures such as using notepads and bags made of recycled paper and encouraging the use of social networking sites, emails and SMSes to publicise the event. \u201cEarlier, we would get hundreds of posters printed and send them to B-schools across the country. This year, we have managed to cut such printing by 60% and are instead publicising the event through networking sites,\u201d says Ram Shankar, a PGP student at IIM-C and member of the Intaglio organising team.\u000a\u000aThe team has also tied up with a Gurgaon-based climate change consulting company, Emergent Ventures, to map the event\u2019s carbon footprint and offset it with the footprint saved. The firm will later conduct an audit of the event, and judge if it proved to be carbon-neutral. The institute has even put up shades of brown and lighter colours on the event website, in an attempt to reduce the wattage consumed by computer screens. Participants will also be encouraged to use public transport to come to the campus.\u000a\u000aIntaglio organisers have decided to use carbon credits, which can cost anywhere between $5-20 per credit, post the event. \u201cThis money will be put to use in planting trees or investing in renewable energy,\u201d says Emergent VenturesCEO Ashutosh Pandey.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

a((VLONDON: A major Antarctic glacier has passed its "tipping point" and is poised to collapse that could raise global sea levels by 24cm, British scientists have claimed.According to a University of Oxford team which has developed a three dimensional model to explore changes in the ice sheet, Pine Island glacier (PIG) has lost increasing amounts of ice over the past decades.In 2004, satellite observations showed that PIG, one of the many glaciers at the fringes of the West Antarctic ice sheet, had started to thin and that ice was flowing into the Amundsen Sea 25 per cent faster than it had 30 years before.Now, the new study found that PIG has probably passed a critical "tipping point" and is irreversibly on track to lose 50 per cent of its ice in as little as 100 years, significantly raising global sea levels.The researchers, however admitted that their model can represent only a simplified version of the physics that govern changes in glaciers, but said if anything, the model is optimistic and PIG will disappear faster than it projects, journal Proceedings of the Royal Society said.By raising sea levels and therefore the grounding line, in their model, the researchers led by Richard Katz were able to find the point of no return beyond which the glacier would be unable to recover.According to Katz's model, the grounding line probably passed over the crest in 1996 and is now poised to enter a period of accelerated shrinking.The model suggests that within 100 years, PIG's grounding line could have retreated over 200 kilometres.

a((VLONDON: Amid a possible new row for 'wrongly' linking global warming to a rise in natural disasters, the UN climate panel has underlined that it was reassessing the evidence for surge in hurricanes and floods around the globe.The latest criticism of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change headed by India's R K Pachauri comes after the panel admitted its mistake in asserting that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035.The report also included another claim that rapidly rising costs from events such as floods and hurricanes were linked to climate change."We are reassessing the evidence and will publish a report on natural disasters and extreme weather with the latest findings. Despite recent events the IPCC process is still very rigorous and scientific," The Sunday Times quoted Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair of the IPCC as saying.According to the newspaper, the panel based the claims on an unpublished report that had not been subjected to routine scientific scrutiny - and ignored warnings from scientific advisers. The report's author later withdrew the claim because the evidence was too weak.The link was central to demands at last month's Copenhagen climate summit by African nations for compensation of USD 100 billion from the rich nations blamed for creating the most emissions.According to the newspaper, the panel knew in 2008 that the link could not be proved but did not alert world leaders. Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change minister, has suggested British and overseas floods - such as those in Bangladesh in 2007 - could be linked to global warming.US President Barack Obama said last autumn: "More powerful storms and floods threaten every continent."In another report, The Sunday Telegraph said the scientist whose report originally claimed that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035, has for the past two years been working as a senior employee of The Energy and Resources Institute, (TERI) the Delhi-based company of which Pachauri is director-general.The new controversy also goes back to the IPCC's 2007 report in which a separate section warned that the world had "suffered rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s".It said a part of this increase was due to global warming. The academic paper at the centre of the latest questions was written in 2006 by Robert Muir-Wood, head of research at Risk Management Solutions, a London consultancy, who later became a contributing author to the section of the IPCC's 2007 report dealing with climate change impacts.Muir-Wood wanted to find out if the 8 per cent year-on-year increase in global losses caused by weather-related disasters. He found from 1950 to 2005 there was no increase in the impact of disasters once growth was accounted for. For 1970-2005, however, he found a 2 per cent annual increase which "corresponded with a period of rising global temperatures."

a((VThe evolution of the policy framework for renewable energy dovetails dual national considerations: the need to enhance energy availability for rapid growth, and mitigating impact of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe policy thrust for rapid energy growth has been built over the past two decades as the country embarked on the path of rapid economic growth.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn recent years, specific to the growing concerns on climate change, the government has released the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising eight National Missions \u2014 in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, and water, sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, Green India, sustainable agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change \u2014 representing multi-pronged, long-term and integrated strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSimultaneously, the government has embarked on the roadmap for tax reforms, involving the introduction of the goods and services tax and the new direct taxes code. The alignment of these policies for energy growth, climate change and fiscal framework is critical for effective and sustainable growth.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe developments so far: The renewable energy potential (excluding solar) is estimated at 90,000 mw for energy / power generation \u2014 India proposes to leverage 50% (i.e., 15,000 mw during each Plan period) of the potential over the next three Plans.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo foster country\u2019s economic development led by clean and energy-efficient fuels, there is a need to gradually shift its dependence of energy from fossil fuels to non-fossil fuels comprising solar, wind, hydro, biomass, fuel wood, hydrogen, fuel cells, tidal, geo-thermal, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the initial years, the policy thrust for renewable energy was delivered primarily by fiscal incentives. In the 1990s, tax holidays and accelerated tax depreciation was introduced that has predominantly provided impetus to the growth of the wind energy capacity in the country.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCurrently, renewable energy has a 9% share of the country\u2019s installed power generation capacity, with wind energy accounting for 70% of the total installed renewable energy generation capacity. The balance is being contributed by small hydro, grid and off-grid solar, co-generation, biomass, urban and industrial waste.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince the initial years, the scale and size of the energy demand and the imperatives for renewable energy have undergone a paradigm shift. This is coupled with the profound technology breakthroughs in the previous decade, along with heightened concerns on the emission of greenhouse gases by traditional energy options.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo address the opportunities from new technologies and thinking and challenges from climate change, the government in the recent years has revamped the regulatory framework for these sectors, comprising of the following:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a*Creating Bureau of Energy Efficiency to promote energy-efficiency,\u000a\u000a*New and improved tariff regulations for procurement of energy from renewable sources,\u000a\u000a*Generation-based incentive schemes for solar and wind, and\u000a\u000a*Obligation for renewable energy purchase and creation of platform for trading in renewable energy certificates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

a((VIndustrial Revolution started in mid 18th century in Europe. For close to 100 years human civilisation used coal to power its ships, trains, power plants to produce electricity, stoves at home to cook food and to keep themselves warm from biting cold during winters.\u000a\u000aSince the dawn of 20th century another fuel option was added to it that had equal ability to pollute our environment. It was petroleum. Over night all the ships started running on new fuel. A new medium of transport \u2013 airplane used it in ever-increasing quantity.\u000a\u000aAfter the Second World War ended in 1945 and many nations in Asia and Africa came out of colonial rule their aspiration for good living led to rapid increase in the use of public transport, mechanization of agriculture, air travel and industrialsation. Smoke and smog filled cities and dock areas, stench of diesel and petrol fumes in the air, skin and other health disorders, respiratory problems all of them were considered par for the course if you were on the path of development.\u000a\u000aThe first theory of global warming came in 1824 when French mathematician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier discovered that the Earth's temperature was slowly increasing. Fourier argued that the earth's atmosphere traps solar radiation and reflects it back toward the earth.\u000a\u000aIn the late 19th century Fourier's theory was labeled the \u201cgreenhouse effect" when Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius coined the term to explain how CO2 traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere. He was the first one to come with a hypothesis that carbondioxide and water vapour absorbed sun\u2019s heat and maintained earth\u2019s average surface temperature at 15 degree celcius. Till the second half of the 20th century scientists didn\u2019t take this theory seriously.\u000a\u000aHowever, in the 1950s, amateur scientist G.S. Callendar warned that the greenhouse effect was true and dramatically impacting the atmosphere of the Earth. Callendar's claims were termed the "Callendar effect," and led to increased research on global warming. Within two decades scientist developed many models to measure how climate was behaving and how various gases were impacting it. Also they tried to figure out how much of it was man made.\u000a\u000aWhile the research was on scientific community was divided over their own finding. Some were of the opinion that the globe was cooling while the others argued that the CO2 and other greenhouse gases were on the rise and so eventually it would lead to an increase in the temperature worldwide.\u000a\u000aFinally in the 1980's the global annual mean temperature curve started to rise. By late 1980's the rising trend was so steep that the global warming theory gained currency among the educated elite of the world. Scientist Stephen Schneider had first predicted global warming in 1976.\u000a\u000aAccording to International Protocol on Climate Change (IPCC), United Nation\u2019s body that looks into climate related issues, global surface temperature increased 0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) between the start and the end of the 20th century. The IPCC\u2019s latest findings suggest that most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century was caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel (Coal and petroleum) burning and cutting down of forests.\u000a\u000aUsing climate models\u2019 projections in the latest IPCC report it looks that the global surface temperature will probably rise a further 1.1 to 6.4 °C (2.0 to 11.5 °F) during the twenty-first century. The uncertainty in this estimate arises from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations and the use of differing estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions.

What is the price she has to pay? The world today is divided into four groups \u2013\u000a\u000a1. United States of America, European Union and other developed nations\u000a\u000a2. Emerging economies \u2013 China, India, Brazil and South Africa\u000a\u000a3. G-77 nations \u2013 Originally a group of 130 nations but now represented by Africa and other developing countries.\u000a\u000a4. AOSIS \u2013 Alliance of Small Island States. These island states are the most vulnerable as they would be submerged when the sea rises.\u000a\u000aThese four groups have different views on tackling climate change and bearing cost and responsibility. While the developing countries and emerging economies insist that the developed countries that have been polluting the world since Industrial Revolution should bear the entire cost of clean up, the developed countries insist that emerging economies like China and India should also chip in as they too have become huge polluters.\u000a\u000aEmission rates, right to development, rate of decrease in emission and scrutiny of emission reduction efforts are issues that have stalled quick progress in mitigating efforts. After Copenhagen Summit (December 7-18, 2009) this is where nations stand vis-à-vis climate change efforts.

They could attract crowds to rival the 1.8 million who turned out in 2008, where the star attraction was the Nano.\u000a\u000aBut the companies themselves admit a growing skepticism over next-gen vehicles.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur problem in India is electricity,\u201d Maruti Suzuki Chairman R.C. Bhargava told the Hindustan Times. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have electricity, and if your electricity anyway comes from coal, I am wondering, what objective that (electric vehicles) would meet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are also enthusiastic at Maruti-Suzuki, and our engineers are very keen, but no one has given me a satisfactory answer to this question.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter decades of false starts, new technology is allowing electric cars (1 lakh may be on India\u2019s roads by the end of the year, up from 85,000 now) to be driven farther than ever before at a running cost a third cheaper conventional cousins.\u000a\u000aThe new Reva, for instance, has a claimed range of 160 km. That compensates for the higher costs of electric cars: Typically Rs 1 lakh or more than petrol- or diesel-driven vehicles.\u000a\u000aBut in this age of globalisation, two complex, long-term dilemmas face India: Coal and Bolivia.\u000a\u000aOne, with more than 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s electricity coming from coal-fired plants \u2014 implicated in warming the planet \u2014 tax breaks and other incentives to electric vehicles might actually further environmental damage.\u000a\u000aTwo, most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (tiny amounts are vital to power laptops and cellphones), but if lithium use explodes as it\u2019s projected to, the biggest hurdle comes from a barren, salt desert in the heart of South America.\u000a\u000aThe global market for automotive lithium batteries is forecast at $70 billion (Rs 3.3 lakh crore) annually by 2020, dwarfing the lithium market for cellphones and laptops, currently at $7 billion (Rs 33,000 crore), according to Ener1, a leading Norwegian-US battery maker.\u000a\u000aIf that is to happen, someone will have to crack the Salar-de-Uyuni problem.\u000a\u000aMore than half the world\u2019s reserves of lithium, the lightest metal used by industry, come from the great salt expanse, the Salar de Uyuni, in Bolivia, a landlocked country where the government of its first indigenous president, Evo Morales, hasn\u2019t yet sealed a lithium-extraction deal and has gained a reputation for reneging on contracts.\u000a\u000aNow, a lithium shortage is forecast for 2015, the year by when India\u2019s auto sales are set to double.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe consumers are ready, the technology is better than ever,\u201d said a senior executive at another car major, refusing to be quoted so as not to \u201cdemoralize\u201d company engineers priming an electric-car for launch this week. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think India is ready.\u201d

a((VIndia must not sign the Copenhagen Accord on fighting climate change because it is "iniquitous" and "inefficient", says a leading green NGO, but the environment minister says the country should not be "evangelical".\u000a\u000a"The Copenhagen Accord is weak, meaningless and fundamentally flawed," Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Director Sunita Narain said here Friday. "It will be bad for the fight against climate change and bad for India."\u000a\u000aBut Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh pointed out that India had been closely involved in negotiating the accord. He has said earlier that India will sign it.\u000a\u000aWhile the minister held that the accord had "settled many contentious points" between countries on how to fight climate change without giving up on development, Narain said: "It allows developed countries to increase (greenhouse gas) emissions... It does not set drastic emission reduction targets for these countries.\u000a\u000a"If this accord is accepted, the world will not be able to meet the target of keeping global temperature rise within two degrees Celsius. It will be on course to at least three degrees and more - which will be disastrous for India's and the world's poorest and most vulnerable."\u000a\u000aThe Indian government has to decide this month if it will sign the Copenhagen Accord that was negotiated at the last moment during the Dec 7-18 climate summit in the Danish capital. India, along with China, Brazil, South Africa and the US, prepared the template of the accord.\u000a\u000aAustralia, Canada, Papua New Guinea and Maldives are the countries that have signed the accord so far. The deadline is Jan 31.\u000a\u000aRecounting how the accord was reached at Copenhagen, Ramesh said at an interaction organised by the Aspen Institute of India that it was "floundering on three issues: whether the goal of arresting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 should be expressed in terms of temperature or emission reduction or concentration of GHG in the atmosphere; what would be the international monitoring and verification regime for the mitigation actions of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) countries; and whether the accord would be legally binding".\u000a\u000a"We got 2.5 out of three," claimed the minister who was closely involved in the last-minute negotiations. "If you're evangelical you can never negotiate."\u000a\u000aBut Narain pointed out that the accord "legitimises inaction by industrialised countries and shifts the burden of the transition (to a low carbon economy) to developing countries. In this way, it rejects the principle of historical responsibility and equitable burden sharing, emphasised by the prime minister".\u000a\u000a"The Copenhagen Accord is an accord to give the right to pollute to the biggest and most powerful," she charged, and added: "India must ask for its right to development."\u000a\u000aThe CSE chief quoted from a leaked paper of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat to say current GHG emission mitigation pledges amounted to reduction of 2.1 gigatons (gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by rich countries and 5.2 gt by developing countries.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide is the main GHG causing climate change, which is already affecting farm output, making droughts, floods and storms more frequent and more severe, and raising the sea level. India is among the world's most vulnerable countries.\u000a\u000aTalking about the 1,201 gt cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from 1890 to 2007, Narain quoted a study by the International Energy Agency to point out that rich countries had emitted 58-60 percent of it (with the US alone accounting for 28-30 percent), while India had emitted three percent.\u000a\u000aUnder the Copenhagen Accord, she said, the US would be able to emit six gt of GHG in 2020, while India would be allowed to emit 3.6 gt. "The US has 4.5 percent of the world's population, India has 17 percent. To agree to this, we have to be either the world's most efficient country or the world's most criminally poor country."

Environment and Forest Minister Jairam Ramesh had though termed the "findings" as alarmist.\u000a\u000aIPCC chief R.K.

Husnain is now a distinguished fellow with The Energy and Resources Institute, a body headed by the IPCC chief.\u000a\u000aThe issue was being reviewed and a statement would be issued this week, he said. The claim would be deleted from the IPCC report, a UN official told HT on condition of anonymity.

Husnain, unavailable for comments since Sunday, however, failed to make public his wrong assertion.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlaciers will not disappear by 2035.

a((VLike an avalanche, the groundswell of scepticism regarding the melting of Himalayan glaciers threatens to demolish conventional wisdom to the contrary. To be sure, the deadline of 2035 by which these glaciers would be severely threatened has now been proved wrong. It could be a typographical error, as the Russian scientist whose paper has been used mentioned 2305. Or it could have been licence on the part of some scientists, WWF-India and journalists, who recycled this error.\u000a\u000aThe mistake ought to have been spotted by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which reiterated it in its 2007 assessment report without verification. The section on glaciers was compiled by a team, not a single author, which should have put in place the customary checks, including peer review. It is conceivable that since WWF-India cited it, the IPCC gave it more credence than it deserved. While the credibility of the IPCC has been eroded to an extent, it should not be erased by this slip.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, the IPCC comprises the research of some 2,500 scientists from around the world, who cannot have vested interests on specific issues. If anything, it has always been accused of erring on the side of caution and stating ranges of temperatures and forecasts, rather than specifics. Climate science, by its nature, is extremely complex and that concerning glaciers even more so, particularly in the Himalayas, where researchers have only recently been conducting studies with sophisticated equipment. The IPCC makes no policy prescriptions whatsoever.\u000a\u000aIf one sees the sequence of events, it does appear that vested interests \u2014 using British media \u2014 are seeking to discredit the IPCC. They first sought to tarnish R.K. Pachauri\u2019s reputation by alleging that he was corrupt in accepting fees from a number of institutions. The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) has shown how all these fees, which it listed, were paid directly to Teri, and not to him. The media even questioned his supposedly lavish lifestyle, which the clarification regarding fees demolishes. The Centre for Public Integrity reports that 770 companies and interest groups have hired 2,340 lobbyists to influence the US government\u2019s climate policies in recent months. In Britain, Christopher Monckton has led climate skeptics who have been targeting Pachauri, even at Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aThe most recent allegation by the British media \u2014 about Teri profiting from the IPCC\u2019s erroneous claims about Himalayan glaciers by obtaining grants to research this issue from the EU and Carnegie Corporation \u2014 only heightens the suspicion that a smear campaign is being launched to undermine Pachauri, and ultimately the IPCC, as the most authoritative source of scientific knowledge on climate change. While the IPCC has got the 2035 date wrong and may be challenged on other facts, no one has been able to question its broad assessment: that global temperatures are rising inexorably. Last week, Nasa reported how the last decade has been the warmest in recorded history.\u000a\u000aSince temperatures are rising, it is obvious that glaciers will melt. But scientists are wary about public pronouncements, while lobbyists have no such inhibitions. If the smear campaign succeeds in scuttling UN protocols to obtain funding for developing countries to cope with climate change, it\u2019ll be a huge tragedy.\u000a\u000aDarryl D\u2019Monte is Chairperson, Forum of Environmental Journalists of India (FEJI)\u000a\u000aThe views expressed by the author are personal

The website now states that glaciers around the world are in poor health.\u000a\u000aThe UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had retracted its prediction that most Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.\u000a\u000a\u201cMountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on average in all hemispheres, and may disappear altogether in certain regions of the world such as Himalayas, by 2030,\u201d the NASA webpage had said.\u000a\u000aFrom where NASA got the 2030 date is surprising.\u000a\u000aThe premier US space agency said its wrong assertion was from the IPCC\u2019s fourth assessment report and summary for policymakers.\u000a\u000aHT did not find any reference to 2030 with regard to Himalayan glaciers in the policy document of the IPCC released in 2007. \u201cNo date of melting of Himalayan glaciers was mentioned,\u201d said former environment secretary Pradipto Ghosh.\u000a\u000aThe policy document had referred to the year 2030 with regard to sea level rise and its impact but not about Himalayan glaciers. \u201cBy 2030, beach erosion and inundation of shoreline properties is likely to be a real problem...,\u201d it said about India.\u000a\u000aNASA was quick to correct its mistake. \u201cGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world \u2014 the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Alaska and Africa,\u201d said the NASA website this week with reference to Himalayan glaciers.\u000a\u000aInstead of the IPCC, NASA referred to the findings of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, a body of glaciologists.

a((VThe United States has formally affiliated with the Copenhagen Accord and pledged to cut its carbon emissions "in the range of 17 per cent" from 2005 levels, conditional on Congressional action on climate legislation.\u000a\u000aIn a letter to the UN Framework Conventional of Climate Change Secretariat on Thursday, chief US negotiator Todd Stern said the "pathway" in that pending legislation would cut US emissions 30 percent by 2025, 42 per cent by 2030, and 83 per cent by 2050.\u000a\u000aThose are the levels President Barack Obama offered in a deal with China, India, South Africa, Brazil - known as the BASIC Group - at the Copenhagen climate conference held last month. While achieving the levels needs Congressional action, the accord itself does not.\u000a\u000aStern wrote, "The US submission reflects President Obama's continued commitment to meeting the climate change and clean energy challenge through robust domestic and international action that will strengthen our economy, enhance our national security and protect our environment."\u000a\u000aStern said the US is affiliating under the assumption that other industrialised nations and large emerging economies will follow through with the deal reached Dec 19 at Copenhagen and also affiliate.\u000a\u000a"We expect that all major economies will honour their agreement in Copenhagen to submit their mitigation targets or actions," he said.\u000a\u000aThe summit had asked nations to report by Jan 31 whether they would associate themselves with the accord and join efforts to draft a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, whose legal obligations run out at the end of 2012.\u000a\u000aAfter a meeting in New Delhi on Jan 24 BASIC environment ministers said they would respect the deadline to submit plans for 2020 emissions and challenged donors to deliver on aid promises.\u000a\u000aThe United States is the only major industrialised nation to shun the Kyoto Protocol. Former president George W Bush argued that it was too costly and unfair even as it made no demands of fast-growing emerging economies such as China and India.\u000a\u000aThe US submission came hours after Obama made his first State of the Union address, where he urged a joint session of Congress to move ahead on climate legislation. The Senate has yet to vote on climate legislation, which squeaked through the House of Representatives in June.\u000a\u000aIn the State of the Union address, Obama did not specifically ask the Senate to approve the House vision of a "cap-and-trade" system-in which companies must curb emissions and have an economic incentive by trading credits.\u000a\u000a

a((VIn 1985, a hydrology professor was handed over a project to look into the glaciers of Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. His research paper was published in international journals. And thus began the career of one of India\u2019s most well known glaciologists, who was awarded the Padmashree in 2009.\u000a\u000aBorn in Muzzafarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Syed Iqbal Hasnain has often been considered as Mr Dial-a-Quote on the subject of the Himalayan glacier. He was one of the few people outside the government system who could talk about glaciers. The reputation got a jolt when the London-based newspaper The Sunday Times reported that in an interview to the magazine New Scientist in 1999, Hasnain had claimed that most of the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. And now with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) having picked up this figure, Hasnain can\u2019t wait to clear his name.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was misquoted,\u201d says the former professor from JNU. \u201cHow can I predict the demise of the Himalayan glaciers? I merely gave an approximation that in the next 40 to 50 years, many of the glaciers would melt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHasnain\u2019s claims have often kept him in the news. One of the first things that he\u2019d ever declared was that the Gangotri glacier, the source of the Ganga, was melting at a faster rate (up to 30 metres a year) because of pilgrim pressure and global warming. Then, a decade ago, he attributed the phenomenon, to black carbon \u2014 emission from kerosene stoves and burning of diesel burning. And now there\u2019s this.\u000a\u000aMountaineer Karanjeet Singh whose father Sarbjeet Singh had campaigned against Hasnain\u2019s claims, calls the professor an alarmist. \u201cMy father trekked on many of the glaciers that Hasnain has talked about. He found that neither the pilgrims nor heavy cooking stoves were causing the glaciers to melt. The idea was simply a figment of his imagination, there is no scientific research to back his claim.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn fact, in 2009 the environment ministry contradicted his claim, by reporting that the Gangotri glacier has been melting at a rate of 16 meters a year and the retreat has slowed down in the last two decades.\u000a\u000aNow, a senior fellow with Delhi\u2019s The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which is headed by RK Pachauri of IPCC, Hasnain insists that his research was based on sound international scientific standards and put forth a list of 38 research papers he\u2019s published. He believes that he is \u201crealistic rather than an alarmist\u201d, and feels that the work he has done over the last quarter of a century is now under scrutiny. \u201cFor the last 25 years, I have tried to tell people about the real state of affairs of our glaciers, but nobody really wants to listen to me.\u201d It was trouble when a lot of people did.

a((VTo understand the perils and the multi-billion dollar promises of living in the age of climate change, start amid the bus-high piles of garbage in a municipal compost plant in the south Delhi suburb of Okhla.\u000a\u000aEgrets and crows dodge backhoes that rake the rotten vegetables, plastic, paper and glass into romantically named \u201cwindrows\u201d, what the piles of garbage are called. Over six to eight weeks, after some spraying, sieving and packing, the garbage is turned into a fine-grained fertilizer and trucked out to farmers in northern India. Tough questions\u000a\u000aTurning garbage into compost is a fine idea, except there\u2019s no money in it. At Okhla, the sale of fertilizer covers only 60 per cent of costs.\u000a\u000aSo why is one of India\u2019s leading infrastructure and finance companies, through a subsidiary called IL&FS Ecosmart, wading into Delhi\u2019s unprofitable garbage? Why has it started 17 such operations across India in the last 24 months?\u000a\u000aThe answer lies in Germany, where executives at its second-largest electricity producer, RWE AG, are keen the Okhla project works, so they can keep their giant coal-fired power plants running.\u000a\u000aThe Okhla business model sounds easy. Make fertilizer from garbage. Save the earth from a greenhouse gas (and clean up Delhi as well). The composting prevents the emission of methane, one of the gases responsible for warming the globe. For every tonne of greenhouse gas India can keep out of the air, there\u2019s $10 (Rs 470) to be made.\u000a\u000aNow, sell the value of the eliminated methane to the Germans.\u000a\u000aIL&FS\u2019s Okhla plant and hundreds of diverse operations across India are at the heart of global climate-change negotiations, as they release enough clean air to create what has already become India\u2019s fastest-growing industry: the carbon trade.\u000a\u000aThe actual sale of what are called carbon credits is more complicated. Two years after it started, the Okhla operation hasn\u2019t got a dollar \u2014 and if a critical meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, fails in December, the future of IL&FS\u2019s project is in doubt.\u000a\u000aTHE HEAT IS HERE\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been nearly twenty years since international leaders accepted that earth\u2019s temperature is on the rise, and that human industrial activity is to blame.\u000a\u000aNew projections by leading researchers show climate change will affect every aspect of modern life. Agricultural production will plunge as erratic weather shifts sowing seasons and monsoon rains. The melting of Himalayan glaciers \u2014 which many say is already taking place at double the rate elsewhere \u2014 will lead to challenges in water supply. Rising sea levels, brought about by glacier melt, could submerge islands and coastal towns.\u000a\u000aIn India, where flood and drought already affect more than 400 million people, the results could be catastrophic. Close to 68 per cent of India\u2019s land is vulnerable to drought. A third of India\u2019s great plains are vulnerable to floods, which account for 50 per cent of our natural disasters. The cost of floods and droughts is as high as\u000a\u000aRs 15,600 crore over five years, according to the Planning Commission\u2019s 11th five-year plan. This money is enough to provide free food to a third of India\u2019s 300 million poor for a year.\u000a\u000aIndian policymakers have said for years that rich nations created global warming by burning fossil fuels to fire industrialisation. Even now, although India is the world\u2019s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, its per capita emissions are just over 1/20th that of the US (see graphics).\u000a\u000aThe first National Action Plan on Climate Change, issued in 2008, says that any international agreement on climate change must \u201callow each inhabitant of the earth an equal entitlement to the global atmospheric resource\u201d. India has maintained that line in international negotiations, insisting that rich nations pay up, and that India won\u2019t accept binding cuts on its greenhouse gas emissions because the cuts might limit economic growth.\u000a\u000aIn recent months, environment minister Jairam Ramesh has suggested a change. In an October note to the prime minister, Ramesh proposed domestic emissions cuts. Pradipto Ghosh, a former environment secretary and India\u2019s lead climate-change negotiator, says he sees \u201cnothing wrong in discussing these issues\u201d. To take Ramesh\u2019s debate forward, the prime minister has called a meeting of the National Development Council, a body of all state chief ministers, before the Copenhagen conference in December.\u000a\u000aMuch of the recent talk about international negotiation focuses on \u201cco-benefits\u201d, or measures that India would want to implement for its own reasons, and not just because of international pressure. Some of these measures \u2014 increasing the efficiency of power plants, investing in public transport \u2014 carry costs, but they are opportunities.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe should tell the world that we are serious about climate change,\u201d says R.K. Pachauri, head of the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u000a\u000aAlready, India is considering mandating more efficiency in the electricity and automobile sectors, a move that might open up a domestic market for carbon credits. Many businesses are ready to go green.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t see much problem in adopting fuel efficiency standards by 2011,\u201d says Dilip Chenoy, director with Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\u000a\u000aMONEY FOR AIR\u000a\u000aBut to truly understand the impact of climate change on economic growth requires a return to Okhla, New Delhi, where a compost plant that started operations in 2007 has not yet made money.\u000a\u000aThe operators of the Okhla plant have a twin revenue model. They sell their compost for\u000a\u000aRs 1,200-2,000 per bag, but they also sell clean air, free of methane gas.\u000a\u000aUnder a 1997 international agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol, developed nations like Germany and the United Kingdom must limit their greenhouse gas emissions to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.\u000a\u000aBut governments and corporations that have trouble meeting this target can buy carbon credits, or Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), from carbon-reduction projects in developing countries like India and China.\u000a\u000aThe Kyoto Protocol aims to create a barter system, known as the Clean Development Mechanism or CDM, where rich nations can pay for the adoption of new, greener technologies in the developing world.\u000a\u000aThe operators of the Okhla compost plant will keep about 300,000 tonnes of methane from being released into the atmosphere between the years 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000aIL&FS won\u2019t say exactly how much it\u2019s getting for each carbon credit, but each is worth roughly $10 (Rs 470) in the international market. Before they can start making carbon money this month, the project must be registered with the Indian government and the United Nations, and validated by a team of Norwegian regulators, a two-year approval process.\u000a\u000aSince 2005, the year the Kyoto Protocol came into effect, India\u2019s carbon market has shot from 0 to $5 billion (Rs 23,500 crore) annually, an increase of many hundreds of times. The closest comparison is the telecommunications market, which grew by 1,000 per cent, or 10 times, over the same period.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is the fastest growing market,\u201d says Ashutosh Pandey, CEO of carbon consultancy firm Emergent Ventures. \u201cIt will become the largest market in the world, and it impacts everybody in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPandey\u2019s company has a portfolio of more than 200 projects, mostly in India. Like an increasing number of Indians, they have turned the costs of global warming into business opportunity.\u000a\u000aIndia has registered 456 CDM projects with the United Nations, more than any other country except China. The projects are expected to generate 233 million tonnes of carbon reductions by 2012, according to carbon ratings agency IDEAcarbon.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s carbon market includes major players like the Delhi Metro, which cuts carbon dioxide from the air by reducing the amount of fossil fuels burned by cars, to small-scale initiatives like the introduction of more efficient stoves in rural households.\u000a\u000aFor firms like IL&FS Ecosmart, the CDM system has enabled projects that would otherwise not make financial sense.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese projects are not cash generating from day one,\u201d says Ecosmart\u2019s CEO Mahesh Babu. \u201cWithout CDM, they are not viable.\u201d\u000a\u000aCOPENHAGEN CALLING\u000a\u000aThe future of India\u2019s carbon economy now depends on whether negotiators can agree on what to do about climate change after 2012, the year the Kyoto Protocol expires.\u000a\u000aThe debate hinges on the United States, the world\u2019s second largest greenhouse gas emitter and the seventh largest per capita emitter. The US signed the Kyoto Protocol but never ratified it, which means it doesn\u2019t have to cut emissions, and it can\u2019t buy carbon credits.\u000a\u000aThat may change.\u000a\u000aA bill currently being considered by the United States Congress would require emissions reductions of 20 per cent over 2005 levels, and encourage the trading of carbon credits.\u000a\u000aThe US can enter the carbon market only if some deal is worked out at Copenhagen, says Alessandro Vitelli, director of Strategy and Intelligence at IDEAcarbon.\u000a\u000aDespite its unknown future, in some ways, CDM might have already succeeded in creating a greener business environment in India.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur cement industry is the cleanest and our steel sector is the most efficient in the world. In wind energy generation, India is ranked fifth,\u201d says Jamshed Godrej, past president of industry body Confederation of Indian Industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf somebody asks me what has been the single biggest success factor of CDM, I would say awareness of companies,\u201d says Pandey. \u201cThey know that climate change is occurring, they know that customer preferences and businesses will change, they know they have responsibility to create greener business, and I see this now in India.\u201d

Pachauri \u2014 had warned of the melting of glaciers, which would have far-reaching consequences for India. Now, evidence has emerged to suggest that the IPCC may have been mistaken.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are studying the new evidence,\u201d Pachauri.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC\u2019s claim was based on an article in the New Statesman, London, which relied on an estimate made by India\u2019s leading glaciologist and Padamshree recipient Syed Iqbal Hasnain.\u000a\u000aFred Pearce, who wrote the article, has told Sunday Times, London, that Hasnain, who made the claim in 1999, had said he would provide a report explaining his conclusion.\u000a\u000a\u201cI obtained a copy, and it did not have what Hasnain had said,\u201d Pearce told the newspaper. \u201cIt does not mention 2035 as a date by which Himalayan glaciers will melt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHasnain had told Pearce his claim was \u201cspeculative\u201d.\u000a\u000aAttempts by Hindustan Times to reach Hasnain failed. His family said he was away and there was no telephone number at which he could be contacted.\u000a\u000aProfessor Murari Lal, who oversaw the chapter on glaciers in the IPCC report, said the claim about the glaciers should be dropped. \u201cIf Hasnain says he never asserted this, or that it is a wrong presumption, I will recommend that the assertion about Himalayan glaciers be removed from future IPCC assessments,\u201d Lal said.\u000a\u000aPachauri said IPCC would issue a statement on the glaciers \u201cby the middle of this week\u201d.

And freezing weather is gripping the Deep South, including Florida's orange groves and beaches.\u000a\u000aWhatever happened to global warming?\u000a\u000aSuch weather doesn't seem to fit with warnings from scientists that the Earth is warming because of greenhouse gases. But experts say the cold snap doesn't disprove global warming at all - it's just a blip in the long-term heating trend.\u000a\u000a"It's part of natural variability," said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. With global warming, he said, "we'll still have record cold temperatures. We'll just have fewer of them."\u000a\u000aDeke Arndt of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., noted that 2009 will rank among the 10 warmest years for Earth since 1880.\u000a\u000aScientists say man-made climate change does have the potential to cause more frequent and more severe weather extremes, such as heat waves, storms, floods, droughts and even cold spells. But experts interviewed by The Associated Press did not connect the current frigid blast to climate change.\u000a\u000aSo what is going on?\u000a\u000a"We basically have seen just a big outbreak of Arctic air" over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere, Arndt said. "The Arctic air has really turned itself loose on us."\u000a\u000aIn the atmosphere, large rivers of air travel roughly west to east around the globe between the Arctic and the tropics. This air flow acts like a fence to keep Arctic air confined.\u000a\u000aBut recently, this air flow has become bent into a pronounced zigzag pattern, meandering north and south. If you live in a place where it brings air up from the south, you get warm weather. In fact, record highs were reported this week in Washington state and Alaska.\u000a\u000aBut in the eastern United States, like some other unlucky parts of the globe, Arctic air is swooping down from the north. And that's how you get a temperature of 3 degrees in Beijing, a reading of minus-42 in mainland Norway, and 18 inches of snow in parts of Britain, where a member of Parliament who said the snow "clearly indicates a cooling trend" was jeered by colleagues.\u000a\u000aThe zigzag pattern arises naturally from time to time, but it is not clear why it's so strong right now, said Michelle L'Heureux, a meteorologist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The center says the pattern should begin to weaken in a week or two.\u000a\u000aJeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said he expects more typical winter weather across North America early next week.\u000a\u000aThat will be welcome news in the South, where farmers have been trying to salvage millions of dollars' worth of strawberries and other crops.\u000a\u000aOn Miami Beach, tourists bundled up in woolen winter coats and hooded sweatshirts Wednesday beneath a clear blue sky. Some brazenly let the water wash over their feet and a few even lay out in bikinis and swimming trunks. A brisk wind blew and temperatures hovered in the 50s.\u000a\u000a"Last year we were swimming every day," said Olivia Ruedinger of Hamburg, Germany. "I miss that."\u000a\u000aRaphael Satter in London, Cara Anna in Beijing, and Christine Armario in Miami contributed to this report.\u000a\u000a

It also pledges $30 billion (Rs1.4 trillion) between 2010 and 2012 and $100 billion a year by 2020 for developing countries to help adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe agreement has been criticized by environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and carbon traders including Barclays Capital as it didn\u2019t set binding targets. While countries including the US, China and India agreed on 19 December to take note of the agreement, they were given until 31 January to list actions and targets.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh said on 22 December a statement by the White House senior adviser David Axelrod that the US can challenge India and China if they don\u2019t meet the goals is spin meant for domestic consumption.\u000a\u000aChina, the world\u2019s largest polluter, acted as a responsible nation at the talks last month and doesn\u2019t merit subsequent criticism, the country\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a shift to renewable sources of energy and India must take the lead in the development of science and technology related to mitigation and adaptation of climate change,\u201d Singh said.\u000a\u000aIndia needs to increase its solar and nuclear supplies considerably, he said.

a((VUpdated: Mon, Jan 11 2010. 09 25 PM IST\u000a\u000aIn the run-up to last month\u2019s climate change summit at Copenhagen, there were many invitations to physical and electronic forums to discuss \u201cgreen jobs\u201d\u2014that is, those jobs that either pass the test of not harming the environment or focus on green technologies. While this concept may be relevant in rich countries, environmentalists are knocking on an already open door in India: 95% of our working age population lives off agriculture, in rural areas, or suffers poverty\u2014the greenest jobs in the world. So this is one global ranking that we undisputedly top.\u000a\u000aPhoto: Madhu Kapparath / Mint But this ranking is shameful for many reasons. First, because a job in our low-productivity agriculture is often a ticket to poverty\u2014the reason 65% of our population produces 18% of our output. Second, because informal employment is the slavery of the 21st century\u201493% of our labour force works in the unorganized sector. Third, because job creation clusters are missing\u2014200,000 of our 600,000 villages have fewer than 200 people. Fourth, because 40% of our labour force is low-productivity working poor\u2014they make enough money to live but not enough to pull out of poverty. Fifth, because our rotten 3E (education, employability and employment) regime means that the most important decision a child makes in India today is to choose his or her parents wisely.\u000a\u000aI believe that people who care for the environment are making a Faustian bargain by aligning with trade unions, the left chatterati and anti-free market types. While there seems to be a short-term alignment among these ideological types arising from a perceived shared opponent\u2014markets and business\u2014such associations undermine long-term legitimacy and soft power. That\u2019s because the best odds for saving our environment lie in finding regulated market solutions for poverty, energy and transportation.\u000a\u000aTrade unions\u2014always quick to position their own self-interest as the greater good\u2014are reacting predictably. They released a report just before Copenhagen entitled, Green growth for jobs and social justice. Prepared by a global association of unions, this report is not only self-serving because it \u201cstrives to put social justice on the climate change agenda\u201d but also patronizing because it advocates \u201cfinding a new development model for poor countries\u201d.\u000a\u000aGreen jobs are a child of the \u201cgood growth\u201d concept propagated by well-meaning folks who believe poor countries do not need to make trade-offs between growth and the environment. While this positioning of \u201cgreen\u201d as the ultimate free ride is intellectually and spiritually appealing, I\u2019m in the camp of Ronald Reagan, who once said, \u201cYou can have everything you want. You just can\u2019t have it all at the same time\u201d. Today, there are clear, real and high costs of going green. These parallel lines only meet when technology creates viable, sustainable and scalable alternatives that make the green environment trade-off superfluous for poor countries. But we are not there today and it is dangerous, discriminatory and dishonest to insist that we are.\u000a\u000aThe last few years have confirmed that we don\u2019t have to be Western to be modern. But moral pressure around green jobs or good growth only reverts to old biases in the game that favour developed countries. Copenhagen disappointed because, right or wrong, the fairness gene in our heads\u2014and the burden of history and hope\u2014will sabotage anything that either raises the development bar for poor countries or doesn\u2019t involve the rich countries undoing their carbon debits.\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen initial offer made by rich countries to help poor countries for $10 billion per year for three years is a joke. And given rich countries\u2019 fiscal positions and demographics, their collective vow to mobilize $100 billion by 2020 for adaptation and mitigation programmes deserves Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s quip to the 1942 offer made by Stafford Cripps of guaranteeing India\u2019s independence after World War II\u2014a \u201cpost-dated cheque on a failing bank\u201d.\u000a\u000aIndia must get its sequencing right and currently focus only on creating jobs and equality of opportunity. Nuances to economic development and industrialization are only acceptable after we hit certain per capita income, health and education thresholds. Growth before good growth. Food for stomach before food for thought. Thresholds before limits.\u000a\u000aIndia needs to reform labour laws, skill its youth, and fix its education system so it can get people off farms, explode manufacturing, increase urbanization and expand organized employment. And, thereby, eradicate green jobs and poverty.\u000a\u000aManish Sabharwal is chairman, Teamlease Services. Comment at theirview@livemint.com

But these nations have refused, blaming the industrialized world for historically high carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Manmohan Singh is unhappy about repeated calls from UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen to accede to the 31 January deadline for target submission, officials at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said.\u000a\u000aBan and Rasmussen had written to Singh, urging him to meet the deadline.\u000a\u000aSingh has also questioned the legal status of certain provisions of last month\u2019s Copenhagen Accord. \u201cBefore going ahead with targets submission, the Prime Minister wants to be clarified on certain issues on which Ban\u2019s letter is silent,\u201d officials added.\u000a\u000aSpeaking after their meeting in New Delhi, BASIC ministers tried to realign themselves with the Group of 77 (G-77) developing countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no formal group called BASIC.

The underlying assumptions may not have been derived by the scaremongering of the Al Gore type, but the conclusions of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had a big role to play. Now, with IPCC\u2019s conclusions coming under a growing cloud of doubt, it is worth asking if India needs to kick off a new debate on what to do at future climate change talks.\u000a\u000aIPCC\u2019s claims came close to making India rethink industrialization and economic growth. Claims that climate change would be irreversible if global temperature rose to 2 degrees Celsius above their level before the Industrial Revolution fuelled a global frenzy to \u201cdo something\u201d.\u000a\u000aNot everything IPCC has said may be wrong. The problem was the way its reports were used to put pressure on India to score a self-goal.\u000a\u000aAll this became evident in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference. The circus started somewhat like this. A year or so before the conference, non-governmental organizations (read friends of the poor) began arguing about the destructive effects of climate change on the lives of the poor. The cue was then picked up by, ironically, leaders of the rich countries who then began exerting pressure on India and China, home to a huge number of poor, to agree to binding emission cuts. With just months to go, Indian and Chinese leaders, visibly under pressure, started making noises about non-binding national strategies for climate change mitigation. So what began as an effort to help save the poor from ecological Armageddon ended up as an effort to preserve the lifestyles of the rich and the powerful.\u000a\u000aSince the end of the Cold War, this is perhaps the first occasion when scientific work has been used for strategic ends on such a scale, openly and without any qualms.\u000a\u000aMost policymaking efforts in the developing world are handicapped by the absence of meaningful analysis backed by scientific evidence. Poor countries lack the resources to do so. That is one reason for bad policies and waste of human resources. The lasting damage from this episode will be that policymakers will be forced to think of the strategic aspects of scientific advice.\u000a\u000aShould policymakers trust the science behind climate change?

Most see the contents as demonstrating some arbitrary manipulating of various climate data sources in order to fit preconceived hypotheses (true), or as stonewalling and requesting colleagues to destroy emails to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But there\u2019s something much, much worse going on\u2014a silencing of climate scientists, akin to filtering what goes in the Bible, that will have consequences for public policy.\u000a\u000aThe Bible I\u2019m referring to, of course, is the refereed scientific literature. It\u2019s our canon, and it\u2019s all we have really had to go on in climate science (until the Internet has so rudely interrupted). When scientists make putative compendia of that literature, such as is done by the UN climate change panel every six years, the writers assume that the peer-reviewed literature is a true and unbiased sample of the state of climate science. That can no longer be the case.\u000a\u000aA refereed journal, Climate Research, published two particular papers that offended Michael Mann of Penn State and Tom Wigley of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. One of the papers, published in 2003 by Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas (of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), was a meta-analysis of dozens of \u201cpaleoclimate\u201d studies that extended back 1,000 years. They concluded that 20th century temperatures could not confidently be considered to be warmer than those indicated at the beginning of the last millennium.\u000a\u000aIn fact, that period, known as the \u201cMedieval Warm Period\u201d, was generally considered warmer than the 20th century in climate textbooks and climate compendia, including those in the 1990s from IPCC. Then, in 1999, Mann published his famous \u201chockey stick\u201d article in Geophysical Research Letters (GRL), which, through the magic of multivariate statistics and questionable data weighting, wiped out both the Medieval Warm Period and the subsequent \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d (a cold period from late 16th century to mid-19th century), leaving only the 20th century warming as an anomaly of note.\u000a\u000aMann and Wigley also didn\u2019t like a paper I published in Climate Research in 2002. It said human activity was warming surface temperatures, and that this was consistent with the mathematical form (but not the size) of projections from computer models. Why? The magnitude of the warming in CRU\u2019s own data was not as great as in the models, so therefore the models merely were a bit enthusiastic about the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aMann called upon his colleagues to try and put Climate Research out of business. \u201cPerhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal,\u201d he wrote in one of the emails. \u201cWe would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter CRU\u2019s Phil Jones and Mann threatened a boycott of publications and reviews, half the editorial board of Climate Research resigned. People who didn\u2019t toe Wigley, Mann and Jones\u2019 line began to experience increasing difficulty in publishing their results. This happened to me and to the University of Alabama\u2019s Roy Spencer, who also hypothesized that global warming is likely to be modest. Others surely stopped trying, tiring of summary rejections of good work by editors scared of the mob.\u000a\u000aGRL is a very popular refereed journal. Wigley was concerned that one of the editors was \u201cin the sceptics camp\u201d. He emailed Mann to say that \u201cif we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official...channels to get him ousted.\u201d Mann wrote to Wigley on 20 November 2005 that \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to lose Climate Research. We can\u2019t afford to lose GRL.\u201d In this context, \u201closing\u201d obviously means the publication of anything that they did not approve of on global warming. Soon the suspect editor, Yale\u2019s James Saiers, was gone. Mann wrote to Jones that \u201cthe GRL leak may have been plugged up now w/ new editorial leadership there.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt didn\u2019t stop there. Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory complained that the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS) was now requiring authors to provide actual copies of the actual data that was used in published papers. He wrote to Jones on 19 March that \u201cIf the RMS is going to require authors to make ALL data available\u2014raw data PLUS results from all intermediate calculations\u2014I will not submit any further papers to RMS journals.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe result of all this is that our refereed literature has been inestimably damaged, and reputations have been trashed. Wigley repeatedly tells news reporters not to listen to \u201csceptics\u201d (or even nonsceptics such as me), because they didn\u2019t publish enough in the peer-reviewed literature\u2014even as he and his friends sought to make it difficult or impossible to do so.\u000a\u000aIronically, with the release of the Climategate emails, the Climatic Research Unit, Michael Mann, Phil Jones and Tom Wigley have dramatically weakened the case for emission reductions.\u000a\u000aTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL\u000a\u000aPatrick J Michaels is a former professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and currently a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington, DC.\u000a\u000aEdited excerpts.

Cold fusion, viral epidemic scares and miracle cures are good examples. Now climate change has joined the list. In the days leading to the Copenhagen climate change summit, much had been made of the claim that Himalayan glaciers could witness a complete meltdown by 2035. It added to the excitement in a cold Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aIt appears that the claim had no scientific backing. It began with the publication of a story in the popular science journal, New Scientist, in 1999, years before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report in 2007. The New Scientist report was based on a telephone interview with an Indian scientist, Syed Hasnain. These claims were not the result of scientific observation or analysis of data. To make matters worse, the New Scientist report was used in transmitting these ideas further. The Times, a British newspaper, has reported that this thread was picked up by a conservation advocacy organization, WWF, in a 2005 report. That was in turn used as an input by IPCC on making claims on a glacial meltdown.\u000a\u000aAll this is in marked contrast to what policymakers and other experts have said. In India, environment minister Jairam Ramesh denied this link (\u201cNo evidence to link global warming and Himalayan glaciers: minister\u201d, Mint, 9 November). The need for a careful examination of data and more observation of these glacial systems has also been highlighted by Michele Koppes, a glaciologist from the University of British Columbia (\u201cThe shrinking Third Pole\u201d, Mint, 7 December).\u000a\u000aThis is not the first controversy on the subject. Late last year, emails leaked from the climate research unit at the University of East Anglia in England showed the disdain that scientists believing in climate change had for those against such arguments. There were allegations that contrarian data on climate change had been suppressed.\u000a\u000aScientific data and opinion that have a bearing on policies which affect millions of people often get embroiled in controversies. At times the stakes are so high that the search for scientific truth is sometimes left behind and scientists get enmeshed in political agendas. This is unfortunate, more so because the consequences of the debates and policy actions are likely to be momentous.\u000a\u000aHas the science behind climate change been weakened?

But he said that there had been a benefit in that it created a heightened awareness about the real threat to Himalayan glaciers.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC co-won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for bringing climate change to the world\u2019s attention.\u000a\u000aThe glacier error came to light after four prominent glaciologists and hydrologists wrote a letter to the prestigious US journal Science.\u000a\u000aThey said that the paragraph\u2019s mistakes stemmed from a report by the conservation group WWF.\u000a\u000aWWF had picked up a news report based on an unpublished study, compounded by the accidental inversion of a date\u20142035 instead of 2350\u2014in a Russian paper published in 1996.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC came under ferocious attack from climate sceptics ahead of the UN conference in Copenhagen in December.\u000a\u000aBut Pachauri has defended the panel\u2019s overall work, a position shared by other scientists, who say that the core conclusions about climate change are incontrovertible.

We have to be prepared for some big changes.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here to view a slideshow on 2010: Alan Weisman on climate change challenges.\u000a\u000a\u201cI climbed Cotopaxi with an Ecuadorian mountaineer who\u2019d been up the mountain six months earlier. He was amazed when we reached the glacier at a little over 4,500m. We had to climb 100m higher than he did last time to reach it\u2014an indication that the glacier was shrinking. This isn\u2019t just a beautiful ice cap on the top of a stirring mountain\u2026it\u2019s the source of water to all the area\u2019s farmers. In the case of Kilimanjaro, Kenya and Tanzania depend on rain in the spring and the fall\u2026the rest of the year they depend on springs fed by glacier water. They\u2019re having problems now because of turbulence in the climate. Sometimes, the fall rains aren\u2019t coming. Sometimes, the spring rains come way too much and they get flooding, and the source of water during the rest of the year\u2026is diminishing. If this disappears, it\u2019s going to be an enormous problem.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been to some South Pacific atolls where people live on islands that are at variable sea level. Their crops are dependent on limited fresh water, which is being endangered. If sea levels keep rising\u2026their islands are going to get swamped. Even before that, the pressure of a rising sea will allow seawater to start invading the water table. You\u2019re going to get saltier and saltier water, and it\u2019ll be harder to make a living that way. Bangladeshis have been living at or below sea level for a long time. They\u2019ve learnt various coping mechanisms\u2014they\u2019ve learnt to go up onto roof tops at certain times of the year. That isn\u2019t to say they don\u2019t have any problems. They\u2019re going to run out of their capacity to cope, because they\u2019re going to have to spend longer and longer waiting out floods to recede. After a while, it\u2019s going to be impossible to maintain a food or a fresh water supply.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWestern North America is arid compared to the eastern part. Moisture is dependent on snowfall\u2026in the mountains. The snow patch has been diminishing over the past couple of decades\u2014measurably. We also have\u2026vegetation that helps to retain water in the soil. There are massive forests and they\u2019re all coming down. The forests, as they get drier, become more susceptible to bark beetles, which live in the forest, but their lifespan is usually limited by cold winters. Now, because summers are longer, the beetles have time to generate more breeding cycles. The wood is drier and cannot produce bark resin, the natural defence against these insects. (The Canadian province of) British Columbia is predicted to lose 90% of its forest by 2015. You go to Alaska and northern Mexico and places in between, and you see enormous stretches of dead forest. We may be looking at a major disaster.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here for all Mint 2010 issue multimedia specials

a((VUpdated: Mon, Jan 25 2010. 11 09 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: The department of science and technology is framing a national data access and sharing policy that could change the way the government maintains and shares information, two government officials said.\u000a\u000aThe policy would compel departments and publicly funded bodies to scan their records, review the kind of data they maintain and release it for public consumption.\u000a\u000aOfficials involved with the initiative said that the move would, for the first time, create institutional systems to coax ministries into sharing as much information as possible, provided this does not pose a security risk.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the next few years, if a government department doesn\u2019t share information, it will have to give reasons why it isn\u2019t doing so,\u201d said one of the officials involved in framing the policy. \u201cIf it classifies some information as restricted, it will have to justify its stance. That\u2019s an inversion of current policy.\u201d Both the officials requested anonymity.\u000a\u000aCurrently, information collected by the government is marked \u201crestricted access\u201d, when it\u2019s often possible to get it off the Internet anyway, researchers say.\u000a\u000a\u201cTake Google Earth for instance,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe Survey of India has all that and much more. So it makes sense to release that, possibly allow other end-users to make better maps and maybe charge end-users a nominal fee.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe access and sharing policy is the brainchild of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who hinted at such a policy at the Indian Science Congress in Thiruvananthapuram earlier this month.\u000a\u000aScience minister Prithviraj Chavan had, on the sidelines of a conference on 18 January, said the first draft of the policy would be ready by May.\u000a\u000aAs of now, the top officials in all Central government departments have been consulted, though the departments of space and defence are yet to give their assent, said the official cited above.\u000a\u000aThe biggest beneficiaries are likely to be researchers and the geospatial industry.\u000a\u000aPrivate firms such as Google Inc. (in 2007) announced they would step up plans to map India by surveying down to the city and village block levels. The Indian geospatial research industry, pegged at Rs839 crore, is expected to treble by 2013, according to a 2008 industry report.\u000a\u000aThe policy will help standardize data, said Rajesh Kalra, managing director, Risk Management Services India Pvt. Ltd, which uses a variety of weather and geographical data to make commercial risk assessments.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven something as simple as an updated document on the actual number of villages in India is hard to find,\u201d Kalra said. \u201cWhen we approach ministries, they rarely have fixed rates for certain kinds of data. Better data helps us make better risk assessments.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe lack of India-specific data was one of the key weaknesses of trying to gauge the impact of climate change in the country, said N.H. Ravindranath, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve made several submissions to various ministries for hydrology data, soil carbon data, river flow,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this exists. For some reason, they are deemed classified. This (the policy) should be a welcome step.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost studies that have estimated India\u2019s greenhouse gas inventories, or the impact of climate change over India, have relied on so-called global circulation models prepared by research centres based out of the UK or the US, largely because of the unavailability of local research and data.\u000a\u000aOther experts see the benefits of the policy beyond map making.\u000a\u000aP. Banerjee, director of the National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies, a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research body, is confident of several interesting studies involving the Indian Institutes of Management and Indian Institutes of Technology if they release data.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere may be issues of privacy, but as long as you withhold names, I don\u2019t see why such data should be restricted in the first place,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHowever, government departments are unlikely to begin releasing data anytime soon as they need to work on getting their data interoperable. \u201cLots of interesting stuff is still in the files. Those that are digitized are not flexible across operating systems,\u201d said another science ministry official. \u201cThat will take a minimum of two years.\u201d

Ramesh Pathania/Mint\u000a\u000aUpdated: Mon, Jan 04 2010. 11 49 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: Twenty-four hours before the world\u2019s most-attended auto show began, actor Rahul Bose had decided his next car: a four-door Reva NXR made in Bangalore.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was just waiting for the four-door version, and now it\u2019s here,\u201d Bose, an avid, active spokesman for climate-change issues, said of the latest version of India\u2019s biggest selling electric car.\u000a\u000aGearing up: A Tata truck for display at the 10th edition of India\u2019s Auto Expo, which starts on Tuesday at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. Ramesh Pathania/Mint With pressure growing globally on the automobile industry to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, it\u2019s no coincidence that the 10th edition of India\u2019s Auto Expo will open on Tuesday with the biggest-ever showing of electric, hybrid and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles:\u000a\u000aA UK company will showcase the world\u2019s first hydrogen-fuelled, zero-emission motorcycle.\u000a\u000aToyota\u2014the world\u2019s largest auto maker\u2014will launch its petrol-electric hybrid Prius sedan.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s top auto companies (Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai Motor and Mahindra and Mahindra) will unveil electric vehicles.\u000a\u000aVehicles that do not use carbon-based fossil fuels, petrol or diesel, generate great enthusiasm in an age of rising carbon emission and global temperatures. They could attract crowds to rival the 1.8 million who turned out in 2008, where the Nano was the star attraction.\u000a\u000aAlso Read Uphill drive for electric cars\u000a\u000aBut the companies themselves admit a growing skepticism over next-gen vehicles.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur problem in India is electricity,\u201d said Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have electricity, and if your electricity anyway comes from coal, I am wondering, what objective that (electric vehicles) would meet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are also enthusiastic at Maruti Suzuki, and our engineers are very keen, but no one has given me a satisfactory answer to this question.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter decades of false starts, new technology is allowing electric cars (100,000 may be on India\u2019s roads by the end of the year, up from 85,000 now) to be driven farther than ever before at a running costone-third cheaper than conventional cousins.\u000a\u000aThe new Reva, for instance, has a claimed range of 160km. That compensates for the higher costs of electric cars: Typically Rs1 lakh or more than petrol- or diesel-driven vehicles.\u000a\u000aGetting set: Workers preparing displays for the 10th Auto Expo press conference at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi on Monday. Rajkraj/Hindustan Times But in this age of globalisation, two complex, long-term dilemmas face India: coal and Bolivia.\u000a\u000aOne, with at least 70% of the nation\u2019s electricity coming from coal-fired plants\u2014implicated in warming the planet\u2014tax breaks and other incentives to electric vehicles might actually further environmental damage.\u000a\u000aTwo, most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (tiny amounts are vital to power laptops and cellphones), but if lithium use explodes as it\u2019s projected to, the biggest hurdle comes from a barren, salt desert in the heart of South America.\u000a\u000aThe global market for automotive lithium batteries is forecast at $70 billion (Rs3.26 trillion) annually by 2020, dwarfing the the lithium market for cellphones and laptops, currently at $7 billion, according to Ener1, a leading Norwegian-US battery maker.\u000a\u000aIf that is to happen, someone will have to crack the Salar-de-Uyuni problem.\u000a\u000aMore than half the world\u2019s reserves of lithium, the lightest metal used by industry, come from the great salt expanse, the Salar de Uyuni, in Bolivia, a landlocked country where the government of its first indigenous president, Evo Morales, hasn\u2019t yet sealed a lithium-extraction deal and has gained a reputation for reneging on contracts.\u000a\u000aNow, a lithium shortage is forecast for 2015, the year by when India\u2019s auto sales are set to double.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe consumers are ready, the technology is better than ever,\u201dsaid a senior executive at another car major, refusing to be named so as not to \u201cdemoralize\u201d company engineers priming an electric car for launch this week.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I don\u2019t think India is ready.\u201d

McKibben was named one ofForeign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers in December, \u201cfor making global warming a people's cause\u201d.\u000a\u000aI published the first book for a general audience on global warming almost exactly two decades ago, so I\u2019ve been privileged to watch the development of the debate over the most important issue humans have ever faced. It\u2019s always been difficult. I remember one Harvard expert, way back in the 1980s, describing it as \u201cthe problem from hell\u201d because there were so many overlapping and opposed interests. Rich countries and poor, emerging and poor, oil-rich and coal-poor. That hellish knot was evident in Copenhagen\u2014it\u2019s the reason the talks ultimately failed.\u000a\u000aBut the most important thread of this story has always been the science. Without it, there would be no reason for this impassioned debate. So, it\u2019s worth recalling how that\u2019s changed over the years.\u000a\u000aIn fundamental terms, we understood the problem 20 years ago: Burn fossil fuels and you emit carbon dioxide. The structure of that molecule traps solar energy in our atmosphere that would otherwise radiate back out to space. It\u2019s why Mars is cold and Venus is terrifyingly hot.\u000a\u000aWhat we didn\u2019t know, however, is how fast this would happen\u2014and the hope, being humans, was that we had many decades to solve the problem. That would allow us to make a gradual, easy, affordable transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. This was the spirit in which, say, the Kyoto accords were negotiated. They called for modest reductions in emissions, and only from developed countries. Even in the few (mostly European) nations that implemented them, the change in daily life was imperceptible, which is how politicians like it.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, the scientific story has changed dramatically. In the summer of 2007, sea ice across the Arctic melted with extreme rapidity. By the time the season was over, there was 25% less ice than there had been a year earlier. That is a very large change in a basic physical feature of the planet. As scientists looked around, they saw evidence of the same massive flux in other systems: Glaciers were melting quickly in the Himalayas, seawater was turning acidic, and hydrological cycles\u2014drought and flood\u2014were becoming steadily more extreme.\u000a\u000aBy the winter of 2008, scientists were able to put a precise number on our predicament: Above 350 parts per million (ppm) of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) research team concluded, we couldn\u2019t have a planet \u201csimilar to the one on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted\u201d. That was scary news, because we\u2019re already well above that level, at 390 ppm. That\u2019s why the glaciers are melting.\u000a\u000aThis finding raised the stakes and changed the politics, because suddenly, much of civil society became far more outspoken. Some of us built a huge campaign, 350.org, that in late October mounted what CNN called \u201cthe most widespread day of political action in the planet\u2019s history\u201d, with 5,200 demonstrations in 181 countries. (Some of the biggest and most beautiful were across India, where campaigners did a remarkable job of communicating a difficult scientific truth.)\u000a\u000aCivil society found itself in common cause with a great number of nations who realized that their very survival was at stake. In the past, it had been possible for the great powers to simply promise a few billions in extra aid to poor countries at these negotiations, and they would drop their demands. But they\u2019d come to realize that there was not enough money on earth to help them cope with what was coming: small island states facing submersion, and African countries dealing with endless withering droughts, were demanding deep emissions cuts from the rich world.\u000a\u000aThe new science, however, hadn\u2019t altered the politics or the economics for the most important of those powerful countries. In the US, the influence of the fossil fuel lobby meant that both Congress and the White House wanted to move slowly, if at all. In China, the success of coal-powered development meant that leaders were reluctant to sign on to any real restrictions on future emissions, especially since there was no real moral obligation on them to do so. (China may have passed the US in total emissions, but it has four times the population, and since carbon lasts a century in the atmosphere, it\u2019s still Americans who are heating the planet.) As a result, as Copenhagen ground to an ungainly close, the powerful countries simply decided to shut off the pesky debate and take the talks into some new forum where they could more easily control the outcome.\u000a\u000aIndia was invited into that elite group, and it chose to accept. Now the onus falls squarely on those countries to produce a plan that grapples with the actual science. The temptation will be to pretend we\u2019re still in the same place we were 20 years ago, imagining we have many decades to make an easy transition. But that pretence is no longer easy to maintain. If COP15 (the 15th meeting of the Conference of Parties) established anything, it was a widespread understanding of how difficult this predicament is. Copenhagen couldn\u2019t put us on a path to 350 ppm. Now, Washington, New Delhi and Beijing will have to either take up the challenge, or ignore it and bear the blame for the rest of geological time.\u000a\u000afeedback@livemint.com

a((VUpdated: Sun, Jan 03 2010. 10 38 PM IST\u000a\u000aIn a globalized information-driven universe, India\u2019s national objectives of economic growth, development and poverty alleviation will depend as much on internal governance as on managing the external environment. Multilateral negotiating skills will, therefore, be important.\u000a\u000aThis became obvious with the stalemate at the 15th United Nations climate change conference (COP15) in Copenhagen last month, as the summit of global leaders\u2014including US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2014failed to achieve a breakthrough in negotiating a global treaty.\u000a\u000aClimate change will affect India in various ways, influencing the graph of our growth and development. There are security challenges as well arising from extreme climate events and disasters. India is also in a neighbourhood particularly vulnerable to climate change. This was highlighted by the dramatic holding of an underwater cabinet meeting in the Maldives and, at the opposite pole, at the base of Mt Everest in Nepal. Bangladesh, leading the charge of the least developed countries (LDCs), is also extremely vulnerable, given the prospect of a rise in sea levels\u2014all this could place pressure on migration to India.\u000a\u000aPhoto: Bloomberg Even though negotiating a favourable outcome was extremely important, the complexity of such interactions involving multiple interests was evident in Copenhagen. With the emergence of new power structures such as the European Union, the agglomeration of the African nations, multiple economic blocs such as the Group of Eight, the Group of 77, LDCs and a plethora of players including international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and multinational companies (MNCs), negotiating key treaties has become extremely complex. The power of large states, including the US, has declined, while new influential centres have yet to firmly establish themselves. This has made persuasion in the global arena a combination of finding common interests and achieving moral suasion.\u000a\u000aThere are other international treaties on the block shortly, such as review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the World Trade Organization. These are important international agreements which are linked to our growth cycle. Clearly, multilateral negotiations have thus emerged as a key foreign policy driver. And India needs better skills and institutions to tackle this.\u000a\u000aHence, first, the identification of key principles of foreign policy would be an important prerequisite towards this direction. While strategic autonomy, which some have ironically classified as \u201cisolationism\u201d, has served our national interests for some time, this may appear anachronous in a globalized world where integration rather than seclusion is the defining norm. A national debate would still be necessary to outline the parameters of international engagement for\u2014as the US-India 123 agreement for the civilian nuclear deal or COP15 has shown\u2014it will be increasingly difficult for the government to impose such treaties on the nation as a fait accompli.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, what is also necessary is building a political consensus that can provide our international negotiators with firm direction and thus avoid public acrimony\u2014as was seen in the evolution of India\u2019s COP15 strategy. While it is not necessary for everyone to agree, we have to be on the same page finally. Walkouts from the high table leave a bad taste and reduce our international clout.\u000a\u000aSecond, a degree of sophistication is also necessary in our parliamentarians, diplomats, opinion makers and corporate leaders to generate a healthy debate on the nuances of international issues. This can no longer be the preserve of a few elite policymakers or academics\u2014it is clearer than ever that these issue affect the grass roots. Providing research support, particularly to our parliamentarians, has become important: The expansion of the Parliament library service on the lines of the US Congressional Research Service is called for.\u000a\u000aThird, NGOs and companies are also important stakeholders in global negotiations\u2014their view would have to be incorporated. The media is another important institution which will play a positive role in facilitating public opinion\u2014it has to be made a partner in the process, despite whatever incorrect negative perception it generates.\u000a\u000aFourth: Once we identify our national interests, we have to evolve strategies to leverage these. Winning over like-minded players is essential. Here numbers as well as stature is important, as negotiations at the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the International Atomic Energy Agency demonstrated in 2008. Without the personal intervention of then-US president George Bush, many nations would not have supported the nuclear waiver for India.\u000a\u000aFifth, the congruence of issue-based interests, rather than the legacy of old partnerships and rivalries, would denote the right support to common causes. India and Pakistan, ironically, were on the same page in climate negotiations, despite differences in virtually all other fields. Similarly, forums as Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and Ibsa (India, Brazil and South Africa) would have to be used for joint lobbying.\u000a\u000aSixth, our diplomats need to build skills in international negotiations, with sound technical knowledge, multilingual capability and a flexible approach\u2014the barriers of bureaucracy must be broken.\u000a\u000aWith a national output of $3.3 trillion (in purchasing power parity terms), India is seen as a bridge between the developed and the developing world. Thus, effective multilateral negotiating skills are a prerequisite to thinking of our foreign policy. India certainly needs to work hard at being a good, and effective, global citizen in the future.\u000a\u000aRahul K. Bhonsle is editor, South Asia Security Trends. Comment at theirview@livemint.com

Japanese carmakers are racing to develop electric cars, and US and European manufacturers have also announced plans to roll them out within a few years.\u000a\u000aThe dream of an electric car, which has been around since the time of Thomas Edison, has so far failed to break into the mainstream because of limited battery life that makes such vehicles impractical for most purposes.\u000a\u000aBut after technological breakthroughs in the development of long-lasting lithium-ion batteries, soon it may not just be Hollywood stars who are zipping around in zero-emission automobiles.\u000a\u000aMitsubishi\u2019s electric car now runs 160 kilometres (100 miles) on one charge, which takes 14 hours when using a conventional 100 volt outlet on the wall, or 30 minutes to charge 80% of the battery using a special quick charger.\u000a\u000aWith the help of government subsidies, Mitsubishi Motors aims to sell its iMiEV at a price of less than three million yen (30,000 dollars) as early as 2010.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe price and the short mileage per charge are the two biggest challenges we must address,\u201d admitted Kazuhiro Yamana, head of Mitsubishi\u2019s public relations department.\u000a\u000aNissan Motor Co. aims to start selling an electric car in the United States and Japan in 2010 and the rest of the world in 2012.\u000a\u000aOther Japanese automakers have been working to create fuel cell cars, which produce electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, with water the only by-product.\u000a\u000aFuel cell cars have a number of advantages over electric cars, said Honda Motor Co. engineer Michio Shinohara.\u000a\u000aHonda began selling the latest FCX Clarity in the United States in July, with the first five cars to be delivered to celebrities including film producer Ron Yerxa and actress Jamie Lee Curtis.\u000a\u000aToyota Motor Corp., which has already won strong interest in its petrol-electric hybrids, is developing a range of fuel cell, electric and other clean cars that run on biofuel or clean diesel.\u000a\u000aToyota says its fuel cell car FCHV-adv can travel 830 kilometres on a full tank of hydrogen, but it may not see mass production until 2016.\u000a\u000aFuel cell vehicles belch out none of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, but their high cost and a lack of hydrogen refueling stations pose obstacles to mainstream use.\u000a\u000aSo far, the government-backed Japan Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Demonstration Project has constructed 12 hydrogen stations nationwide, with plans to build more stations for commercial use from 2015.\u000a\u000aBut experts question how much interest there will be for electric cars while the economy is in the doldrums.\u000a\u000aLonger term, green cars may be necessary lineups for carmakers because of regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, Endo said.\u000a\u000a\u201cGreen cars would be more sellable if the world economy recovers, which would lead to a surge in gasoline prices and generous government subsidies to purchase of green cars.\u201d\u000a\u000aJapanese automakers have enjoyed brisk demand for their smaller, fuel efficient cars in recent years.\u000a\u000aThe ailing Big Three US automakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - meanwhile have faced criticism in Washington for being too slow to shift their focus from gas-guzzling SUVs.\u000a\u000aBut even Japanese automakers still have more work to do before fuel-cell or electric vehicles are completely environmentally friendly.\u000a\u000aWhile fuel cell or electric vehicles emit no carbon dioxide themselves, CO2 is produced when hydrogen or electricity is produced from fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aHonda Motor has been conducting research into hydrogen generation from solar power since 2001, but only at an experimental level.

a((VAmid the alphabet soup and baffling procedures of last month's climate-change conference in Copenhagen, it was easy to forget the overall aim: to move from a world in which carbon dioxide emissions are rising to one in which they are falling, fast enough to make a difference.\u000a\u000aHow fast is enough? A fair measure is carbon and other greenhouse emissions in 2050; if by that date they are only half their 1990 level, most people agree, then things would be on the right track. Another widely accepted calculation: if developing countries are to grow a bit between now and then, rich countries would need to slash emissions to a level at least 80% below what they were in 1990.\u000a\u000aMany prosperous states have duly accepted that target; and in recent years the expression "80 per cent by 2050" has become a familiar, if optimistic, touchstone for discussions about climate change\u2014both in the rich world and among most other parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000aWhen drafts of a last-ditch agreement began circulating on December 18th, which should have been the meeting's final day, the "80 per cent by 2050" formula was still in place. But, hours later, it vanished. By this stage, efforts to find consensus among almost 200 delegations had given way to bargaining sessions among smallish groups of countries behind closed doors. When the fruits of that back-room trading were presented to the world by Barack Obama, the numbers were conspicuous by their absence.\u000a\u000aSo too were a number of other conditions that Europeans and others would have liked, such as a date for peak emissions. "Why?", a cluster of journalists asked Lars-Erik Liljelund, the Swedish government's point man on climate, in the early hours of Saturday December 19th. Why would a pledge that applied only to rich nations, and to which all those nations seemed to agree, have vanished from the final document? After maybe ten seconds of what-can-I-say silence came the flat reply: "China don't like numbers."\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ \u2018India dangerous weak link in n-security\u2019\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VThere is an alarming rise in sea level along the Indian coast since 2004,said Shailesh Nayak,Secretary,Ministry of Earth Sciences.\u000a\u000aAddressing the Indian Science Congress session on ‘Weather,Climate and Environment,’ Nayak said the seal-level rise during 2004-08 along the Indian coast was about 9 mm. The global average sea-level rise from 1961 to 2003 was 1.8 mm per year. The annual rate along the Indian coast was faster from 1993 to 2003 and has reached about 3.1mm a year.\u000a\u000aHe said the average temperature of global oceans had increased,contributing to the sea-level rise. However,the rise in sea waters could not be attributed to global warming alone. Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined in both hemispheres and their widespread decrease has contributed to the rising sea level,he said.\u000a\u000aHe said the rise in sea level and temperature was more or less the same across all oceans. “However,the question was to what level the sea would rise. The rise of water is undulating in nature. It could come and go in a particular coast and the phenomenon would not be uniform across all seas. Along the Indian coast,the higher rise was reported from the estuary of Hooghly river. The sea erosion at Lakshadweep islands could be partly due to the rise in sea level,” he said,adding that pilot project to study the phenomenon would be installed along the Chennai coast.\u000a\u000aOn earthquake and tsunami,Nayak said 70 cities in the country—including New Delhi and Bangalore—had been brought under earthquake mirco-zonation. Monitoring of geochemical precursors,including rising water level,was also being done in several parts of the country. He said satellite-based GPS could be used to determine whether an earthquake is strong enough to create an ocean tsunami. The current method generally underestimates large earthquakes such as the one occured in Sumatra in 2004. The GPS-based analysis can overcome this,he said.\u000a\u000aHe said widespread changes in extreme temperatures had been observed during the last 50 years. Cold days,cold nights and frost have become less frequent,while hot days,hot nights and heat waves have become more frequent. The frequency of heavy rain falls had increased over most land areas.\u000a\u000aMore intense and longer droughts had been observed over wider areas since the 1970s,particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions,he said. “The need of the hour is an improved monitoring of regional climate and understanding of the regional impacts of climate change particularly,the monsoon system,” Nayak said.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VDespite the Copenhagen chill, there are heart-warming tidings for the Punjab industrialists running green projects or planning to set up one. The state government plans to start a consultancy to offer services on no-profit-no-loss basis to companies intending to gain from carbon credits.\u000a\u000aExecutive Director of the Punjab State Council for Science and Technology (PSCST) Dr Neelima Jerath says to become eligible for carbon credits, a company has to go through multiple steps, the most important being preparation of project design document (PDD).\u000a\u000aThe process of getting registered for carbon credits is expensive, but the state government consultancy would charge much less than the private counterparts to attract industrialists towards energy-efficient methods. Asserting that they would keep special focus on small-scale industry, Dr Jerath says, "If project document is impressive, half the battle is won."\u000a\u000aThe work on the consultancy has begun, and the PSCST has issued an advertisement for hiring employees, she says. The staff would go to the field and study the project's emission scale. The PDD will then be sent to the national executive board of the Union Environment Ministry. "If the ministry wishes some changes in the project to make it eligible, we will help the company do that," she adds.\u000a\u000aAfter the board approves the report, an evaluator will study the project and tally the emissions balance-sheet with the PDD. If all is in place, the project is registered and sent to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and granted carbon credits as per the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA), which is the nodal agency for carbon credits, is offering free guidance to the industry. PEDA CEO T P S Sidhu says, "We have written letters to all the departments of Punjab to get in touch with us if they have any project that can help them earn credits. We are trying to gravitate the industry towards carbon credits with our slogan, 'set up a project and earn money'. Besides, we have been holding seminars and workshops for the industry and government departments to demystify the concept."\u000a\u000aEchoing Dr Jerath, Sidhu says becoming eligible for trading carbon credits is a high-ticket process, but long-term profits makes it worth every penny spent. He says now it has become mandatory for all the industry to have carbon credits built-in in the project.\u000a\u000aPEDA is showing the way with its biomethanation plant in Haebowal in Ludhiana. "The project has been evaluated by a US evaluator, and granted 53,000 VER (voluntary emission reduction) credits. At present, we are not cashing in on the credits, as we expect the rates to go up by March," says Sidhu.\u000a\u000aSources say it was important that the government comes up with a consultancy as some of the private consultants secure their share in the credits and indulge in arm-twisting. They say sometimes an industry is forced to hire a consultant from the country which is providing them machinery or helping in setting up the plant.\u000a\u000aHowever, quality service is what matter to the industrialists. B S Jangra, head of the power division of Malwa Power Pvt Ltd, Muktsar, which has secured 48,000 certified emission reduction (CER) credits, says, "We are happy to know that the government is opening a consultancy, and we would prefer it over the private firms. But, all we want is a superior service."\u000a\u000aCER and VER\u000a\u000aThe clean development mechanism (CDM) allows developing countries to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each of which is equivalent to one tonne of CO2. These CERs can be traded under the Kyoto Protocol. A VER (voluntary emission reduction) is also tradable, and the only difference is that while CERs are generated as per standards of the Kyoto Protocol and UNFCCC, VERs are independently verified by a third party, which provide written assurance of the integrity of the emission reductions.\u000a\u000aALSO READ A day after, Modi bricks disappear\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

"Although scientists remain deeply concerned about glacier retreat in that region, this particular prediction has subsequently proved to be incorrect," the WWF said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThere were reports that Hasnain \u2014 who is working with the Pachauri-led The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) since last year \u2014 had himself admitted that the 2035 reference in his 1999 interview was nothing more than "speculation" but he was not available today for comment.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC is already under scrutiny following the emergence of some leaked emails of its scientists some months ago, the contents of which revealed attempts to exaggerate the scientific evidence on global warming.

a((VMinister for Environment & Forests Jairam Ramesh has said he feels “vindicated” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) goof-up on Himalayan glaciers. Talking to the The Financial Express,the minister said India would soon have a well-equipped national agency for climate change assessment,as the UN body had proven unequal to the task.\u000a\u000aThe new agency would be “an Indian IPCC”,the minister said. He added that the UN body,with its biases,seemed incapable of original and genuine research.\u000a\u000aRamesh said the new agency would have a pan-IIT network as its backbone. He said it would be formed out of the fledgling Indian Network for Comprehensive Climatic Change Assessment. Once full-fledged,the new body would comprise 250 scientists from diverse disciplines and would leverage resources to produce a series of annual assessments for different sectors.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VFacing the most serious crisis of his tenure as chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), R K Pachauri on Saturday rejected demands for his resignation and said a single error could not be used to trash the credibility of the UN panel headed by him.\u000a\u000aAddressing his first press conference after the IPCC admitted to having gone wrong on the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035, Pachauri said he was concentrating on the next task of bringing out the fifth assessment report that is scheduled for release in 2013-14.\u000a\u000a"Those who are asking for my resignation will have to be disappointed. I have a job at hand. The fifth assessment report is in the making and I am going to ensure that this report is done well and strengthens the science on climate change," Pachauri, who is also the director general of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said.\u000a\u000aThe revelations about the 2035 date being completely off the mark has come as the latest trouble for Pachauri who was already being attacked from certain quarters for allegedly using his position in the IPCC for personal gains. "There has been an error. The IPCC has already said that the procedures which ought to have been followed were not completely followed in one particular instance. That doesn't mean the entire report is wrong or that global warming is not happening or that Himalayan glaciers are not melting," Pachauri said.\u000a\u000a"I don't think there is any crisis of credibility with the IPCC. IPCC is still very well regarded and respected by a vast majority of people across the world and I think that is how it will be," Pachauri said.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Narendra Modi a monster, Trinamool has pact with him: Buddha\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VRejecting attempts to make the Copenhagen Accord the new international legal framework on climate change, India and the three other major developing countries that constitute the BASIC group, on Sunday reaffirmed their commitment in the existing global arrangement that has the Kyoto Protocol and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at its centre.\u000a\u000aThe ministers of India, China, South Africa and Brazil met here in the backdrop of developments that these countries saw as the latest attempts by some rich nations to formalise the Copenhagen Accord \u2014 a political agreement that came out at the end of the climate change conference in the Danish capital last month \u2014 into an international treaty, sidelining the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aMany rich countries are extremely uncomfortable with the deep emission cuts demanded from them by the Kyoto Protocol and want to replace it with something less restrictive. The Copenhagen Accord, essentially the result of an agreement between BASIC countries and the US, is a nascent document and these countries hope to mould it into a legal framework that is more to their liking.\u000a\u000aFor the BASIC countries, and indeed the rest of the world, the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC process are sacrosanct \u2014 for precisely the same reason why the rich countries hate these.\u000a\u000a"The BASIC countries played a crucial role in finalising the Copenhagen Accord. We support it but we are of the view that the value of the Accord lies not as a standalone document but as an input into the two-track negotiating process being followed till now," Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aThe two-track process refers to the parallel negotiations going on for finalising the long-term global strategy to deal with climate change and also for fixing the new targets for greenhouse gas emission cuts by the rich countries for a period beyond 2012 when their current emission cut commitments come to an end.\u000a\u000aA joint statement at the end of the BASIC meeting demanded that negotiations should begin immediately on both these tracks and that the negotiating groups meet at least six times this year in order to conclude the final agreement at the next climate change conference in Mexico in December. The four countries also said that they would adhere to the January 31 deadline to communicate their voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC.\u000a\u000a"The members of the BASIC group have already announced a series of voluntary mitigation actions for 2020. The ministers expressed their intention to communicate information on their voluntary mitigation actions to the UNFCCC by January 31, 2010," the statement said. Sources said the voluntary actions from India would include the 20-25 per cent reduction in emission intensity by 2020 announced by New Delhi in the run-up to the Copenhagen conference.\u000a\u000aIn another significant move, the four countries considered the option of setting up a fund to help the poorer nations to adapt to climate change. "We discussed whether we can collectively do something in this regard. No conclusion was reached. We would hopefully come up with something concrete in our next meeting in April in Cape Town," Ramesh said, while demanding that the rich countries keep their promise of providing $10 billion to the most vulnerable countries this year.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Narendra Modi a monster, Trinamool has pact with him: Buddha\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VOver a four-day period in December 1952, a thick still fog settled on London. By the time it dissipated, an estimated 5,000 people had been killed. The culprit was the smoke and sulphur particles belching forth from thousands of chimneys throughout the city. Soot or black carbon is a major component of smoke. In addition to the health hazards, recent research has revealed that the black carbon traps significant amount of sunlight in the air, thus linking air pollution with climate change.\u000a\u000aFog forms when water vapour condenses on tiny particles in the air. The sources of those particles are both natural and manmade. In cities like London and Los Angeles, man-made particles from industrial smoke can outnumber natural particles by factors of two to 10 while in cities like Delhi, Beijing or Mexico City, smoke particles can be 10 to 100 times more. During winter, sudden drops in temperature trigger condensation of moisture on the haze particles, leading to persistent fog events. This smoke-filled fog or smog blocks sunlight from reaching the ground causing dimming and visibility reduction \u2014 which in turn cools the ground.\u000a\u000aThe 1952 London fog made the city colder, so people threw more coal on their home fires and fed the toxic haze, what we would now refer to as a brown cloud. There is also a feedback of sorts that develops when fog and smoke mix. The intense solar heating of air and dimming at the ground by the soot can make things worse; eventually, the pollution will be concentrated at ground level. In London, the elderly and other vulnerable residents literally suffocated to death as they walked the streets.\u000a\u000aSmoke from one kitchen fire or one lorry may seem innocuous enough but when burning in their millions, and combined with episodes like the recent heavy fog that blanketed Delhi, the historical precedents should alarm us. The particles remain aloft for as much as two weeks, enough time for the pollution to become widespread and blanket all of the Indo-Gangetic plains with a 3 km thick "brown cloud" \u2014 and even coat Himalayan glaciers with a layer of black carbon, as seen routinely in satellite images. The estimated regional impacts include large-scale dimming, disruption of monsoon rainfall, melting of Himalayan snowpacks and glaciers, decrease in rice yields and a contribution to nearly one million deaths annually.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Degrees of irresponsibility\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VClimate Change Fundamentalists, like all fundamentalists, are not concerned with balance, context and the possibility of being wrongjust moral absolutes. Protect the environment now! Ban pollution! Which is why they miss the obvious reason why a climate deal cannot be struck. The unravelling of the Copenhagen consensus had little to do with the understanding of climate change, and much to do with the equity of the response.\u000a\u000aIndustrialised countries point to the fact that developing countries account for almost 45% of man-made CO2 emissions todayalmost on par with industrialised countries.\u000a\u000aThey argue that this necessitates that developing countries curb emissions, too. In his speech to the Kyoto Climate Change Conference in December 1997, then-US Vice-President Al Gore said, I am instructing our delegation right now to show increased negotiation flexibility if a comprehensive plan can be put in place, one with realistic targets and timetables, market mechanisms, and the meaningful participation of key developing countries. Developing countries retort that industrialised countries account for 70% of the stock of man-made carbon dioxide emissions. Add in other pollutants and air travel and that figure rises above 80%. Developed countries are rich in part because they raided the environment first and now they want to put a stop to raids. What the world needs, developing countries say, is for the rich countries to get off their well-padded backsides and make meaningful reductions in emissions now.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide emissions per capita are sharply different with developed countries being on average around 3 times that of developing countries10 tonne per capita per year versus 4 tonnes. The overall picture of the production of carbon dioxide, or consumption of goods that lead to carbon dioxide emissions in their production, is even starker when rich countries are compared with India given the popularity of Indian vegetarianism. Sir Nicholas Stern of the UKs Climate Change Report has argued that the single most important thing individuals could do about climate change is to become vegetarian.\u000a\u000aThe following illustrates the equity issue. Try and achieve a target of reduced emissions per country and you crimp the development prospects of poor countries. Try and achieve the same target by limiting emissions per person and you hit developed countries. Not surprisingly, developed countries have focused on the former approach and complained that developing countries just dont get it by refusing to accept limits to emissions growth. They then add that if poor countries are not going to shift their weight behind reduced emissions, why should they\u000a\u000aThis is rather like saying that on average we eat too much and so we require everyone, irrespective of whether they are underweight, bulimic or starving, to do their bit to reduce world over-eating by cutting their consumption by a similar amount. It ignores context. It is also an odd moral yardstick. It is like a billionaire saying that he refuses to pay taxes unless the poorest pay, too. It assumes that deferring current consumption to improve the consumption of our children is indifferent to issues of income per head, economic growth rates or life expectancies. This is also economic nonsense. This deferral of consumption makes far less sense to someone in India with a relatively low life expectancy who expects their children to have a far better life than they had because of 8% economic growth per year than it does to someone in Denmark with a long life expectancy in a country with relatively slow economic growth. Their future consumption discount rates differ.\u000a\u000aThe right approach and the one India should hold out for is to limit the amount of production of CO2 per capita and to phase in this limit over time. To throw up a number, the world could agree to limit man-made CO2 emissions to 7 tonne per person per year. Multiplying this number by a countrys population would give a country emission entitlement that could be traded within and between countries. This would force countries with the resources to conserve and protect the environmentresources that were partly accumulated through their earlier degradation of the environmentto do so or suffer a fall in output. And it would support the development of those countries that need developing by boosting their income if they sell their unused entitlements. This global cap-and-trade would reward vegetarianism, forestation and low-carbon growth and penalise McDonalds and the highly inefficient conversion of grass and grains into meat. On all these grounds and more it is the right solution to the problem of an over production of carbon dioxide. But it would imply a shift in wealth from developed to developing, from those that polluted in the past to those that did not.\u000a\u000aThe author is chairman of Intelligence Capital Ltd, chairman of the Warwick Commission, and member of the UN Commission of Experts on Financial Reform

We were able to make only limited progress at the Copenhagen Summit and no one was satisfied with the outcome.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, there is no escaping the truth that the nations of the world have to move to a low greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficient development path, he said.\u000a\u000aSingh, who was among over 100 world leaders who attended the finale of the 12-day summit in the Danish capital, said nations are chalking out strategies to achieve greater energy efficiency and a shift to renewable energy sources, as well as for adapting to climate change which is inevitable.\u000a\u000aIndia, he said, must not lag behind in these areas. Indeed we should plan to be among the leaders in the development of science and technology related to mitigation and also adaptation to climate change.

a((VThe world climate clock was ticking away as the international community debated the tradeoff between saving the environment and fuelling economic growth. At the Stockholm conference held in 1972, countries had pledged to work towards preserving the fragile environment of the planet. Yet, nearly four decades later, the global community continues to bicker over ways and means to tackle climate change.\u000a\u000aFor India, the time is right to evaluate its stance on the issue. India not only has to reduce its usage of coal and oil but also strive to become self-sufficient in clean and low-cost energy. Its a big challenge, but, as they say, in every challenge there is an opportunity. Indian business enterprises have shown in recent decades that it can do pioneering research & development. As green technologies beckon future development and cash flows, India Inc has to jump on to the bandwagon. Already, some of our companies, like Suzlon, are at the forefront of the global renewable energy business.\u000a\u000aThe government must encourage private initiatives by promoting investment in businesses that use renewable energy. It should also make greater efforts to develop indigenous clean technologies. With proper planning and priority credit lending to businesses that want to switch to renewable energy modes, India can become a global leader in clean technology.\u000a\u000aTo reduce the use of fossil fuelsthe root cause of global warmingbusiness enterprises have to conserve energy. One way to cut energy useage is for power producers to develop a smart grid system that optimises operation and distributes power with minimum T&D losses. Such a grid is being used in developed countries along with hybrid power stations that combine solar panels and wind turbines with a conventional generator.\u000a\u000aIn a recent leader, The Economist had a point to make that India should take note of: A good policy framework would include some regulation in areas where the market doesnt work well, such as the energy-efficiency of buildings and appliances. It would include a modicum of subsidy, on research into technologies that are still a long way from being marketable, such as carbon capture and storage. But it would rely largely on by far the most efficient tool in the policymakers kita carbon price. A carbon price sends business a price signal to invest in clean stuff, not dirty stuff. It doesnt involve micromanaging business, which regulations do. It doesnt impose a burden on taxpayers, or require governments to pick winners, which subsidies do. It is, according to an American study, twice as efficient as any other policy.\u000a\u000aSeen in the light of the opportunities that lie ahead, the Copenhagen summit has laid the path for the growth of Indias clean tech economy.\u000a\u000aThe author is PGPM 2009-10 student of Great Lakes Institute of Management.\u000a\u000aEmail: shubhangi.muralidhar@greatlakes.edu.in

The manual released by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, draws upon the rich and diverse past experience of drought management and suggests an extensive list of procedures and measures that need to be taken for alleviating the impact of drought.\u000a\u000aIndia has witnessed 22 major droughts in the past 20 years and 7 droughts during the last three decades alone, which not only impact farm output, but also leads to shortage of drinking water, fodder deficiency and low water in reservoirs. Of the 22 major droughts, last seven have occurred during 1982, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1999, 2000 and 2002. In 2009, 14 States faced drought in 334 districts.\u000a\u000aEvidently, effective and comprehensive management of droughts encompassing early warning, monitoring, relief and mitigation is a major concern in the domain of public administration, the statement added. The department of agriculture and cooperation had requested the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) to prepare a manual reflecting a comprehensive and coordinated approach to management of drought recommending measures.\u000a\u000aLast month, a parliamentary panel has directed the agriculture ministry to re-work its drought management and drought monitoring set up with adequate powers and expertise in view of the severity and impact of this years low monsoon and also to adequately prepare for such future exigencies.

Bangladesh has one-third of its land below sea-level.\u000a\u000aWhen Mahatma Gandhi went on his famed Dandi March, he was asserting that sea is a social resource that cannot be taxed. But then, this also implicitly conveys that sea as public resource needs to be optimally tapped, Swaminathan who was here recently for the Indian Science Congress told FE.\u000a\u000aDeveloping seawater farming and below seawater farming techniques are vital for combating climatic changes like storms and famines. Kuttanad, one of Indias 25 Ramsar sites, could be a suitable spot for an international below sea-level farming research and extension centre, he said. Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance, by the resolution of Ramsar Convention 1971.\u000a\u000aWhat is unique to Kuttanad was that its rice cultivation practice was not evolved by scientists, but by local farmers. The farmers use a combination or rotation of paddy or fish to get maximum yield from their lands. This is found effective in checking weeds, pests and diseases.\u000a\u000aSwaminathan has also recommended that coastal defences be strengthened against more frequent storms and tsunamis through setting up bio-shields of mangrove species.\u000a\u000aHe said wheat yield in rainfed areas of the country could fall by 44% in 2050 if adaptation steps were not taken.\u000a\u000aAbout 50% of Indias wheat-growing areas are heat- stressed lower potential areas. For every 1 degree Celsius rise in mean temperature, the wheat loss is around 6 million tonne per year.\u000a\u000aNorth India was vulnerable to stem rust disease in wheat, if temperatures shot up b 2 degree Celsius. Compared to wheat, rice is a more climate-resilient crop. According to Swaminathan some solutions to the continuing climatic issues and food shortages were setting up pulse villages (to tackle nutrition deficiency) and a movement to plant 1 billion fertiliser trees (to boost soil nutrition status and sequester carbon).\u000a\u000aBut at the consumption level, the food basket has to be broadbased, Swaminathan argues.\u000a\u000aThis means, like wheat and rice, millets and raggi too can be distributed through PDS. When hunger strikes, it is survival rather than nutrition that is significant as is illustrated by the forest-dwelling communities relying on species like yams, roots and tubers.\u000a\u000aAt the state-level, governments need to reward tribal cultivators who take initiative in preserving endangered species of crops like varieties of yam and colacasia, he says.

It has done irreparable damage to the climate through the dramatic rise in carbon dioxide emissions, resulting in global warming. Never in the past has the agenda of climate change been supported by economics imperatives. At the same time, the senseless consumption of oil over the last five decades has depleted the availability of the commodity.\u000a\u000aThere is very little disagreement globally over the need to contain carbon emissions immediately if we have to avoid wrecking damage to the planet. Using results from formal economic models, the Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change has estimated that if the human race doesn't act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year forever. If wider-range risks and impacts are taken into account, the estimates of damage may rise to 20% of GDP.\u000a\u000aMore than half of the worlds population lives in poverty and a solution to climate change that seeks to curb economic growth in developing countries will be politically hazardous for them. A recent McKinsey study says that to achieve the objective of stabilising GHG emission while maintaining economic growth will require a ten-fold increase in carbon productivity, ie., the amount of GDP produced per unit of carbon equivalent (CO2e) emitted. This target is comparable to labour productivity increases in the Industrial Revolution but it will have to be achieved in one-third of the time if the world is to keep the current economic growth levels. It is, therefore, virtually impossible to achieve this feat without reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aThis envisages three shifts in the global energy paradigm. One, renewable energy, which has played a second fiddle to fossil fuels, will take centre-stage as the primary driver of global economic growth. Two, as we transition from the second to third Industrial Revolution, global manufacturing base will move to regions with clean energy sources. Three, nations which use this opportunity to phase out the use of fossil fuels will gain an unparalleled competitive advantage and emerge as dominant economic powers in second half of the 21st century.\u000a\u000aToday, technology exists to not only produce renewable energy optimally but also distribute it in a granular fashion with economic costs comparable with those of the traditional fossil fuel energy. New investment in renewable energy in the next 10-20 years will have a profound effect the global energy mix. Early signs of investment in renewable energy are encouraging but needs to increase significantly. Global investment in renewables topped $148 billion in 2007, a 60% increase from 2006. By conservative estimates, global investments in renewable energies are expected to leap to euro 250 billion by 2020 and euro 460 billion by 2030.\u000a\u000aAccording to a study by the University of California, adopting comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation could create up to 1.9 million jobs, increase annual household income by $487-1,175 per year and boost GDP by $39 billion to $111 billion in the US alone. In Germany, the renewable energy industry boasted of an annual turnover of euro 21.6 billion and 2,14,000 workers in 2006.\u000a\u000aThe EU has been in the forefront of the third Industrial Revolution. It is the first regional bloc to take the lead in committing to a target of 20% renewable energy and an equivalent reduction of emission by 2020. Various initiatives at country and regional levels that have been taken will start showing results by 2015. By 2050, renewable energy is projected to provide nearly half the primary energy and 70% of the electricity produced in the EU. The Desertec Industrial Initiative of the EU aims to supply 15% of its energy needs by 2050 through solar-generated electricity. In 2008, the European Commission announced a Joint Technology Initiative to speed up the commercial introduction of a hydrogen economy in the EU.\u000a\u000aIt's past time that the economic imperatives of renewable energy replaced the debate between developing and developed countries about the depth of carbon emission cuts to be undertaken by each of them. Speedy transfer of renewable energy technologies from the developed to developing world will help the latter maintain economic growth sans job losses.\u000a\u000aThe transition from carbon to renewable economy will create a dramatic influence on the globalisation process in the second half of 21st century. The transition will require substantial transformation of energy infrastructure, reconfiguring industries, retraining workers and realignment of global power hubs. Early adopters will have an advantage of being ready to embrace this wholesale change while laggards will witness bleak economic growth. Each country will now have to choose to either be a laggard or be in the forefront of this game changing revolution.\u000a\u000aThe writer is business development manager for Infosys and a fellow of India-China Institute.

a((VPower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Like so many other sayings that have stood the test of time, this one has also seen plenty of exceptions. Not all powerful people or institutions are crooked. Not all the accusations planted against them are creditable. But what remains cross-contextually proper is that powerful people and institutions must be subjected to constant, close scrutiny. And no one can deny that a lot of power is floating around in the climate change orbit today, especially with the stars of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u000a\u000aIn 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was shared between Al Gore and the IPCC, represented by its chair Rajendra Pachauri. They were being rewarded for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change. Today, beyond the Nobel, the IPCC has a far-reaching influence on people, policymakers and markets. What kind of cars should people drive and companies manufacture Should all humans switch to vegetarianism What kind of power plants should fuel the global economy Should we work from home instead of putting in time at offices What kind of agriculture can sustain both the planet and its inhabitants IPCC has taken on the mantle of decisively answering a host of questions for not just todays but also tomorrows generations.\u000a\u000aThe global community accepted IPCCs directions because of the belief that the organisation was providing them the best possible scientific advice on climate change, a phenomenon that was so conceptually novel, complex and momentous that traditional, nationalistic policymaking couldnt wing solo solutions. Even the international formulations for trade and suchlike that were already in place desperately needed the guidance of a technically educated mediator. It has been to the credit of the international community that it accepted IPCC as both an indispensable intermediary and an objective representative of science.\u000a\u000aTrouble in paradise\u000a\u000aA London-based newspapers investigations have now forced IPCC to reexamine one of its central research claimsthat climate change will melt most of the Himalayan glaciers by 2035. This claim was part of a benchmark report that claimed to represent the latest and most detailed research on the impact of global warming. Once this claim is retracted, and the IPCC has little room to do otherwise, a lot of its other assertions will also come into dispute. Before getting into the impact of that, lets understand the magnitude of the IPCCs glacier blunder.\u000a\u000aIn its 2007 report on climate change and its impacts, IPCC noted that the Himalayan glaciers form the largest body of ice outside the polar caps and are the source of water for the innumerable rivers that flow across the Indo-Gangetic plains. They form a unique reservoir supporting perennial rivers that represent the lifeline for millions of people, with the Gangetic basin alone being home to 500 million. The report said that Himalayan glaciers were receding faster than in any other part of the world.\u000a\u000aUnder current circumstances, there was a high likelihood posited for their disappearance by 2035 and perhaps sooner.\u000a\u000aWhat has now emerged is that the IPCC warning was based on a news story in the New Scientist. Worse, the popular science journal had published the relevant story eight years before the IPCCs 2007 report. Even worse, the news story was based on a short telephone interview with a scientist who has admitted that his claims were speculative rather than based on any formal research.\u000a\u000aThis raises troubling questions about the IPCCs review process. Every respectable PhD studenteven in the humanities!is taught to trace his or her material back to its source. The peer review process has been created to weed out guesswork. Hearsay is expected to be buried rather than built over, especially by internationally recognised institutions. Extreme claims, whether in the petty cause of self-aggrandisement or the more noble pursuit of human progress, are not expected to make it to the publication stage.\u000a\u000aThe glacier claim broke through all such checks and balances. Whats drawn extra attention to the breach is a) the other controversies that have lately rocked the climate change czars and b) the fact that the Indian environment and forests minister has been diligently drawing attention to the glacier issue since he took office in May 2009.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, the first of the big new scandals had nothing to do with IPCC. Thousands of e-mails and documents were stolen from a server at the University of East Anglias climatic research centre in the UK. A hue and cry over the theft itself soon took a backstage as people actually read the stolen documents. One e-mail had the head of the climatic research unit writing, I cant see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out somehoweven if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is! Scientists are not always scientific, the leaks cried out loud. This could have been played down as just a simple instance of human idiosyncrasy but for the fact that the IPCC head initially played down the incident, as did Gore. The champions of science didnt do a good job of standing by their cause.\u000a\u000aSince then, questions have been raised about the profit-making motives of the Teri and IPCC head. Whether or not its fair, people in power, especially those who espouse a self-righteous cause, have to repeatedly prove themselves as exemplars. Otherwise the cause takes a beating. The IPCC process has to come across as living up to the best scientific practices. If it lets the horse of public opinion ride away, would it really matter how conscientious it had actually been

a((VMinister for environment & forests Jairam Ramesh said he felt vindicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) goof-up on the life of Himalayan glaciers. In an exclusive interview with FE, the minister said India would soon have a well-equipped national agency for climate change assessment, as the UN body has proven unequal to the task.\u000a\u000aMy ministry brought out a discussion paper on glaciers after it was found that major divergence of views existed between Indian scientists and the IPCC, he said. The new agency would be an Indian IPCC, the minister said. He added that the UN body, with its biases, seems incapable of original and genuine research, in addition to being insensitive to regional realities.\u000a\u000aUnder the weight of indigenously researched evidence and commentaries, IPCC on Wednesday accepted that it had made a mistake in holding an alarmist view that Himalayan glaciers might disappear by 2035. Ramesh said the new national agency would have a pan-IIT network as its backbone. The minister believes IPCC has debased itself into being a mere aggregator of available literature.\u000a\u000aThe minister said the new national climate research body would be formed out of the fledgling Indian Network for Comprehensive Climatic Change Assessment (INCCCA). Once full-fledged, the new body would comprise 250 scientists from diverse disciplines and would leverage resources to produce a series of annual assessments for different sectors, the first by November 2010. The minister added that he would discuss the modalities for setting up INCCCA with the top research institutions of the country at IIT-Mumbai on March 12.\u000a\u000aIn a virtual rebuttal of the IPCCs 2007 assessment on Himalayan glaciers, the ministrys discussion paper said it was premature to conjecture that the Himalayan glaciers are retreating abnormally because of global warming. Essentially, the discussion paper authored by Geological Survey of India former deputy director-general VK Raina said 150 years of data on 25 glaciers in the region would reveal that regional and local geomorphic features have had as much influence on the snout fluctuations as climate parameters.\u000a\u000aIt said that over the last century, different glaciers have behaved in contrasting ways. While most were retreating, some like Siachen were advancing, and in some cases--Gangotri, for instance--the retreat has lately been decelerating.\u000a\u000aThe minister added: People who speak with a great deal of certainty that science has shown (something) are not right. There is a great deal of probability. One has to be a little more cautious. But one thing that needs to be recognised is that global warming is a reality and we have to mount a creative response--which is rooted in our interest rather than one influenced by international negotiations.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, the Geneva-based IPCC said on Wednesday that the conclusion in its fourth assessment report about Himalayan glaciers was based on poorly substantiated estimates of the rate of recession and date of disappearance of Himalayan glaciers. Regretting the mistake, it said, Clear and well-established standards of evidence, required by IPCC procedures, were not applied properly.\u000a\u000aRamesh said, The whole Himalayan glacier episode has shown that we need to have our own scientific capacity, which is networked globally. But you need a critical mass of local people looking at climate change in terms of sectors and regions. They should also be designing appropriate interventions to deal with that.

a((VUnderlining that India was ready to allocate up to $50 million to support several initiatives in order to strengthen links with the Asean member nations, the government has called for a regional approach on energy matters that can accommodate competing demands and constraints while shifting the focus from competition to cooperation.\u000a\u000aWhile inaugurating the Delhi Dialogue II-2010Regional Security and Cooperation Dialogueorganised by external affairs ministry along with Ficci and co-partnered Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) and Economic Research Institute for Asean and East Asia (ERIA), Jakarta and supported by SAEA Research Group, Singapore, minister of external affairs SM Krishna said, We look forward to a continued engagement with Asean countries and our partners in the East Asia Summit on this issue, as this can accommodate competing demands.\u000a\u000aKrishna said India-Asean FTA in goods, which came into force on January 1, has opened new possibilities for the expansion of Indias trade with the region and expressed hope that agreements on trade-in-services and investment would also be concluded soon. He also noted that people-to-people contacts and cultural & academic exchanges between India and the Asean region have continued to grow. The revival of the Nalanda University as an international institution of excellence, he added, has emerged as an important initiative that underlines the ancient linkages of the two regions.\u000a\u000aWe strongly believe in sharing our developmental experiences with our fellow developing countries and have been happy to participate in development cooperation programmes with Asean countries, and in the Initiative for Asean Integration programme, he said. According to him, India has laid emphasis on human resource development via training, scholarships, establishment of entrepreneurship development centres and language training centers.\u000a\u000aHe said the Asean-India S&T Fund that has been operationalised, would promote joint collaborative research projects in science and technology. The proposed $5 milliom India-Asean Green Fund would promote adaptation and mitigation technologies in the area of climate change.\u000a\u000aAt the 7th India-Asean Summit in October 2009, PM Manmohan Singh had announced several initiatives to further strengthen the links between India and Asean, including establishment of an India- Asean Round Table comprising think tanks, policy makers, scholars, media and business representatives that would provide policy inputs to the governments of India and the Asean countries on future areas of cooperation. At that meeting Singh had called for intensification of negotiations on an open skies policy; further simplification of the visa regime to encourage business and tourist travel; more youth exchange programmes; enhanced cooperation in the agriculture sector to meet the challenges of food security; cooperation in the application of space technologies; holding an Asean trade and industrial exhibition in India; among others.\u000a\u000aAccording to him, in the wake of the recent global financial and economic crisis, it was imperative to develop greater cooperation among developing countries, so that these countries have an effective voice in the international financial architecture and a new global economic order.

a((VIndia should have a robust domestic strategy for climate change, rather than being dictated by international negotiations, environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said. The minister said Indian corporates should shun old mindsets to aggressively invest manpower and money in green technology, an area of immense business opportunity which China is already betting on in a big way.\u000a\u000aChinese have sensed a business opportunity and are taking a strategic gamble that they will be the worlds leading supplier of green technology by 2020. We see all this as a threat. Some of our industry associations are still stuck in the old mindset. They should see this (GT) as a great opportunity, Ramesh said. During a wide-ranging interview with FE, Ramesh said , all our thinking on climate change is dictated by international negotiations. We have never had a strategic domestic agenda.\u000a\u000aWhile stressing on the commonality of interests that drives the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) which helped them to negotiate from a position of strength at the recent Copenhagen summit, the minister said these countries domestic strategies would, however, diverge. The Chinese have started to think of the peaking year as between 2025 and 2030. So have the South Africans, he said. But India was part of a different ball game because even as the third largest emitter by 2020, the country would account for only 8-9% of worlds greenhouse gas emissions, which in per capita terms, would still be very low at 2-2.5 tonnes.\u000a\u000aDoubtful if China would ever agree to internationally-binding legal commitment on emission reduction, he reiterated that India is prepared to reflect its domestic commitment internationally in any form other than a legally binding framework.

a((VThanks to the patron saint of conservation, Al Gore, the challenge of climate change has come to mean lesser carbon emissions by consuming less. Future action seems to be premised on the sacrifice we make today. But is carbon dioxide the real villain Scientists say that it is not the major greenhouse gas. Changes in carbon dioxide levels do not necessarily mirror human activity.\u000a\u000aHistorically, carbon dioxide levels have risen after a rise in temperature, not the other way round. Studies show that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide, while holding all other inputs steady, yields a 70% increase in plant growth as well as an increase in agricultural productivity. Moreover, the transportation sector and fossil fuel consumption produce less carbon emissions compared to the likes of what cows and sheep generate through flatulence, belching and manure. The methane thus emitted could be 25 times more potent. Human activity accounts for, some argue, only 2% of global carbon emissions while natural processes like plant decay cause the rest. Though we are emitting much more carbon dioxide than we should, carbon dioxide is not a particularly efficient greenhouse gas. Doubling of carbon dioxide traps less than 2% of the earths outgoing radiation. As for atmospheric carbon dioxide, a giga-tonne added to air has less radiative impact than the previous condition.\u000a\u000aThe environment works like a commons, where it is pointless if one party confirms to good behaviour when others do not. Prices of negative or positive externalities are high here. Most pollution is a negative externality of our consumption. The incentives and disincentives are weak for reducing consumption. When you look at collective behaviour, these are weaker still. It is even true when our welfare is at stake. If the correlations between knowing and doing were positive, people would never indulge in hazardous behaviour.\u000a\u000aPerhaps we require a magic bullet, because people dont respond well if there are no incentives and disincentives. And people dont necessarily change their behaviour even if they stand to benefit the most from the required change. Just like the idea of a zero carbon society is too optimistic, as the half-life of atmospheric carbon dioxide is roughly a hundred years and some of it remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years, similarly solar power is not without problems. It may make global warming worse. Solar cells are black and they are designed to absorb light from the sun. Only 12% gets converted into electricity, and the rest is radiated as heataiding global warming.\u000a\u000aOrdinarily, carbon dioxide goes into the troposphere, stays there and then falls down as acid rain. But volcanic eruption sends up sulphur dioxide much more intensely, as the Mount Pinatubo eruption showed in 1991. In such cases, the sulphur dioxide forms an aerosol cloud that circulates rapidly, to envelope most of the globe. After the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the earth cooled off by an average of nearly one degree Fahrenheit, reversing the global warming of 100 years. A National Academy of Science report has floated the idea of intentionally spreading sulphur dioxide in to the atmosphere. This is called the Budyko blanket. When some scientists tried this phenomenon, all they found was that geo-engineering of this sort could stabilise the climate even in the face of a large spike in carbon dioxide. As per Intellectual Ventures estimation, 100,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year can effectively reverse warming in the high Arctic. To most policymakers, this looks like polluting the environment to save it from global warming.\u000a\u000aThere is a second plan based on extending the smoke stack at a few strategically located carbon dioxide belching power plants. It turns out that the amount of stratospheric sulphur necessary to cool the planet is equal to the amount belched by these plants. But this will have the same cooling effect as the garden hose scheme. John Latham, the British climate scientist who has joined the IV stable recently has brought in another concepta sky full of puffy white clouds. As per Lathams reckoning, a 10-12% increase in the reflectivity of ocean clouds can cool the earth enough to counteract the doubling of current greenhouse gas levels. The strategy is to use the ocean to create more clouds.\u000a\u000aSome think that a carbon-induced apocalypse is not logical and we can avert this catastrophe simply by curtailing new carbon emissions. Hence, geo-engineering seems to be an answer. The objection to geo-engineering is that we will be altering the natural state of the earth by scientific intervention. But we have already geo-engineered the earth, havent we\u000a\u000aWhile mankind can go on reducing emissions, it is better to have a geo-engineering backup. Otherwise, at the end of the tunnel, we may find that human beings have not sacrificed as expected. We may find that we were too optimistic while doing too little or that we did too little too late.\u000a\u000aThis article is hugely influenced by Superfreakonomics.

a((VEnvironment and forests ministerspoke about the Copenhagen Accord, the BASIC quartet and Indias low-carbon growth strategy in an exclusive interview withand. The minister expressed concern at Chinas early advances in green technology and emphasized on the need for Indian business to look at the burgeoning sector seriously. Excerpts:\u000a\u000aSince the US seems to be inclined to negotiate directly with the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) nations, how valid are the Kyoto (Protocol) and the UNFCCC framework going to be\u000a\u000aNo doubt, the Copenhagen accord that was agreed to by 29 countries, was made possible through the negotiations between President Obama and the four BASIC heads of states. But the UNFCCC continues to remain the fundamental anchor of all climate change negotiations. And the Kyoto Protocol is the only legally binding instrument negotiated on the international arena.\u000a\u000aThe US has not ratified the Protocol and China is not obligated to be a member. In todays context, this is a serious problem as the two countries together account for 45% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With these and other inherent limitations, the Kyoto Protocol may be in intensive care, but it has probably got a fresh lease of life.\u000a\u000aAt Copenhagen, the mandate was to continue negotiations for the second commitment period, that is post-2012. But UN FCCC remains the anchor.\u000a\u000aOne of the limitations in all these agreements is the absence of graduation criteria based on economic parameters like per capita income, but I think it is rather late in the game (to include them). To address this problem, all the 194 countries would need to come together and say that they need a new architecture. That seems an unlikely prospect.\u000a\u000aWont it be easier to apportion the future carbon space if per capita income becomes the parameter\u000a\u000aAbsolutely. Graduation is the fundamental principle. Unfortunately, the world is divided into developed countries and developing countries, a very simplistic binary distinction, although the reality is much more complex than that.\u000a\u000aI see negotiations becoming increasingly difficult. The Chinese will be hell-bent not to take any legally binding commitment. The Americans clearly dont want to be a part of an international legally binding regime and their commitments are pretty modest (3-4% reduction by 2020). Of course, they are very aggressive for the year 2050. But , the proof of the pudding is what commitments you are taking for the year 2020. The Europeans are proposing a 20% reduction from 1990 reference levels. The developing countries have said it would be a 25-40% reduction. We are nowhere close to what the actual requirement is, as far as the mid-term target is concerned.\u000a\u000aIndias voluntary commitment on reduction of emission intensity of GDP by up to 25% seems to take us much closer to the Chinese position. But there is also a feeling that China would move away from this, once it becomes a fully developed country with a higher per capita income. What will India do at that stage\u000a\u000aChina is undoubtedly under great pressure because it is at present the worlds number one greenhouse gas emitter at 23%. They are going to sustain these devils of economic growth. But the Chinese have started to think of the peaking year (the year from which emissions would come down) between 2025 and 2030. The South Africans too have talked about peaking.\u000a\u000aStill, I am not sure whether China will ever agree to an internationally binding legal commitment.\u000a\u000aWill India also follow the same path and talk about peaking\u000a\u000aNo, India is part of a different ball game because we are at present at 5% of world greenhouse gas emissions and by 2020, we could reach about 8-9%. We would be the third largest emitter after China and the US. But mind you, the first (China) and second (the US) will be pretty close at around 25%, and then, the third (India) will be at 8-9%. In per capita terms we will still be very low and wont exceed 2-2.5 tonne per capita, at most.\u000a\u000aBut the 20-25% reduction target by 2020 on 2005 reference level is an easily attainable target. In fact, we will do better than this. We only have to continue our trajectory of super-critical power generation and move on to the next stage of ultra super critical stations. The national mission on energy efficiency and the proposed market based mechanism would also help.\u000a\u000aThe reduction in emission intensity has many collateral benefits. It makes the economy cleaner.\u000a\u000aBefore you went to Copenhagen, the Prime Minister made a specific statement that as part of the differentiated responsibility clause in UNFCCC framework, we would expect the developed countries to transfer technologies on easier terms. Now you are saying that China may never agree to legally binding target. So where do things stand Is it reasonable for us to expect technology (from the developed world)\u000a\u000aMake no mistake. Nobody wants to give money in large quantities. There is not even a thing called technology transfer in todays world. Technology is a commodity which is purchased, negotiated or even stolen (but not transferred). You are, however, going to have technology transactions like that between Bhel and Alstom for super-critical turbines.\u000a\u000aIn this context, recently Gordon Brown wrote a piece in the Newsweek, where he gave a specific figure of $33 trillion worth of green investment in energy and infrastructure by 2030. Do you think that a lot of this could arise in China and India\u000a\u000aThere is a McKinsey report, which I agree to broadly, that 80% of Indias infrastructure required for 2030 is required to be built. This is a phenomenal opportunity for us in the area of green technology. What we have done in IT, we can replicate in GT (green technology). Suzlon is already the worlds fifth largest wind-energy company.\u000a\u000aIf you look at the top 10 solar-energy companies, four happen to be from China. Chinese have sensed a business opportunity and are taking a strategic gamble that by 2020, they will be the worlds leading supplier of green technology. We see all this as a threat. Some of our industry associations are still stuck in the old mindset. They should see this (GT) as an opportunity.\u000a\u000aThey say as the West is in decline, the US thinks green investment is their only hope now.\u000a\u000aI dont write the epitaph for the US. The US remains the mightiest innovation engine of technology the world has ever seen and would continue to be in the frontier of technological innovation.The US has got the best scientific talent and technological environment. We can have creative partnerships with the US companies which could help Indian companies to emerge as world leaders, as has been shown in IT and mobile telephony. We have a large enough domestic market for us to be able to position ourselves internationally as well.\u000a\u000aOne criticism is that while China is investing hugely in technology of their own, India has not done much and we are not doing any strategic thinking.\u000a\u000aWe dont because all our thinking on climate change is dictated by international negotiations. We are called upon to do A, B or C by international negotiations. We never have had a strategic domestic agenda. This is a wrong approach we have taken. International negotiation is one of the important aspect of the issue but the more important is domestic strategic agenda and to implement it with a sense of seriousness both in the public and private sectors. You need people to think out of the box. You still have people who are more worried about square bracket and semi colons. There should be strategic domestic agenda to enable India to build this new green infrastructure and also acquire a global leadership role.\u000a\u000aTell us about Indias road map for low carbon growth.\u000a\u000aWe have set a working group under the chairmanship of Kirit Parikh. It has got a lot of think tanks, economists, engineers and they are looking at the 12th Five-Year Plan. We are committed to a low (carbon) growth development strategy for the 12th and 13th Plans. The Parikh group will prepare sectoral roadmaps for power, port, forest and agriculture.\u000a\u000aDo you think that we will compromise our strategic domestic thinking by giving assurance to the US that we will consult them on our national plan\u000a\u000aConsultation and analysis are part of our development activity. We have had trade consultations at the WTO. We have Article IV consultation with the IMF every year on fiscal and monetary policy. These have not eroded our sovereignty in any way. Consultation and analysis are different from scrutiny. We have a transparent system, whatever the government does is available in the public domain.\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Accord has been taken note of, but has not been adopted. What exactly is the differential\u000a\u000aIf it had been adopted, all the 194 countries would have adopted it. When it has been taken note of, only 29 countries are party to it. Other countries saw it but did not adopt it. Most countries did not have objections with the substance of the Copenhagen Accord. They had problems with the process of the Accord. The manner by which the Accord was arrived at was something that caused headaches to many countries.\u000a\u000aGoing forward, you are suggesting that our position will be closer to the BASIC group for a while\u000a\u000aIt is negotiating tactic. We are not on the same boat as China as far as emissions are concerned. But when the BASIC countries negotiate, we are a voice. That is a strength. Note that President Obama came to see us (during the Copenhagen summit) , we did not go to him. If Brazil, South Africa, India and China get together and their position converge, people would listen to them. Even as these countries have differences among them, they also have certain commonality of interests. Politics is driving us to come together.\u000a\u000a(To review the Copenhagen accord and also to plan for the future, the environment ministers of the four BASIC countries met here on Sunday).\u000a\u000aWill India also not sign a legally binding agreement in the future\u000a\u000aIndia is prepared to reflect its domestic commitment internationally in any form but a legally binding framework. The government will stick to this commitment.\u000a\u000aThere is a view that Copenhagen accord would not suffice for achieving the goal to limit global temperature increase to two degree Celsius (above the temperature when industrialisation began).\u000a\u000aWe are committed to this target (of limiting temperature increase to 2% by 2050), which we had agreed to even before Copenhagen. A more ambitious target would constrict Indias development space. Science is complex and evolving. There is a great deal of probability.\u000a\u000aBut one thing needs to be recognised is that global warming is a reality and we have to mount a creative response which is rooted in our interest, not as a response to the international negotiation.\u000a\u000aDo you think that the temperature can be reduced by two degree Celsius without the West reducing its consumption\u000a\u000aLifestyles have to change. Emission in the West is lifestyle-induced emission. By and large, emission in countries like India is developmental. We have a high emission segment in our society also. I think the Americans know this. I think that the buildings in America 10 years from now will be dramatically different. The innovation engine of America will definitely come up with some real discontinuities, which will drive costs down.\u000a\u000aDo you think that the coming Budget will reflect some of the Copenhagen commitments\u000a\u000aWithout commenting on the coming Budget, I would say the kinds of fiscal instruments for green economytax breaks, accelerated deprecation etc are parts of Budgets. Fiscal policy, procurement norms and regulations have very important roles to play in pushing for green technology. These are the issues which the Kirit Parikh Group would examine and would give us a report over the next year for the 12th Plan.\u000a\u000aFiscal policy has a major role to play in determining technological behaviour. Standards are crucial. For example, we should have mandatory fuel efficiency standards to automatically ensure that the transportation sector is efficient. Today the transportation sector accounts for 7-8% of greenhouse gas emissions, but it is reckoned that by the year 2020, the sector would account for anywhere between 15-20%.\u000a\u000aWill our political economy realistically allow initiatives that result in costlier power for larger masses\u000a\u000aThe per capita consumption of larger masses is so low that they are not going to be adding to the stock of greenhouse gases. The objective of fulfilling the power needs of 400 million people, whose requirements are basic, are built into the framework of 20-25% reduction in carbon emission intensity. There may be some parts (of India) where you cannot extend the grid system of electricity. There you have to have solar energy.\u000a\u000aYou said there is a huge opportunity of green trading and investment lies. That can only happen if the cost is affordable.\u000a\u000aThere is no doubt in my mind that in the next 15 years, costs are going to come down dramatically in the area of renewable energies. With the kind of investments Americans are making, it has to come down. Otherwise, how will America fulfill its target of reducing its emissions This is only by way of improving technology and technology will drive cost down.\u000a\u000aAre Indian businesses ready for what you are saying\u000a\u000aI think so. Tatas have already announced they will be carbon-neutral by a target year. Jamshed Godrej and Tata groups are the most advanced ones in the area of green investments. Im going to meet the Tata officials in early February. They are going to make a presentation about a strategy for the group to become carbon-neutral by a particular year. The new investments that are going to come are going to be at the cutting edge. They have to be at the cutting edge.\u000a\u000aDo you think that India can adopt the western pattern of consumption\u000a\u000aI dont think so. It will be a recipe for suicide.

a((VClimate change, or global warming, is the most controversial topic in the world today, and the debate shows no signs of calming down. Climate change scientists have become embroiled in a fresh controversy over a claim that\u000a\u000aHimalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. The claim was contained in a wide-ranging report produced in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body made up of the worlds leading climate change scientists that advises governments.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC published the following statement in its fourth assessment report: Glaciers in the Himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world and, if the present rate continues, the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate. The statement came nearly verbatim from an article published in Down to Earth on April 30, 1999. There were several problems with this piece. For example, it attributed the claim that that total glacier area would shrink from the present 5,00,000 to 1,00,000 square km by the year 2035 to former International Commission for Snow and Ice president VM Kotlyakov. But Kotlyakovs report had referred to all glaciers outside the polar regions (not just in the Himalayas) and more importantly it had referred to 2350not 2035. Further, Kotlyakovs report specifically said glaciers will survive in the Himalayas even then.\u000a\u000aClimate change scientists say the 2035 claim said was only a minor detail in a report that was thousands of pages long and drew on data from thousands of sources. The Himalayan claim was not included in the key document arising from the report, such as the summary for policymakers that was presented to governments to help them draft a response to the problem of global warming.\u000a\u000aFrom East Anglia to Sarah Palin\u000a\u000aBut the claim is another embarrassment for climate change scientists, who were already on the defensive after a series of e-mails were published late last year that appeared to show some scientists planning to refuse access to their data, and adjusting the presentation of their data to emphasise the dangers of climate change. The e-mails, hacked from the servers of the University of East Anglia, generated fierce criticism of the scientists just before the Copenhagen conference on climate change last December. Climate change sceptics argued that the leaked e-mails showed flaws in the practices of climate scientists, and damaged the credibility of their conclusions. Climate scientists responded that the e-mails were taken out of context, and did not show serious attempts to manipulate scientific conclusions.\u000a\u000aIn the US, a former vice-president and a former vice-presidential nominee have engaged in a public battle over climate change, a tiff sparked by Sarah Palins oped piece in the Washington Post and furthered by Al Gores rebuttal on MSNBC. The former Alaska governor charged that leading climate experts have destroyed records, manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures, and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Palin was referring to the University of East Anglia controversy. She wrote that she had personally witnessed the impact of changing weather patterns. But while we recognise the occurrence of these natural, cyclical environmental trends, we cant say with assurance that mans activities cause weather changes. Palin also took to Facebook to allege that concerns over global warming are doomsday scare tactics pushed by an environmental priesthood.\u000a\u000aGore rebutted that the scientific community has worked intensively on the issue for 20 years. Its a principle in physics Its like gravity, it exists.\u000a\u000aFurther back in history\u000a\u000aIts clear that the world was warmer during medieval times. By mapping the data published (all peer-reviewed) by 752 individual scientists from 442 separate research institutions across 41 different countries, and correlating their comparisons of temperatures changes since medieval times, after factoring in the fact that these studies use a range of ice cores, stalagmites, sediments and isotopes, we find that temperatures were about 0.5C warmer worldwide.\u000a\u000aPrior to IPCCs third assessment report of 2001, the accepted depiction of the prior millenniums warmth was that published in the panels 1990 maiden assessment global temperatures had fluctuated drastically over the period. And data derived from sources including tree-rings, lake sediments, ice cores and historical documents bear out that position. Indeed, its abundantly evident that since the last glacial period ended, over 14,000 years ago, the Earths climate has undergone multi-century swings from warming to cooling that occur often and with remarkable rapidity. And not one but three such radical shifts occurred within the past millennium.\u000a\u000aThe years 900-1300 AD have been labelled the Medieval Warming Period, as global temperatures rose precipitously from the bitter cold of the previous epochthe Dark Agesto levels several degrees warmer than today. A sudden period of cooling then followed and lasted until the year 1850. This Little Ice Age brought on extremely cold temperatures, corresponding with three periods of protracted solar inactivity, the lowest temperatures coinciding with the quietest of the three (The Maunder Minimum 1645-1710). And then began the modern warming period, which, by the way, many scientists believe ended with the millennium itself.\u000a\u000aGiven these natural shifts over the past 1,000 years, its certainly not surprising that after a period of cooling, which followed a period of warming, wed again enter a period of warming. And that, of course, presented quite the quandary to opportunists hell-bent on blaming warming on industrial revolution-triggered atmospheric CO2 increases. Something had to be done to convince the world that modern warming was unprecedented and could therefore only be explained by something unnatural, specifically the greenhouse effect. And something was indeed done.\u000a\u000aHockey stick graph and its wonders\u000a\u000aIn 1995 everyone agreed the world was warmer in medieval times, but CO2 was low then and that didnt fit with climate models. In 1998, suddenly Michael Mann ignored the other studies and produced a graph that scared the world (what infamously began to be known as the hockey stick graphtree rings showing that the 1990s was the hottest decade for a thousand years. Now temperatures exactly fit the rise in carbon! The IPCC used the graph all over their 2001 report. Government departments copied it. The media told everyone.\u000a\u000aThe chart is relatively flat from 1000 to 1900 AD, indicating that temperatures were relatively stable for this period of time. The flat part forms the sticks shaft. After 1900, however, temperatures appear to shoot up, forming the hockey sticks blade. The combination of the two in the chart suggests a recent sharp rise in temperature caused by human activities. But the graphs author, Michael Mann, was reluctant to provide his data or methodsnormally a basic requirement of any scientific paper. It took legal action to get the information that should have been freely available.\u000a\u000aWithin days, Steven McIntyre showed that the statistics were so flawed that you could feed in random data, like stock prices, and still make the same hockey stick shape nine times out of ten. Mann had left out some tree rings he said hed included. If someone did a graph like this in a red herring stock prospectus, he could invite legal action.\u000a\u000aIn the United Nations Environment Programmes Climate Change Science Compendium 2009, the eco-plea opens with the following words from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon: The science has become more irrevocable than ever: Climate change is happening. The evidence is all around us. And unless we act, we will see catastrophic consequences including rising sea levels, droughts and famine, and the loss of up to a third of the worlds plant and animal species. A striking chart in support of this argument attempts to plot atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mean global temperature during the past millennium. It looks vaguely familiar, because its Mr Hockey Stick againapparently having sat for a bit of a makeover.\u000a\u000aWhat if we confront the fact that temperatures were higher 1,000 years ago, and cooler 300 years ago. The Earth started warming long before cars and power stations were invented. Theres little correlation with CO2 levels. It is instructive to note that the mean temperature as of November 2009 is 0.5C above the baseline.\u000a\u000aSome believe mere graphic tricks are being used to fool people into believing in anthropogenic global warming. And facts suggest a steady long-term temperature rise that began long before the industrial era (late 20th century) that Warmists demonise.\u000a\u000aThe author is a Wharton Business School MBA and CEO, Global Money Investor

a((VSome aspects of may not be entirely understood and data may be sparse, but scientists do not dispute that global temperature has increased, especially since 1950, as pointed out in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u000a\u000aIndian scientists note the rise in the levels of the along three cities in the country are close to the global averages stated in the report.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe rate of warming averaged over the last 50 years is nearly twice that for the last 100 years,\u201d says the report, in its conclusions drawn from available studies and data and reviewed by a several scientists. A detailed reading of the report reveals, contrary to what the current glacier goof-up may indicate, the report gives clear assessments about where the understanding of science is robust and where it may need more data. The glacier goof-up is not part of the summary for policymakers, a synthesized part of the document, which is widely read across the globe by decision-makers.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo big fuss should be made (on the glacier issue),\u201d said J Srinivasan, chairman of Divecha Centre for Climate Change at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. \u201cAll modelling has some problems. Nations deal with it in their economic modelling. The overall science is well understood. is not a dramatic change, but a long-term change that will lead to serious consequences,\u201d Srinivasan said.\u000a\u000aThe impact on India alone will be serious. Ocean experts say the mean sea-level rise along the coasts of Mumbai, Kochi and Visakhapatnam is due to the effects of \u201cThe is rising by 1.3 mm every year,\u201d A S Unnikrishnan, senior scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography, told Business Standard.\u000a\u000aSrinivasan said glaciers, too, are retreating. People have measured them. \u201cLarge glaciers will be around, but the smaller ones are retreating,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFrom an analysis of 100 years of tide gauge data, Unnikrishnan and his team showed that sea levels along the coast of Mumbai, Kochi and Visakhapatnam rose by 0.78, 1.14 and 0.75 mm, respectively, per year. The data are close to the global average and could have serious implications for India\u2019s coastline.\u000a\u000aThe report points out that observations since 1961 show the average temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at least 3,000 metres and that the ocean has been absorbing more than 80 per cent of the heat added to the climate system. \u201cSuch warming causes seawater to expand, contributing to sea level rise,\u201d says the report. Experts point out the one issue that climate sceptics may have is that the report gives global averages. What may be true for one region may not apply to another, as it is only an average figure, they say.\u000a\u000aAssociate director at the Centre for Science and Environment Chandra Bhushan, says the report has already made a distinction between robust findings and uncertainties. The report provides a clear guideline for treatment of uncertainties. In fact, the fourth assessment report, provides, for the first time, an \u201cuncertainty guidance.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe authors distinguish the conclusions on the basis of \u201chigh confidence\u201d in which an event is unlikely or extremely likely.

a((VIt has been a bad two months for the purveyors of the \u201cscience\u201d of manmade The of countries (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) stood firm at from being bounced into an agreement on mandatory carbon emission cuts. With the Democrat\u2019s defeat in Massachusetts, there is little hope of President pursuing the US climate change Bill, leaving Europe \u2014 particularly the \u2014 out on a limb with their legislation of targets for savage cuts which, if implemented, will lead to their rapid descent into the Stone Age.\u000a\u000aBut an equally important drama has been playing in New Delhi with Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), having to retract various purportedly \u201cscientific\u201d claims made in the panel\u2019s 2007 report. The one which has rightly come to the fore in India is Glaciergate, concerning the IPCC\u2019s claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. When the government-sponsored report by eminent Indian glaciologist Dr Vijaya Raina came out in November, saying that the IPCC\u2019s claims were baseless and recklessly alarmist, it was dismissed by Dr Pachauri, a railway engineer with a PhD in economics, as being \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cvoodoo science\u201d. Subsequently, he had to eat crow as he and the had to admit that their predictions about Himalayan glaciers were without scientific foundations.\u000a\u000aGlaciergate had been preceded by Climategate in November, when a hacker leaked hundreds of emails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. These show that Professor Phillip Jones, the director of the \u2014 the source of the most important of the four sets of temperature data on which the relies \u2014 along with a tight network of colleagues had for years discussed various tactics to avoid releasing their data to outsiders under freedom of information laws. They kept coming up with innumerable excuses to conceal the background data on which their findings and temperature records are based. Jones, astonishingly, even claimed in 2008 that this data from all over the world was \u201clost\u201d. But the emails show that scientists were told to delete large chunks of data. As this was done after the receipt of a freedom of information request, it became a criminal offence, and the University of East Anglia had to agree to release the data in collaboration with the met office\u2019s Hadley Centre after obtaining the agreement of other met offices around the world.\u000a\u000aThe unwillingness to release the data was for two reasons. First, since 1977 when sunspot activity has decreased as the Sun seems to have gone to sleep, both terrestrial and more accurate satellite temperature readings show the Earth is cooling, even as CO2 emissions have increased (See fig. 1), contradicting the man-made theory. Second, they have been keen to resurrect the infamous \u201chockey stick\u201d.\u000a\u000aTill 1999, when a recent physics Phd- turned-climatologist, Michael Mann, published a paper on the 1,000-year temperature record, the accepted trend was given by fig. 2, which appeared in the 1990 report (reproduced in its Chairman John Houghton\u2019s book (1994)). This shows that temperatures in the Medieval Warm Period had been higher than those predicted to increase as a result of rising CO2 emissions. Mann and his colleagues (Nature, 1998:779-787) showed that, including data from Californian pine cones and with suitable statistical manipulation, the data was best represented by fig. 3, where the temperature was constant followed by a rapid rise with the Industrial Age. Their \u201chockey stick\u201d became the iconic figure in the 2001 IPCC report.\u000a\u000aTill two Canadians, statistician Stephen McIntyre and economist Ross McKitrick, published an article showing that \u201cthere was an error in a routine calculation step\u2026 that falsely identified a hockey stick shape as the dominant pattern in the data. The flawed computer program can even pull out spurious hockey stick shapes from lists of trendless random numbers\u201d (Energy and Environment, 2003:752-771).\u000a\u000aWith the subsequent furore, the US Congress set up two scientific committees to examine climate history. They upheld McIntyre and McKitrick, and one investigation chaired by Dr Edward Wegman \u2014 a leading statistician \u2014 excoriated the Mann papers as well as his various highly placed supporters who had tried to whitewash them. Wegman also commissioned a \u201csocial network analysis\u201d of Mann\u2019s defenders to find out how independent they were, which found that they \u201care closely connected and thus \u2018independent studies\u2019 may not be as independent as they might appear on the surface\u201d. Mann\u2019s supporters were \u201ca tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. However, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism, and, moreover, the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility\u201d. (Wegman Report, 2006 is available at gochttp://www.cimateaudit.org/pdf/others/07142006_Wegman_Report.pdf).\u000a\u000aThese revelations of the debauching of climate change \u201cscience\u201d by the IPCC continue apace. As I write, there is a report that the IPCC\u2019s 2007 claim that global warming is linked to a rise in natural disasters has also been shown to be scientifically invalid. The IPCC vice-chairman says it will be reviewed.\u000a\u000aThe unravelling of this politicised climate \u201cscience\u201d has already had political consequences. At the recent BASIC environmental ministers gathering, Xi Zhenhua, the Chinese representative, said that Beijing would keep an \u201copen attitude to the disputes in the scientific community\u201d as \u201cthere is a view that climate change is caused by cyclical trends in nature itself\u201d. As a start, to help in an honest resolution of these disputes, the IPCC needs to be disbanded. If necessary, by the BASIC countries withdrawing, and setting up a truly independent global scientific commission of scientists supporting the two alternative theories on global warming outlined in my previous Meanwhile, to end conning the media, Dr Pachauri should issue a statement that he not be referred to as the world\u2019s leading climate scientist. No more than Al Gore or me!

a((VWhether it is the blunder over the glaciers or the linking of natural disasters to global warming, the IPCC\u2019s credibility has been badly hit. If this encourages laxity over global warming, that will be tragic.\u000a\u000aChandra Bhushan\u000a\u000aAssociate Director, Centre for Science and Environment\u000a\u000aMost scientific papers agree that the Himalayan glaciers are receding \u2014 the goof-up shouldn\u2019t be used as a licence by big polluters to pollute\u000a\u000aClimate change deniers had a field day last week. A silly mistake in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report became yet another \u201cproof\u201d that climate change itself was a collective figment of the imagination of thousands of scientists, not to mention millions of people bearing the brunt of a changing climate.\u000a\u000aOn Himalayan glaciers, the (Chapter 10.6.2 of the Working Group-II) has clearly got it wrong by quoting a non-peer reviewed paper. Considering the science of climate change is still evolving (that is why the publishes its reports every six years, with clear segregation between robust findings and uncertainties), providing a definitive date is a goof-up. Yet, aren\u2019t Himalayan glaciers indeed receding?\u000a\u000aMost scientific papers available on this subject agree on the following:\u000a\u000aMost Himalayan glaciers under observation are retreating \u2014 some faster than others. Some haven\u2019t markedly retreated (reportedly, Siachen).\u000a\u000aSmaller glaciers are receding faster than bigger ones. Bigger glaciers are fragmenting.\u000a\u000aAll glaciers under observation show cumulative negative mass balance, melting faster than the ice accumulating in them.\u000a\u000aIn sum, there is hardly any report of a glacier showing a long-term advancing trend.\u000a\u000aThese findings are incontrovertible. They are in the 2009 Raina report, the one that Environment Minister released, and in a yet-to-be-published report of the Glaciers Study Group, prepared under the guidance of the Principal Scientific Advisor, government of India. But there\u2019s a difference. Whereas the Raina report says \u201cmany centuries of observations\u201d are required to link glacial retreat to climate change, the study group concludes, \u201cThis combination of glacial retreat, negative mass balance, early melting of seasonal snow cover and winter time increase in stream run-off suggest an influence of climate change on Himalayan Cryosphere.\u201d Glaciers will respond to natural processes, local and regional changes (deforestation, urbanisation, industrialisation) as well as global changes (increase in global temperature). Quantifying the distinct contribution of each is impossible. But to say rising temperature has no impact on Himalayan glaciers would be irresponsible. To, then, say global temperature is not rising because of human influence would be ludicrous.\u000a\u000aBear in mind that the science of is not under dispute (it is a simple science of greenhouse gas effects and changes in earth\u2019s energy balance); the observational evidence is. And there is lack of the latter because there isn\u2019t sufficient research on all aspects of and the changing dimensions of the climate system, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aWe need to know more about what is happening in India on climate change. We need funds and institutional capacity to drive such research. But this should not stop us from preparing ourselves for an eventuality: Glacier melting will impact the water regime of our glacier-fed rivers \u2014 more than 500 million people depend on these rivers. More crucially, this should not lead us to deny climate change. Healthy dispute is good for the advancement of science, denial is not.\u000a\u000aThis controversy around the IPCC report, if given more importance, will only strengthen the hands of the big global polluters. If there is any entrenched interest in climate change, it is that of the fossil fuel companies and the big global polluters, who would like to continue with business as usual. At Copenhagen, these polluters took no action. In fact, we joined their gang and became a party to their inaction by supporting the Copenhagen Accord. But, the spectre of legally binding targets still hasn\u2019t vanished for them. In this context, they would be very happy to encourage the kind of climate change scepticism they have unleashed since 1990, all over again (the 2007 IPCC fourth assessment report was a disaster for them). Indeed, the idea is to, once again, push for a complete denial of climate change.\u000a\u000aWe cannot allow this to happen.

a((VWhether it is the blunder over the glaciers or the linking of natural disasters to global warming, the IPCC\u2019s credibility has been badly hit. If this encourages laxity over global warming, that will be tragic.\u000a\u000aChandra Bhushan\u000a\u000aAssociate Director, Centre for Science and Environment\u000a\u000aMost scientific papers agree that the Himalayan glaciers are receding \u2014 the goof-up shouldn\u2019t be used as a licence by big polluters to pollute\u000a\u000aClimate change deniers had a field day last week. A silly mistake in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report became yet another \u201cproof\u201d that climate change itself was a collective figment of the imagination of thousands of scientists, not to mention millions of people bearing the brunt of a changing climate.\u000a\u000aOn Himalayan glaciers, the (Chapter 10.6.2 of the Working Group-II) has clearly got it wrong by quoting a non-peer reviewed paper. Considering the science of climate change is still evolving (that is why the publishes its reports every six years, with clear segregation between robust findings and uncertainties), providing a definitive date is a goof-up. Yet, aren\u2019t Himalayan glaciers indeed receding?\u000a\u000aMost scientific papers available on this subject agree on the following:\u000a\u000aMost Himalayan glaciers under observation are retreating \u2014 some faster than others. Some haven\u2019t markedly retreated (reportedly, Siachen).\u000a\u000aSmaller glaciers are receding faster than bigger ones. Bigger glaciers are fragmenting.\u000a\u000aAll glaciers under observation show cumulative negative mass balance, melting faster than the ice accumulating in them.\u000a\u000aIn sum, there is hardly any report of a glacier showing a long-term advancing trend.\u000a\u000aThese findings are incontrovertible. They are in the 2009 Raina report, the one that Environment Minister released, and in a yet-to-be-published report of the Glaciers Study Group, prepared under the guidance of the Principal Scientific Advisor, government of India. But there\u2019s a difference. Whereas the Raina report says \u201cmany centuries of observations\u201d are required to link glacial retreat to climate change, the study group concludes, \u201cThis combination of glacial retreat, negative mass balance, early melting of seasonal snow cover and winter time increase in stream run-off suggest an influence of climate change on Himalayan Cryosphere.\u201d Glaciers will respond to natural processes, local and regional changes (deforestation, urbanisation, industrialisation) as well as global changes (increase in global temperature). Quantifying the distinct contribution of each is impossible. But to say rising temperature has no impact on Himalayan glaciers would be irresponsible. To, then, say global temperature is not rising because of human influence would be ludicrous.\u000a\u000aBear in mind that the science of is not under dispute (it is a simple science of greenhouse gas effects and changes in earth\u2019s energy balance); the observational evidence is. And there is lack of the latter because there isn\u2019t sufficient research on all aspects of and the changing dimensions of the climate system, especially in developing countries.\u000a\u000aWe need to know more about what is happening in India on climate change. We need funds and institutional capacity to drive such research. But this should not stop us from preparing ourselves for an eventuality: Glacier melting will impact the water regime of our glacier-fed rivers \u2014 more than 500 million people depend on these rivers. More crucially, this should not lead us to deny climate change. Healthy dispute is good for the advancement of science, denial is not.\u000a\u000aThis controversy around the IPCC report, if given more importance, will only strengthen the hands of the big global polluters. If there is any entrenched interest in climate change, it is that of the fossil fuel companies and the big global polluters, who would like to continue with business as usual. At Copenhagen, these polluters took no action. In fact, we joined their gang and became a party to their inaction by supporting the Copenhagen Accord. But, the spectre of legally binding targets still hasn\u2019t vanished for them. In this context, they would be very happy to encourage the kind of climate change scepticism they have unleashed since 1990, all over again (the 2007 IPCC fourth assessment report was a disaster for them). Indeed, the idea is to, once again, push for a complete denial of climate change.\u000a\u000aWe cannot allow this to happen. The media has found its first post-Copenhagen crisis, but its reportage should not enthuse climate sceptics; its enthusiasm in tripping up the IPCC report should not become grist to the climate change-denying mill. After all, the principal climate change deniers are in the US, the UK and Australia \u2014 the big polluters.

India\u2019s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, when asked if the Accord would become a legal document, said: \u201cThere is no hope\u201d.\u000a\u000aThey hoped this would facilitate the two-track process of negotiations under the Bali road map to lead to a successful conclusion of ongoing negotiations in Mexico.

But, he said, \u201cwe will not just keep crying but act in a unified way,\u201d referring to the possibility of setting up a climate fund.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact that BASIC is able to do this, despite not being historically responsible, is a strong position.\u201d He said BASIC countries will provide technological support to LDCs. \u201cThis is a slap in the face of the rich countries which are better placed to do so,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aRamesh said they had discussed ways to support different projects. \u201cEach of us has an assistance programme. But, we discussed it as a collective entity. There has been no conclusion.

a((VIn this concluding part of his extended interview to Business Standard, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh talks of his agenda for greening Indian industry: new energy efficiency norms for industry, applying a new environment index at industrial clusters, and the like. Excerpts\u000a\u000aWhat is the scope of your green plan for industry?\u000a\u000aThe big thing we are awaiting is the national energy efficiency mission, which we have announced. The amendments to the are now awaiting parliamentary approval. We are introducing a market-based mechanism for energy efficiency \u2014 a cap and trade system, so to speak. In nine energy-intensive industries, like cement, fertiliser and refineries, the best-practice energy consumption norms are stipulated. An energy-efficiency certificate is to be introduced, as a legal sort of tender, mandated under the Say there\u2019s a company meeting these standards by a substantial amount and there are companies well above the standards by a substantive amount. You create an internal market for trade in the certificate.\u000a\u000aThere is an auditing issue here, because there is no reliable way of auditing who meets the norms.\u000a\u000aThere are 714 energy-intensive units for which we will have the norms set. It\u2019s a new era we are entering. To my mind, it is the only system which will work. We are not a country where you can close down units.\u000a\u000aInternationally, the carbon trading thing is no longer seen as such a great idea.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is not carbon trading. The metric is not carbon emissions. The metric is energy consumption. This is a big step forward that we\u2019ve taken. The Bill has been introduced, the amendments are there. I expect by the end of the Budget session these amendments will be passed. By the middle of the year, the whole process of creating market-based mechanisms will fall into place.\u000a\u000aTell us about these industrial clusters that you have rated on environmental quality.\u000a\u000aWe got IIT Delhi and some other independent institutions to study where we are on environmental quality in 88 clusters. We looked at air pollution, water pollution and land pollution. Based on the results, we devised a Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index, which we will update every year.\u000a\u000aThe second part is to devise intervention. There has been a failure on the part of to monitor environmental quality. The infrastructure has not kept pace with industrial expansion. I have been to Vapi and Ankleshwar, which are the most polluted clusters. A simple thing like the drainage system has not kept pace with the expansion. Units have proliferated, but the basic infrastructure provided for in the mid-60s and 70s has not expanded. What you see in Vapi is red-colour effluent getting into the soil or municipal drains. It is a complete failure of environmental management.\u000a\u000aWhat corrective steps are you taking?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve had a chat with the finance minister. I said the primary responsibility of environmental management in these clusters is of private industry. However, there are many cases in which you will need common service facilities. You will require infrastructure facilities. I suggested we create a financial corpus \u2013 Rs 500 crore to begin with. This money from the Centre will stimulate state governments to participate, industry to participate, banks and financial institutions to participate. It is the Centre that seems to be more concerned with the environment than states. States are more concerned with growth, investment and employment.\u000a\u000aWhat about the plans to encourage green buildings?\u000a\u000aBuildings will be a very important contributor to our emissions. If you see the modern service economy, it is turning out to be as energy-intensive as conventional manufacturing. That is because of the way buildings have been designed. In the United States, the building sector is responsible for 35 to 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. We are not in that league as yet. As the service economy modernises, as urbanisation increases, as per capita income goes up, as prices of ACs fall, we will be in a situation where the building sector will play a very important role.\u000a\u000aThe most important thing is to have codes that are best practice in terms of energy consumption and emissions. We have introduced codes called the GRAHA. There is an international code called LEAD. India\u2019s most efficient (from an emissions point of view) public building will be the new ministry of external affairs, which will be commissioned by June. Our ministry\u2019s own office building, which will be commissioned by November 2011, will reduce energy consumption by 50 to 60 percent. There are similar buildings in Gurgaon \u2013 the Wipro office building, the ITC building, the Teri University. The bulk of the construction activity in states is in municipal building codes. If we are able to show what can be done at the Central level, the demonstration effect of these buildings will ensure that private buildings that get permission under various energy codes will also be energy compliant.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t such buildings raise costs?\u000a\u000aFor our building, we are looking at Rs 100 crore. What it would have cost had we not taken in all these features, that exercise we have not done, though it would be an interesting exercise. What the corpus will do is to fund activities such as a common effluent treatment plant.\u000a\u000aWith all that you are planning, will you reach your emission reduction targets?\u000a\u000aWith our eyes closed, we will reach 20 per cent. Many of these actions are in various stages of implementation. I expect the low carbon economy group to come up with a few more suggestions. We have many studies to show we can do better.\u000a\u000aYou have said that India has no data on emissions intensity beyond 1994. If so, what is the basis for your targets?\u000a\u000aWe have internationally-used data. The only source of comparable data is either Energy Administration of the US or the International Energy Agency in Paris. They use our Economic Survey and sectoral surveys and calculate.\u000a\u000aWhy don\u2019t we have our own data beyond 1994?\u000a\u000aOur whole approach to climate change has been dictated by international negotiations. Our mindset is, does the UNFCCC demand it? By May of this year, we will have an emissions inventory for 2007. The ballpark numbers will not change. From then, we will keep updating once in two years.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese are now among the top solar companies. Can you explain this, and where do we stand?\u000a\u000aOf the top 10 solar companies, four are already Chinese. China has strategically decided that they want to be world leaders in green technology by 2020. China has 12,000 Mw of wind-based energy, whereas India has 8,000 Mw. Five years ago, India was ahead of China. The Chinese are selling super-critical technology for coal-based power generation. The Chinese have grasped this as a strategic opportunity. Japan is also trying to recover the technological leadership that it lost in the 80s. They are also betting in a big way on green technology. It\u2019s not the United States, but Japan and China that will be the drivers of technology on coal-based power, wind, solar energy.\u000a\u000a(The earlier parts of this interview were published on January 15 and 16)

What did you gain by allowing Annex I countries to dilute the\u000a\u000aThey have not diluted Kyoto. The two largest emitters are not part of Kyoto. Let\u2019s understand that 45 per cent of the world\u2019s emissions are accounted for by two countries (China and the US), who are not part of Kyoto.\u000a\u000aOne outcome of was that negotiations under Kyoto will continue for the second commitment period. But the fact is, Kyoto is in intensive care. Most countries want to get out of Kyoto. The desire of the international community is to bring China into an international agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. What the Europeans are saying is, we will not take commitments under Kyoto because the Americans are not doing it; and the Americans are saying we will not take commitments because the Chinese are doing it. To that extent, we are in a bit of a quandary. We have not killed Kyoto. We have bought time.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s assume it is dead\u2026\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s facing a grave crisis. No question about it. The second commitment period is under question because of structural reasons, because of questions being raised on the US, and in the US questions being raised on China. What we got in was the mandate to continue the negotiations on that. Then we got the Copenhagen accord. Twenty-nine countries negotiated this accord.\u000a\u000aWhat did India gain by aligning with China?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOur alignment was strategic. It goes beyond climate change. Within the climate change issue, it was India that helped bring transparency on to the agenda; and by bringing transparency on to the agenda, actually the pressure is on China to do a much better job on what it is doing \u2014 making it transparent. Frankly, it (China\u2019s) is a very opaque system. For example, day before yesterday, the chief negotiator was shifted.\u000a\u000aThe criticism is that, after Copenhagen, the 2 degree limit on global warming is impossible to achieve. It will go well beyond that limit. And since India is among the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change, basically, you\u2019ve killed yourself.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a no-win situation. There was pressure on us to agree to a 1.5 degree limit \u2014 Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan \u2014 all wanted that. We cannot agree to that. That will further constrict our development space. Even the 2 degrees \u2014 today we are 380 parts per million, it goes to 450. How much is going to be attributable to growth from India? We don\u2019t know. There is no international framework for sharing.\u000a\u000aWhat you are saying is that the 2 degree cap will not work?\u000a\u000aNo, what we are saying is we\u2019ve agreed to a 2 degree cap by 2050. That was not at Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aBy killing Kyoto, you knocked out the 2 degree limit. If you are going to be one of the early victims of global warming, it will be a disservice to India to have let Annex I countries off the hook.\u000a\u000aThe best service to India is to agree to a 1.5 degree limit. But India has multiple objectives. India has its objective of ensuring its vulnerability gets minimised. Its objective is to preserve its development space for 9 per cent growth. If I had gone with purely environmental objectives, I would have perhaps taken a different stance. I did not go with a pure environmental objective.\u000a\u000aHow will we keep development space if we come under international scrutiny?\u000a\u000aThis is a bogus argument. India has been under international scrutiny for the last 55 to 60 years. We are quite adept at handling ourselves internationally. We do Article IV consultations with the IMF. We do trade policy discussions with the WTO. In fact, our trade liberalisation autonomously has been far more aggressive than what we have committed to under WTO. The IMF comes and produces a fiscal and monetary policy assessment. Has our sovereignty been eroded? Just because we have consultation and analysis (that\u2019s the word, not scrutiny)?\u000a\u000aI have said from day one that we have nothing to hide. We are quite willing to have consultations, I\u2019m quite willing to put up every year a climate policy statement of the Government of India. I\u2019ll discuss it with whoever you want. How will sovereignty get eroded because of that?\u000a\u000aWhat did we get in return for shifting our negotiating position?\u000a\u000aFirst, we did not shift, we negotiated our position. On the global goal, we got what we wanted. We went to Copenhagen with the express objective of having a global goal in terms of an increase limited to 2 degrees Celsius. Nothing more.\u000a\u000aWe didn\u2019t want a 50 per cent cut in global emissions. We didn\u2019t want a PPM (parts per million) goal. We wanted a temperature goal. We got that. We didn\u2019t want the Copenhagen accord to be a legally binding treaty. We got that.\u000a\u000aIt is an operational document, so it is binding, de facto.\u000a\u000aIt is not a legally binding document. The Americans themselves don\u2019t want a legally binding document. It is an operational document.\u000a\u000aYou set out to change the agenda before you went to Copenhagen. The picture the government presented in the run-up to the meeting was of speaking in different languages, then the negotiators were on strike.\u000a\u000aWe are an argumentative society. We allow a multiplicity of opinions. We are a democracy at work. We have diversity at work. Ultimately, what is it that the PM wants.\u000a\u000aSince you are leading the effort, did you not discuss and get a consensus before you took a formal position?\u000a\u000aIf Dr Manmohan Singh had gone for consensus in 1991, would we have got economic reforms?\u000a\u000aSo, you did not get a consensus?\u000a\u000aBut I did not do anything by stealth. I said whatever I had to say in Parliament. I said, when I was asked, \u2018Have you shifted from the position,\u2019 I said yes. I had said we would have our domestic obligations subject to international information. I said it had changed to international consultation and analysis. Yes, it\u2019s changed. There is no big loss to national sovereignty.\u000a\u000aYou also took the position that we don\u2019t need the money, whereas under Kyoto the money was supposed to come?\u000a\u000aWho will give us public money? Nobody will. We are the world\u2019s fourth largest economy, the second fastest growing economy, and the world will give us money? Let us be realistic.\u000a\u000aThere was supposed to be a transfer of technology, too.\u000a\u000aWho is going to transfer technology? Why would they transfer technology? That was under UNFCCC (the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in 1992, when China was nowhere on the horizon as a greenhouse gas emitter, and India\u2019s 8 per cent growth was a dream. Things have changed. We are not junking UNFCCC. In Copenhagen, after a long time, India was seen to be pro-solution in the debate.

This is shown by a recent study on electricity conservation potential in the country, commissioned by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and conducted by the\u000a\u000aThe study shows that the total energy saving potential in the 35 states and Union territories of India is 75,360 million units (MU), while the overall energy deficit is lesser, at 73,090 MU. This is based on data for the financial year 2007-08.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough the study is based on the 2007-08 data, the trends underlying the energy saving potential and the deficit remain the same even today. The broad conclusions of the study remain valid,\u201d Director General told Business Standard.\u000a\u000aThe biggest energy saving potential is in Andhra Pradesh. The study shows this potential at 8,209 MU in 2007-08, which is over three times the energy deficit of 2,628 MU in the state.\u000a\u000aBulk of these energy savings could be achieved by simply moving to more energy efficient agricultural pumpsets.\u000a\u000aOverall energy saving possible by moving to more efficient pumpsets across the country is 27,790 MU, which is almost 40 per cent of the total saving potential. Andhra Pradesh, in fact, has the highest saving potential as far as pumpsets are concerned, followed by Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\u000a\u000aEnergy saving potential is also significant in the domestic sector, as well as in small-scale companies and large industries. On average, electricity saving potential in India is estimated at 15 per cent of consumption, on a conservative basis, the studys says. The other states where savings potential is far in excess of the deficit include Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal. The power ministry is hopeful that this study will excite the states and get them to act on energy efficiency initiatives.\u000a\u000aEnergy Efficiency is one of the eight missions under India\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).

a((VMinister of State for Environment and Forests said India will forward its domestic goals on climate change as its action plan under the Copenhagen Accord to the (COP) of the (UNFCCC). Under the Accord, nations have to submit their action plans by January 31.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a national action plan on climate change. We have announced that we will reduce emission intensity by 20-25 per cent on 2005 levels and that we will have a low carbon growth strategy,\u201d Ramesh said in an exclusive interview to Business Standard. \u201cThere are no new announcements to be made.\u201d\u000a\u000aCritics, however, caution that India could come under international scrutiny if it takes its domestic measures to the international community. It would need to be seen if this would imply a point-by-point review of India\u2019s development plans by the international community.\u000a\u000aThere are several roadblocks to cross before the Accord can be operationalised. One of India\u2019s negotiators at this climate change meeting, Prodipto Ghosh, said the Accord was negotiated outside the UN conference agenda, and only noted, not accepted by the Conference; it is not clear how it would be operationalised.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis has to be approved by all member-countries for it to be an outcome under the UNFCCC. So far, it has not been accepted by COP, so the question of its relationship to the UNFCCC is unclear,\u201d said Ghosh, a former Union secretary in the ministry of environment and forests.\u000a\u000aRamesh said he had written to his three counterparts in the (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) group to have a meeting in New Delhi in the third week of January before \u201ceveryone finalises the entry into the appendix\u201d. He agreed there were challenges ahead. \u201cThe main challenge is that an agreement by 29 countries needs to be converted into one by 194 countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aMainstreaming the Accord will be a big challenge, he said. \u201cThe big challenge is to mainstream the Accord and ensure that it facilitates the two-track process. The Copenhagen Accord is no substitute for the UNFCCC and a lot of discussions are happening in this regard. \u201d\u000a\u000aDomestically, Ramesh said, several actions have been taken. The Planning Commission will soon announce the constitution of an expert group to look at low-carbon growth strategies. By end-May, India will have an emissions inventory as well. \u201cToday, the latest year for official data on emissions is 1994.\u201d An (INCCA) has been set up.\u000a\u000aINCCA, a network-based programme will segment India into four sectors of agriculture, water resources, biodiversity and health. It will also divide the country into the Himalayan ecosystem, Western Ghats, coastal areas and the North East. INCCA will submit its first assessment report by November this year.

a((VAs I visited the last fortnight, one thing came home to me: The country has very little political will to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Policy-makers and media professionals talk about the climate change crisis. But any on cutting emissions, based on historical or even current responsibility, is just dismissed. The public perception, seemingly carefully nurtured, is that it is runaway pollution in and that will devastate the world. Indeed, any talk about serious action by the is hushed up, for it will mean playing into the hands of the Republicans. You are then sternly reminded that President is better than his predecessor, George Bush, on climate change. In other words, it is the responsibility of the world to now support his weak and meaningless actions. Else, the likes of Bush will be back. Talk about being held to ransom.\u000a\u000aCurrently, just to bring the reluctant on board, the world is being asked to agree on the accord, literally a polluter\u2019s manual. With no targets for industrialised countries to cut emissions, it seriously undermines the world\u2019s fight against climate change. Under the accord, how much each country must reduce its emissions by is not based on historical and current emissions. It is self-chosen, voluntary; never mind if it adds up to nothing. The US has offered some 3 per cent reduction below what it emitted in 1990 \u2014 what is required of it is 40 per cent below 1990 levels. Add up all the current pledges and the world is on course for at least 3°C rise in temperature, says the UN itself.\u000a\u000aYet, according to US chief climate negotiator Todd Stern, the accord is really clever: \u201cYou cannot underestimate the importance of a breach in the firewall between developed and developing countries\u201d. The \u201cbreach\u201d is that India, and all others have to pledge what they will do to cut emissions (although in a separate schedule). Everyone is now part of the global deal to cut emissions. This in itself is not a bad idea. But the fact is our entry facilitates a process to wipe out the principle that action must be taken on the basis of equity \u2014 country targets apportioned on the basis of historical and current contributions. The accord, if it becomes the framework for future negotiations, will simply overwrite the principle of equity in burden-sharing.\u000a\u000aThe move also implies that once past responsibility is erased, industrialised nations will have no obligation to pay for the transition in the developing world or provide technology on favourable terms.\u000a\u000aThe burden of transition has already shifted. The UN\u2019s own estimate is that, based on the stated pledges of different countries, developing countries will cut double what Annex 1 countries will do by 2020.\u000a\u000aBluntly, the accord divides the world into \u201cpolluters\u201d and \u201cbeggars\u201d. China, India, South Africa, Brazil and the like are being promised the right to pollute if they legitimise the right of the US and the rest to pollute. The rest of the world, small polluters and the like, apparently hungry for money, are promised funds for compliance. Remember how, the last night of COP15, the US and the UK openly told the Maldives and Bangladesh that they would not get money if the accord was not operationalised because of the intransigence of big developing countries. There is just no clarity on where this money will come from, and when. Fictional money, riding on a dishonest bribe.\u000a\u000aBut let\u2019s return to the US. Will this strategy work? Has the world stooped low enough?\u000a\u000aNot enough, I suspect. Last week, the Democratic party lost a crucial seat \u2014 Ted Kennedy\u2019s constituency of Massachusetts \u2014 to the Republican party. With this, they lost their majority in the House. There\u2019s more excuse to do less. Already, talk (in the power-media corridors) goes that the present Boxer-Kerry Bill, which sets out these weak targets, will not go through the Senate. It is even said the Bill, being recast as an energy-efficiency law, will be even weaker (if that is possible) than what\u2019s on the table.\u000a\u000aIn short, the world will have destroyed its blueprint for effective action on climate change all for the US, which will still renege and ask for even more. This is not new. In 1992 (the climate treaty), 1997 (the Protocol) and 2007 (the Bali Action Plan), all ambitions were whittled down, stuffed with loopholes and made inconsequential, all to suit the US. Still, the US walked out. How low will the race to the bottom take us now?\u000a\u000aThe news is not good. For instance, the US government has written to the World Bank saying it must not fund coal-based power stations in the developing world. Based on these \u201cinstructions\u201d, the first such project, in Pakistan, has been cancelled. But the US goes ahead with its plants.\u000a\u000aSo, how will the world deal with the US? That is the zillion-dollar climate question.

The report, based on new data from the International Energy Agency, went on to add that while China had been expected to do this sometime in the next five years, it did so in 2009 itself because of the recession in the US. The latter, however, remains the world\u2019s biggest per capita energy consumer, and also the biggest consumer of oil. Much of China\u2019s energy, just like much of India\u2019s, is generated from coal. China also happens to be the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aFrom a geopolitical perspective, China\u2019s growing hunger for energy should worry India. Both countries import much of their fuel requirements and the rising demand in China for fuel is bound to create ripples, if not waves, in the global energy markets. More worryingly, it will mean more competition between India and China to acquire energy assets in other countries\u2014something in which China has had far more success than India. The Journal report did not put a number to India\u2019s energy consumption, but the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010 puts it at 469 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2009, compared with China\u2019s 2,252 million tonnes.\u000a\u000aBut there is another, far more critical, aspect to China\u2019s numbers\u2014one concerning the environment. Multilateral environment talks have typically come unstuck because of the widely differing positions of the US, on the one side, and developing countries including India and China, on the other. The much-hyped Copenhagen talks held last year failed largely on this count and this is also the reason why most analysts and experts do not expect much from the Cancun climate talks scheduled for November.\u000a\u000aChina has sought to take a leadership position in the talks, which is understandable given its status as both the world\u2019s biggest consumer of energy as well as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. The Chinese government recently announced that it would host a discussion in Tianjin in October, as a run-up to the Cancun talks. Being present on the Chinese side of the table is sure to give India\u2019s position in the talks some heft. Still, India, which has simultaneously sought to take the high ground in environmental issues by announcing its own ambitious action plan to combat climate change, will do well to remember that China, like any right-minded nation, has always been guided by self-interest. India will have to do the same: compete with China for resources, even as it collaborates with its neighbour to arrive at what the two countries see as an equitable climate deal.\u000a\u000aShould China\u2019s needs affect India\u2019s energy outlook?

a((VChina has added yet another accomplishment to its mantelthe International Energy Agency has rated the country the worlds largest energy consumer. It now exceeds the USs level of energy consumption by a little over 4%, as measured in million tonnes of oil equivalents, a rating strongly contested by China. The Chinese refute this claim saying the figures overstate their consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. They maintain that the economy increasingly uses more energy efficient methods, while continuing to increase the share of renewable sources of energy in their total consumption.\u000a\u000aHowever, the debate on figures is irrelevant. Without Chinas growing appetite for energy, oil prices would be much lower, spurring higher consumptionespecially since the world is still in recovery mode. And besides, if not this year, China will have overtaken the US by next year or the year after. A word of cautionsince the US is still recovering from a severe economic downturn, the countrys energy consumption is still 20% below its all-time high, causing somewhat of a base effect.\u000a\u000aWhat emerges from this debate, besides Chinas galloping growth rate despite cooling measures, is the shift in the trend of energy consumption. Non-OECD Asia, the Middle East and Latin America will now fuel world oil demand through rising economic growth. Thus, it is projected that the emerging countries appetite for oil is large enough to negate the drop in developed countries demand. Levels of energy consumption are considered a benchmark for economic growth and the worlds oil reserves are not sufficient to sustain the current rates of expansion.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, although both China and Indias overall consumption of energy is very high, their per capita figures are still far below that of the US. Thus, there is only one direction in which to moveupwardsimplying that the energy needs of developing countries is only set to increase. Given this data and that both China and India are yet importers of oil, it is all the more imperative for the countries to explore alternative sources of energy. While China still depends on coal for over 70% of its energy needs, it has set a target of obtaining 15% of its energy from renewable sources. However, given the rates of expansion, dependence on non-renewable sources will continue to pose a threat to not only growth but also the environment and must steadily be replaced with greener sources.\u000a\u000afeedit@expressindia.com

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe spectre of global warming has generated some rather novel emergency fix-it proposals to stave off solar radiation from reaching the Earth. These include placing mirrors in space to reflect sunlight, injecting sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere and other such techniques of geo-engineering to manipulate the environment.\u000a\u000aA research article by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), in collaboration with the Carnegie Institution, Stanford University, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) -Ames, California, has established that the most sustainable geo-engineering option is to increase the reflectivity of low marine clouds by seeding them with tiny condensation nuclei. These reflective clouds reduce the solar radiation reaching earth, thereby keeping the planet cooler.\u000a\u000aSeeding low marine clouds (found off the west coasts of continents) even increases rainfall, says the research paper on the \u201cEnhancement of Marine Clouds.\u201d The lead author is G. Bala of the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Science and the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc. The study is published in the latest issue of the international journal Climate Dynamics.\u000a\u000a\u201cClouds reflect sunlight and cool the planet... If the number of droplets in clouds is increased, the reflectivity increases. This is the basic mechanism behind the proposal for whitening marine clouds to counteract global warming,\u201d said Professor Bala.\u000a\u000aSalt as seeds\u000a\u000aMarine cloud droplets can be increased by spraying tiny droplets of seawater into the marine atmosphere. \u201cThe salt particles in seawater serve as seeds for many tiny cloud droplets,\u201d Professor Bala explained.\u000a\u000aScientists used a computer simulation of the global climate system in which atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were set at approximately twice that of present-day levels. Cloud droplets over the oceans in the model were reduced to make the clouds more reflective, while clouds over land were unaltered. As expected, the marine clouds reflected more solar radiation and offset the warming effect of the high carbon dioxide levels.

Photo: AP\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate has postponed action on overhauling climate and energy policy, the chamber\u2019s top Democrat said Thursday, proposing a much scaled-back version in its place.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it was \u201cterribly disappointing\u201d to put off action on climate change, but the Democratic Party had to be realistic that conservative political opposition meant \u201cwe don\u2019t have the votes\u201d to pass a broad bill.\u000a\u000aLawmakers would instead consider a less ambitious initiative that seeks to learn some lessons from BP\u2019s massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and adopt a smaller number of incentives for natural gas and improving energy efficiency.\u000a\u000aThe BP and energy legislation marked \u201ca step forward, a small step, but very, very important.\u201d The limited bill had wide support and could be considered by the Senate as early as next week.\u000a\u000aThe postponement of broader climate action further undercuts US President Barack Obama\u2019s pledge to the international community to adopt far-reaching cuts to greenhouse-gas emissions that are blamed for global warming.\u000a\u000aMr. Obama has made climate legislation one of his top domestic priorities and proposed at last year\u2019s Copenhagen climate summit to cut US emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aThe delay was condemned by environmental groups. Mr. Reid \u201ctoday delivered very bad news to the American people,\u201d said David Hawkins of the Washington-based Natural Resources Defence Council. He urged the public to put more pressure on senators during a summer recess.\u000a\u000aThe White House insisted it has not given up on a more ambitious package of reforms. Carol Browner, the White House\u2019s top climate advisor, said the administration would in the meantime use its existing powers to further limit pollution from U.S. companies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has made clear ... that we need to have a comprehensive energy policy for this country,\u201d said Browner, who joined a press conference on Capitol Hill with Reid.\u000a\u000aMandatory caps on climate-damaging emissions have been opposed by Republicans as a painful tax on an already-struggling economy. Some Democrats from coal-producing states such as West Virginia have also been wary of the effort.\u000a\u000aDemocrats and the White House insisted their years-long efforts to pass a climate bill remained alive, but would not offer a new timeline for its passage. A bill before mid-term congressional elections set for November appeared unlikely.\u000a\u000aA climate bill would be presented to the Senate \u201cas soon as possible, whenever that might turn out to be,\u201d said Democratic Senator John Kerry, who has led talks on a comprehensive bill.

a((VWhen I first heard on Thursday that Democrats in the US Senate were abandoning the effort to pass an energy/climate bill that would begin to cap greenhouse gases that cause global warming and promote renewable energy that could diminish our addiction to oil, I remembered something that Joe Romm, the climateprogress.org blogger, once said: The best thing about improvements in health care is that all the climate change deniers are now going to live long enough to see how wrong they were.\u000a\u000aAlas, so are the rest of us. I could blame Republicans for the fact that not one GOP senator indicated a willingness to vote for a bill that would put the slightest price on carbon. I could blame the Democratic senators who were also waffling. I could blame President Obama for his disappearing act on energy and spending more time reading the polls than changing the polls. I could blame the Chamber of Commerce and the fossil-fuel lobby for spending bags of money to subvert this bill. But the truth is, the public, confused and stressed by the last two years, never got mobilised to press for this legislation. We will regret it.\u000a\u000aWe've basically decided to keep pumping greenhouse gases into Mother Nature's operating system and take our chances that the results will be benign \u2014 even though a vast majority of scientists warn that this will not be so. Fasten your seat belts. You cannot sweet-talk Mother Nature. You cannot spin her. You cannot tell her that the oil companies say climate change is a hoax. No, Mother Nature is going to do whatever chemistry, biology and physics dictate. Do not mess with Mother Nature. But that is just what we're doing.\u000a\u000aSince I don't have anything else to say, I will just fill out this column with a few news stories and emails that came across my desk in the past few days:\u000a\u000an Just as the US Senate was abandoning plans for a US cap-and-trade system, this article ran in The China Daily: "BEIJING \u2014 The country is set to begin domestic carbon trading programs during its 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-2015) to help it meet its 2020 carbon intensity target. ... Putting a price on carbon is a crucial step."\u000a\u000an As we East Coasters know, it's been extremely hot here this summer, with records broken. But, hey, you could be living in Russia, where ABC News recently reported that a "heat wave, which has lasted for weeks, has Russia suffering its worst drought in 130 years." The BBC reported that to keep cool "at lakes and rivers around Moscow, groups of revellers can be seen knocking back vodka and then plunging into the water. The result is predictable \u2014 233 people have drowned in the last week alone."\u000a\u000an A day before the climate bill went down, the CEO of one of the nation's biggest utilities e-mailed to say that if the Senate would set a price on carbon and requirements for renewal energy, utilities like his would have the price certainty they need to make the big next-generation investments, including nuclear.\u000a\u000an The last word goes to the contrarian hedge fund manager Jeremy Grantham, who in his July letter to investors, noted: "Conspiracy theorists claim to believe that global warming is a carefully constructed hoax driven by scientists desperate for ... what? Being needled by nonscientific newspaper reports, by blogs and by right-wing politicians and think tanks? I have a much simpler but plausible 'conspiracy theory': the fossil energy companies, driven by the need to protect hundreds of billions of dollars of profits, encourage obfuscation of the inconvenient scientific results.

a((VPUNE: Solar lanterns provided to villages where access to electricity is absent or minimal, as part of The Energy and Resources Institute 's ( TERI ) ' Lighting a Billion Lives ' (LaBL) programme, are now customised for rural lighting and come at a low cost.Akansha Chaurey, director, Decentralized Energy Solutions, and head of the LaBL programme said that the programme had been aiming at bringing down the cost, while enhancing their performance.LaBL is being implemented in nine villages in the districts of Ahmednagar, Amravati and Raigad. "Maharashtra comes in the priority list and the programme will be implemented in 12 more villages in Amravati and Ahmednagar districts by August this year. The idea is to replace kerosene and paraffin lanterns with solar lighting devices," she said.According to Chaurey, solar lanterns have proved to be a clean, reliable and versatile source of lighting. "At present, we have customised the lanterns for rural lighting," she said. Earlier, a lantern used to cost Rs 2,200 to Rs 3,000. With the new technology, it will cost around Rs 995 to 1,600.On Friday, TERI launched five categories of lanterns based on LEDS (light emitting diodes) that are tested in-house and are ready to be used in rural lighting initiatives. Three hamlets in Barshet, Belachiwadi and Hondawadi from the Alibaug block in Raigad district, which do not have access to electricity, are using these lanterns.Jayant Sarnaik, deputy director of NGO Applied Environmental Research Foundation (AERF), who is also the implementing partner of the LaBL programme in Maharashtra, said: "This technology is easy to install and economically viable. One has to pay just Rs 2 per day for using this lantern, which is used as maintenance cost. Solar lanterns are recharged at a village solar charging station and rented out to them.""TERI pays 60 per cent of the cost and the rest is co-financed by AERF and the German consulate in Mumbai," he added.Ranjit Deshmukh, senior research associate of city-based energy group 'Prayas' said, "Use of solar lanterns is a step forward in replacing kerosene-based lighting. It is an intermediate step towards rural electrification. Kerosene usage results in pollution and carbon emissions. But most importantly, expense on kerosene forms a big portion of the income of poor households."Maharashtra has nearly 100 per cent electrification, with only about 257 unelectrified villages. However, the number of households without access to electricity is estimated at several lakhs, even after the implementation of the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, Deshmukh added.

a((VNAGPUR: It has been raining questions regarding forest, wildlife and environment issues in the ongoing monsoon session of the state legislature in Mumbai. Does it mean that our MLAs are becoming green? TOI spoke to a section of environmentalists, who don't feel that is the case.The session is in full swing now, and the number of questions on wildlife, forest and environment issues may go over the 100 mark by the time the session concludes on July 28. Till July 16, 62 such questions had come up for discussion in the House.Noted wildlife expert Kishor Rithe says the trend about asking questions on problems related to wildlife is good. "But looking at the questions, I don't think it will really change the ground situation," he felt.Several of the questions asked appeared to be superficial like â\u20ac\u201d number of tigers in the state; whether crop compensation would be given for loss due to wildlife; new method of tiger census; worshipping God in Tadoba; restrictions in Chandoli and Koyna sanctuaries etc. Most of the questions were such that information could have been acquired by any individual under RTI, and you don't need to be an MLA for that.Wildlife experts said, there are 41 protected areas (PAs) in Maharashtra. These PAs have been playing an important role by contributing several ecological services for the development of their 'command areas'. These areas act as healthy watersheds, which enrich underground watertable, provide pest controllers, regulate climate for agriculture, provide conservation-based employment to locals and also give minor forest produce to buffer villages."The present set of questions by MLAs do not highlight the importance of PAs and have failed to address the real issues," Rithe said. MLAs who have never seen or known the ground reality in a particular area appear to be raising questions about such areas, he said.For example, Achalpur MLA Bacchu Kadu raised a question on Koyana and Chandoli wildlife sanctuaries in Satara district. Similarly, the MLA from Satara district Vikramsingh Patankar asked questions related to Melghat. It would be very unlikely for any of these MLAs to have visited either of the PAs.Interestingly, several questions pertained to Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and the maximum were complaints about wildlife and damage from them. The newly formed Sahyadri Tiger Reserve has been in the media for illegal projects in the reserve under political patronage.However, none of the MLAs raised the burning issue of 'climate change'.Bittu Sahgal, environmentalist and editor of 'Sanctuary' magazine, said, "We should be more concerned about the present situation of environment. The casual questions and casual answers in the House won't help to overcome the crisis."Nishikant Kale, president of Nature Conservation Society, Amravati (NCSA), feels that MLAs should also be worried about the deteriorating situation of our wildlife reserves. "Sadly, the questions asked by the MLAs hardly made any difference. So many questions were raised but no one asked why things have been worsening. Our MLAs are beating about the bush," said Kale.Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust (CAT), Mumbai, also felt that core issues of threat to wildlife and forests from proposed mining activities in Vidarbha have been sidelined in the volley of questions raised by the MLAs.TOI spoke to a couple of MLAs who raised questions. Independent MLA from Achalpur Bachhu Kadu said, "The fact that MLAs asked so many questions indicates that they are very much concerned about environment."Kadu had raised a question on Chandoli and Koyana sanctuaries. However, he himself did not know which question he had asked. "I'll know about it when the issue comes before the House," he quipped. The MLA admitted he has never visited these two areas.MLC Jainuddin Javheri says as forest and wildlife is mostly centred in Vidarbha, questions pertaining to it are bound to increase. MLAs asking many questions on these issues don't necessarily mean they are turning green. "Many questions asked by the MLAs get twisted replies and hence the issues fail to get justice," Javheri said.

a((VCountries might wage wars over oil but the most valuable resource in the world is water. It\u2019s the new oil, the colourless gold that\u2019s at a premium because it is becoming scarce.Today\u2019s nightmare is that tomorrow the glass will be empty because water supplies are fast evaporating on account of population pressures, urbanization and now, climate change. No country is likely to be left untouched, but the great thirst will be felt the most in the region that has the world\u2019s two most populous countries \u2014 India and China.A new study says the situation will be the bleakest in the basins of major Himalayan rivers, ie our own backyards. The study by the Strategic Foresight Group (SFG), Mumbai is titled \u2018The Himalayan Challenge\u2019 and frighteningly predicts that \u201cin the next 20 years, the four countries in the Himalayan sub-region (India, Nepal, China, Bangladesh) will face the depletion of almost 275 billion cubic metres of annual renewable water. For comparison, this is more than the total amount of water available in...Nepal at present.\u201dBut why must this region run dry? It is fed by major rivers such as the Yangtze, Indus, Ganges and the Brahmaputra. But the problem is all of them originate in the Tibetan Plateau and will be badly affected by melting glaciers. The report says it may all end very badly because a water deficit will have a cumulative, destructive effect on agricultural production, power generation, food availability and livelihood, forcing all four countries in the sub-region to try and secure water resources. They may even look beyond their borders, leading to geo-political tension.The point here is interesting. There are global forums that deliberate on oil prices and availability, but disputes over water are generally handled regionally or bilaterally. Sundeep Waslekar , executive director of the SFG laments the basic truth that \u201cthere are no global treaties on water. Only 17 nations (which don\u2019t include the four aforementioned) have signed the UN convention on non-navigational uses of international water courses, 1997 (which provides a mechanism to deal with trans-border waters).\u201dIndia has bilateral agreements on water. Treaties with Nepal and Bangladesh cover development of the Mahakali river and sharing the waters of the Ganga. But New Delhi has nothing like that with Beijing. If today\u2019s legal and policy architecture were used to deal with any future water dispute, India and China would have nothing more to look to than a couple of MoUs on sharing flood-season hydrological data on the Yarlong Tsangpo/Brahmaputra and the Sutlej/Langquin Zangbu rivers. Former water secretary Ramaswamy Iyer agrees that there is a chasm where there should be formal agreement. Until some years ago, water did not even figure in talks between India and China, he points out.Retired Colonel P K Gautam, research fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, adds that \u201cif China builds a dam on the Brahmaputra now, and we complain about lesser water flows later, it could say that India doesn\u2019t have any projects in the northeast.\u201dAdd to this the current problem of massive water shortages in both countries. This could force both India and China to \u201csecuritize\u201d water sources and lead to tension. India is already worried about China\u2019s reported plans to construct a massive 40,000 MW dam at the point where the Brahmaputra takes a U-bend to enter India. Delhi is also concerned about Beijing planning to divert Brahmaputra waters towards China\u2019s arid north.But B G Verghese, visiting professor at the Centre for Policy Research , says fears about the diversion of water are \u201chighly exaggerated\u201d because the difficult terrain makes it all but impossible to do this.Waslekar agrees, but says that\u2019s a reprieve that will only last 15 years at the most. He says it could be a window of opportunity, especially as \u201cChina\u2019s attitude has changed a little bit, especially towards the Mekong river basin on which it had earlier refused to share data with other affected nations. ... it is showing some kind of openness.\u201d So should India try and make joint plans with China for hydropower development and setting up stations in glacial areas to monitor their melting?Yes, says Gautam. \u201cIndia should negotiate with China. We need data on the quantum of water flow in the Brahmaputra, on the melting of glaciers.\u201dThe SFG report suggests creating a new regional forum, say a Himalayan rivers commission, to better manage the looming water problem. But like much else, that\u2019s difficult in a region dominated by the trust deficit between countries. The key lies in doing something before the rivers run dry and the taps as well.

a((VJAIPUR: Heavy rain in the desert districts of Barmer and some parts of Jaisalmer in the last few days has raised flood scare.In August 2006, the usually drought prone Barmer district was hit by flash flood, causing death of 104 people, mainly in the villages of kawas and Malwa. Kharif crop worth Rs 1,300 crore was damaged and about 75,194 cattle perished in the flood.Similarly, the neighbouring district of Jaisalmer was also hit by flood in June this year. Rain, due to cyclone Phet, caused havoc in the district. In fact, two villages in Jaisalmer were completely cut off and the Army was called in to assist in rescue operation. About 15,000 livestock also perished in the rain. The rain also disrupted rail and road connectivity in the region.Pokhran in Jaisalmer reported one of the highest rainfall of this season in the last few days. Dhorimana in Barmer witnessed 98 mm of rain till Sunday morning taking the total rain to 339.5 mm. Baitu reported a cumulative rainfall of 240 mm till now.Barmer district collector Gaurav Goyal said though heavy rain has been reported in the district in the last few days, the situation is under control. "We are keeping a close watch on the situation," he said.Vivek Laul, department of earth sciences, Pondicherry University, who studied the Barmer flood in 2006, in his research report said, "Waterlogging is a major problem in western Rajasthan because of the presence of Bentonite and gypsite deposit in the area."The study also noted that in the absence of any effective drainage and negligible downward percolation of water, the conditions worsened and took the shape of a disaster. Keeping in view the frequency of the problem of waterlogging and floods in the above areas, proper water-management approach is required to reduce the loss of life, property, agricultural products and materials in future.Proper water management may include development of a network of canals/minor canals for draining out water for its utilisation in irrigation and storage purposes, construction of suitably spaced wells and bore wells for recharging well-identified aquifers, channelising water to already identified palaeochannels and unused barren depressions, construction of more water tanks and enlarging existing tanks and ponds to increase their waterstorage capacity.United Nation's World Meteorological Organization in July 2003, had warned of an increase in frequency of extreme weather events because of climate change. The deluge in Rajasthan was caused by a low pressure zone over the area, itself a result of extreme heat conditions, experts note.Low pressure in deserts that results from extreme heat is referred to as thermal low' in meteorological parlance. Such conditions could be caused by global warming, experts say.

a((VANGUL: Orissa is trying to make hay while the corporate sun is shining on it, but industrialization seems to have taken the toll on the state's Angul-Talcher belt , a highly polluted area, thanks to the large number of coal mines, and power and steel industries. It even figures in the list 10 critically polluted areas of the country.A report prepared by IIT-Delhi and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has placed the belt in the seventh position. So much so, the air, water and soil of the area, known for the state's hottest temperature as well, have been seriously affected."Coal dust, fly ash, flouride content and unplanned transportation activities are some of the main causes for pollution in the Angul-Talcher area. The dust afloat in the local air, generated due to mining activities in Talcher area, settles down on water bodies in its vicinity, polluting the water as well as the air. Fine particles dispersed over a larger area by the faxtories also make it difficult for people to breathe," it is alleged.Secretary of the Nature Environment and Wildlife Society (News), Angul, Prasana Kumar Behera alleged that the heavy deposition of dust particles on the surface of drinking water, vegetation and other materials have become a regular feature in the area. "Due to non-compliance to emission and discharge norms by the power plants and coal mines, fluoride contents, toxic wastes, heavy metal and other industrial pollutants have contaminated the water, air and soil. Fire from the coal mines have become a regular feature, resulting in the rising temperature in the region. These are the main causes for the climate change and have created several health hazards for both people and environment," he alleged.Prasanta Kumar Pradhan, a resident of Dera village, located close to the coal mines, alleged that more than 16 people have died and many more been affected by diseases like tuberculosis, asthma, skin cancer and other stomach and heart problems in this village in the past one year.Despite repeated reminders to the local administration and the state level departments, no one did much to check pollution levels here, he alleged. He demanded a special team should be formed to investigate into the matter and take appropriate steps to normalize the condition of the soil, water and air of the region.According to a study report, humans are not at risk as long as the dust particles are below 200 microns. But in Talcher, the air has been found to be laden with particles as big as 500 microns and sometimes even above that.Additional district medical officer (ADMO), Angul, Ajaya Kumar Das has confirmed that diseases like tuberchulosis, asthma, skin cancer, flurosis, bronchitis, thyroidism, stomach and other ailments are commonplace in this region.

Deputy chief minister M K Stalin will be the chief guest at the launch of the programme.Exnora has appealed to Chennaiites to switch off lights for 10 minutes at 10 pm on October 10. During last year lights-out programme, the city saw a reduction of 57% in electricity consumption in the nine minutes that the lights were switched off, according to Exnora founder M B Nirmal.The Tamil Nadu campaign is headed by Kiruthika Udaynidhi, a environmentalist , while the Chennai campaign will be led by mayor M Subramanian. The launch and induction of the campaign leaders will be held at 10.30 am on July 31 at Everwin Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Kolathur.Besides, thousands of school students have been asked to cut down their carbon footprint by 10%. To monitor and for measuring the quantum of carbon reduced in each home, the children will be given a log book.The children will be expected to ensure that their family reduces the consumption of gas, electricity, water and vehicle fuel. In the log book, they will note down the consumption in units.

a((VIt's a real pleasure to be back in India. This is my third trip here and with each visit, time seems to have leaped forward by decades in just a few years. It is exhilarating to see a country growing at super-speed before your eyes. But I'm not just here to enjoy the energy of this country. I'm here with a very clear purpose: to renew the relationship between India and Britain \u2014 to re-launch a relationship that is stronger, wider and deeper. Both our countries have talked about it long enough. Now it's time to turn those words into reality.\u000a\u000aTo show how serious I am, I have brought with me the biggest visiting delegation of any British Prime Minister in recent memory: members of my cabinet, industry leaders, top businessmen and women, figures from the arts, sports and local government. We're all here to make the case that this deeper relationship will be beneficial not just for our own countries, but for the world.\u000a\u000aFrom the British perspective, it's clear why India matters. Most obviously, there is the dynamism of your economy. In the U.S., they used to say: \u201cGo West, young man\u201d to find opportunity and fortune. For today's entrepreneurs, the real promise is in the East. But your economy isn't the only reason India matters to Britain. There's also your democracy with its three million elected representatives \u2014 a beacon to our world. There is your tradition of tolerance, with dozens of faiths and hundreds of languages living side by side \u2014 a lesson to our world. And there is this country's sense of responsibility. Whether it's donating reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, peacekeeping in Sierra Leone or providing intellectual leadership in the G20, India is a source of strength to our world.\u000a\u000aSo it's clear why India matters to Britain. But why should Britain matter to India? I believe our two countries are natural partners. We have deep and close connections among our people, with nearly two million people of Indian origin living in the U.K. We share so much culturally, whether it's watching Shah Rukh Khan, eating the same food or watching cricket. Beyond the cultural bonds, Britain has practical attractions for India. We speak the world's language. We are still the world's sixth largest manufacturer and the best base for companies wanting to do business in Europe. We have some of the best universities in the world and we are a great hub for science and innovation. Britain still has the strengths of its history, not least our democracy, rule of law and strong institutions, but there is also the modern dynamism of the nation that helped pioneer the internet, unravel the DNA code and whose music, films and television are admired the world over. All of these things can mean opportunity for Indian investors and entrepreneurs.\u000a\u000aSo if these are the foundations of a stronger relationship, how can that relationship benefit our countries and the wider world? I believe there are three global challenges we must take on together.\u000a\u000aThe first challenge is economic. In the past couple of years, we have seen global economic turmoil. Now both our nations must ask how we can emerge from the storm stronger and more prosperous. We come at this challenge from very different angles. On any measure, India's economy is on an upward trajectory. In Britain, we're waking up to a new reality. For centuries my country assumed we could set the global economic pace. But economic power is shifting \u2014 particularly to Asia \u2014 so Britain has to work harder than ever before to earn its living in the world. I'm not ashamed to say that's one of the reasons why I'm here in India. I believe that to spread opportunity for all our people, from Delhi to Dundee, Bangalore to Birmingham, we would benefit from a common strategy for economic growth.\u000a\u000aWe must start by making our own economies as open and dynamic as possible. That's why within fifty days of coming into power, our government introduced an emergency budget to cut red tape, reduce corporation tax rates, improve our infrastructure and show that Britain is open for business. Next, both India and Britain must encourage more investment from each others' countries. Companies like Vodafone, Wipro and Infosys are showing the way \u2014 now let's go further. Yes, that means bringing together the best and brightest from both our countries through scholarships and by twinning universities. But it also means doing the more difficult thing of opening up our own economies to foreign direct investment. We have welcomed your expertise in car manufacturing and steel production; and we need you to reduce the barriers to foreign investment in legal services, defence, banking and insurance.\u000a\u000aBut perhaps the biggest economic boost of all will come from more trade. EU-India trade is worth £50 billion a year already \u2014 and I'm determined we expand that by sorting out an EU and India Free Trade Agreement by the end of the year. We also need to hammer out a global deal. Agreement on Doha would add $170 billion to the world economy. Together we need to make the argument that we will only get things moving on Doha if we expand it \u2014 because when the pie gets bigger, we'll all get a greater share. So let's demonstrate our commitment by opening up our economies and showing we mean business.\u000a\u000aThe second challenge we must meet together is ensuring global security. Both India and Britain have suffered grievously at the hands of terrorists. We've worked together in the fight against terrorism before and I'm here in India to propose an even closer security relationship. This year and in 2012, Delhi and London are hosting the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. It makes sense that we co-operate closely to ensure both are as safe as possible. It also makes sense for us to share expertise on defence technology \u2014 as we've seen with the building of Jaguar and Hawk aircraft in India in recent decades. And when it comes to the security of our people, we cannot ignore what's happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Let me be clear: India's relations with those countries are a matter for you \u2014 and you alone. But because when we both want to see a Pakistan free from terror, when we both want to see an Afghanistan that is secure in its own right, again it makes sense that we work together to realise those interests.\u000a\u000aThe third challenge we must meet together is climate change. Decisive action is long overdue \u2014 and that must be global action, with all major economies playing their part. It's only fair that those with the longest history of carbon emissions make the biggest contribution to this. But it's also fair that the largest polluting countries contribute too. Indian action is of course different to U.K. action. We know that India's development needs mean that its energy needs and carbon emissions will have to grow. But by working together, we can help you avoid some of the high carbon mistakes we made.\u000a\u000aSo this is the case I'm making for a stronger, wider, deeper relationship between India and Britain. I have come to your country in a spirit of humility. I know that Britain cannot rely on sentiment and shared history for a place in India's future. Your country has the whole world beating a path to its door. But I believe Britain should be India's partner of choice in the years ahead. Starting this week, that is what we are determined to deliver.\u000a\u000a(David Cameron is British Prime Minister.)

But Shakthi-Surabhi, a kitchen waste based biogas plant developed by the Vivekananda Kendra, Natural Resources Development Project (Vknardep), Kanyakumari, after nearly quarter century of experiments promises to change all that,\u201d says Mr. V. Muneeswaran, Supervisor of the Kendra.\u000a\u000a\u201cTill date the Kendra is credited for installing nearly 2,500 biogas units across the country and orders for several hundreds more are still pending,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aBetter alternative\u000a\u000aIn what way does this unit promise to be a better alternative to the conventional biogas plants?\u000a\u000aCattle dung is a major input for the conventional plants. And everyday the dung should be mixed as slurry and poured into the gas tank.\u000a\u000aBut for Shakthi-surabhi, cattle dung is required for initial charging and later on kitchen and other waste alone are sufficient for producing the required gas.\u000a\u000aTwo colours\u000a\u000aThe unit comes in two attractive colours. Made to order from 500 to 1,500 litres capacity, is easy to fix or relocate and can be installed either at the backyard (if it is an independent house) or in the terrace or sunshade in flat structures. According to Mr. G. Vasudeo, secretary, Shakthi surabhi works on similar principles of a traditional biogas plant, but modified it to suit urban requirements also.\u000a\u000aRequired feed materials\u000a\u000aLeftover cooked food (veg and non-veg), vegetable wastes, waste material from flour mills, non edible oil seed cakes (neem, jatropha etc) are some of the required feed materials.\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout 5 kg of waste is required for a 1 cubic metre plant which is equal to 0.43 kg of LPG. The unit consists of an inlet waste feed pipe, a digester, gas holder, water jacket, a gas delivery system and an outlet pipe,\u201d explains Mr. Muneeswaran.\u000a\u000aThe advantage of Shakthi surabhi is not just because it economizes and provides alternative fuel for cooking gas. It is also an excellent mechanism for biodegradable waste disposal.\u000a\u000aThe process is hygienic and is devoid of odour and flies. The unit also helps in controlling climate change effects and arrests green house gases, and the digested outlet slurry of the unit acts as good organic manure.\u000a\u000a"It is estimated that 100 cubic metres of biogas could produce 5 KW of energy to meet a 20-hour power requirement of a house," explains Mr. Vasudeo.\u000a\u000aNo bank loans\u000a\u000aRegarding availability of bank loans for setting up this unit Mr. Muni says, at present banks do not offer loan facilities for installing this plant. But the Government is offering subsidies for those interested.\u000a\u000a"Disposal of kitchen wastes over time is a major problem, even in cities.

a((VIn an important side event organised during the visit of UK Prime Minister David Cameron, the UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group met on Thursday to discuss laying down of a charter of principles, actions and mechanisms to cut carbon emissions and identify business opportunities to fight climate change in both the countries.\u000a\u000aCameron, who launched the group in February before becoming the UK Prime Minister, had said, This group has a clear mandate to help tackle climate change in a pro-business, pro-green growth, pro-innovation way.\u000a\u000aThe mandate is sought to be achieved through creation of opportunities for low-carbon business solutions in both the countries. These are sought to be identified by deliberations between group members as well as interviews conducted with them and others by ICF Consulting.\u000a\u000aGiving an example, John Banham, chairman, Johnson Matthey, who is also co-chair of the the UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group, told FE, We would come up with proposals on how to provide electricity in a sustainable way to 450 million people in India, who lack access to it.\u000a\u000aElaborating further, Genevieve Anderson, executive director, UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group, added, The charter would broadly focus on the role of the private sector in driving the shift to a low-carbon economy, conducting joint R&D, laying down a framework for setting up demonstration projects, and improving the flow of capital. The group is functioning out of the climate group office in London, which is an NGO working globally with governments and businesses to usher in a low-carbon economy.\u000a\u000aMark Kenber, deputy CEO, the climate group, said, The ultimate aim is to focus on win-win solutions for both the countries. It can be achieved by leveraging the strengths of each country for the benefit of the other. For example, while India can lead in deploying IT solutions to develop smart grids, UK can share its expertise in carbon financing. The final report would be presented to the Prime Ministers of both the countries before being released in the third week of September at the Climate Week in New York City.\u000a\u000aThe 16-member group comprises eight members from each country. While the British members include John Banham, chairman, Johnson Matthey; Stuart Rose, chairman, Marks and Spencer; Stephen Green, chairman, HSBC; Keith ONions, rector, Imperial College London; Steve Holliday, CEO, National Grid; Keith Parker, CEO, Nuclear Industry Association;James Murdoch, chairman & CEO, News Corporation, and John Rose, CEO, Rolls Royce, the Indian members include Amit Mitra, secretary general, Ficci; Mukesh Aghi, chairman & CEO, Steria; YK Modi, chairman, Great Eastern Energy Corp; Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman & MD, Bharti Enterprises; KK Modi, chairman, Modi Enterprises; Shiv Nadar, CEO, HCL; Hari Sankaram, MD, IL&FS, and Tulsi R Tanti, chairman & MD, Suzlon.

a((VUS environmental regulators on Thursday rejected a series of challenges to the science behind climate change, reaffirming that global warming is real and the result of man-made pollution.\u000a\u000aThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruling was welcomed by US climate groups and comes after a number of recent controversies over the workings of climate scientists provided fodder for sceptics around the world.\u000a\u000aThe EPA reaffirmed its 2009 "endangerment finding", which for the first time declared climate change a threat to public health and could serve as a basis for the US government taking action to reduce pollution.\u000a\u000aOpponents had argued that the "Climategate" scandal, involving errors discovered in a 2007 international climate report and emails leaked last year from a British university, had placed in doubt the science behind climate change.\u000a\u000aThe EPA rejected 10 separate challenges to its endangerment finding. EPA chief Lisa Jackson said that the ruling was "based on years of science from the US and around the world".\u000a\u000aThe finding allows the agency to move ahead with specific actions to reduce US emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, including new limits on pollution from vehicles. Critics argue the EPA is acting without the approval of lawmakers, who are locked in a fierce debate over the direction of US climate policy.\u000a\u000a"It is time to move beyond this year's contrived controversies over climate science," said Eileen Claussen, head of the US-based Pew Centre on Global Climate Change.\u000a\u000a

a((VSixty-five days before the Commonwealth Games begin in October, right to information (RTI) applications filed by HT questioning the benefit of replacing streetlights, revealed Delhi spent Rs 378 crore on new streetlights that consume more energy than their predecessors.\u000a\u000aBoth the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) have admitted their electricity bill will increase because the new bulbs are more powerful and offer higher illumination.\u000a\u000aThe RTI findings are in contrast to the climate change action plan \u2014 that entails energy efficiency \u2014 adopted by the Capital ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit in December 2009.\u000a\u000aThe PWD, whose share of the project amounts to Rs 198 crore, stopped short of revealing the change in its average electricity bill, saying it would depend on the number of fittings and hours of operation.\u000a\u000aThe MCD, that accounts for Rs 180 crore of the project, was more candid: The average annual electricity bill for each streetlight would be around Rs 9,600. There is no comparison with earlier streetlights as records are not available. Officials secretly admitted the increase could be 10-15 per cent.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to get worldclass streetlights at minimal cost, a Delhi government official told HT. Each streetlight costs around Rs 1.20 lakh.\u000a\u000aKolkata and Guwahati that opted for a similar project, under the guidance of Bureau of Energy Efficiency unlike Delhi, will pay less. Kolkata opted for LED lamps at double the cost of a normal streetlight that save 50 per cent more energy.

a((VNEW DELHI: From green concerts to kiosks to calculating the carbon footprints that you leave behind in your everyday life - the organising committee is going all out to ensure that common citizens become a part of its Green Games campaign.On Thursday, the OC flagged off the Low Carbon Campaign for the Commonwealth Games 2010 in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Helping the OC put together the initiative was Global Environment Facility, an international organisation.The project aims to develop and promote Low Carbon Campaign for the Commonwealth Games 2010, as a way of inducing behavioural change amongst the citizens, athletes and visitors during the Games. The adoption of these green practices would go a long way towards reducing not only the CWG 2010 carbon footprint but also the city's.As part of the initiative, a host of programmes have been scheduled. Like green music concerts, low-carbon fairs, plantation drive along the Queen's Baton drive, as well as developing public service messages, Shera pop-ups, radio messages on environmental and energy issues linking low-carbon practices with sports and sportsmen spirit.A series of activities in Delhi and NCR has also been planned, which include campaigns on waste and transport, setting up 20 carbon kiosks and carbon footprint calculators, etc. In addition, Global Environment Fund through its small grants programme for NGOs and CBOs is encouraging citizens to enjoy and adopt the spirit of green sports through plantation activities and trainings in schools.The other project partners include the Union ministry of environment and forests, Union ministry of new and renewable energy sources, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, department of environment, government of NCT Delhi, Centre for Media Studies and Centre for Environment Education.

a((VPUNE: Air pollution in Pune, one of the three problems which the city has to deal with urgently, is rising due to an increase in vehicles on the road.The Environment Status Report (ESR), a report card on the health of the city, which was tabled by The Energy and Research Institute (TERI) on Wednesday said immediate steps to improve the air quality are a must.Air pollution in Pune has become a serious' problem. The respiratory suspended particulate matter (PM 10) in the air is more than the standard national level. This has resulted in respiratory ailments. The ESR also said that dust rising from the roads was pushing up the PM10 level .The survey done by the air quality monitoring cell of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has said that roads contribute hugely to the air pollution."Vehicles plying on pucca roads blow 6,456 tonne dust every year while the dust raised by vehicles plying on kuccha road is 1,229 tonne every year. Though India has norms to control vehicular pollution, there is no norm related to road dust management," the ESR said.The rise in industrial activities around Pune has also contributed in the air pollution. "Small and medium industries are responsible for 303 tonne PM10 emission every year. Fossil fuels used in slums contribute to the air pollution. About 93,000 commercial properties which include hotels, malls and hospitals emit 204 tonne PM10 every year," the ESR said.Several measures were suggested by the report. One was an increase in the frequency of the public transport buses and a strengthening of the system to ensure that personal vehicles are not on the roads.The report also suggested the use of green fuel to bring down pollution. Public transport must be the mode of transport and projects like monorail and metro should be executed, the ESR said.A curb on adulteration of fuel, strict checking of vehicular pollution, and a control over use of generators was mooted.Pune's population has grown from 17 lakh in 1991 to an estimated 35 lakh in 2010. However, roads have not been developed in proportion to population growth even though vehicles have multiplied alarmingly.Moreover, the use of diesel generators in housing societies, malls and industrial units has gone up. Collectively, they emit 379.61 tonne PM10 every year.Crackers during Diwali add to the pollutants. The Chest Research Foundation 's study during Diwali celebrations has concluded that 25 per cent people in the city suffer because of air pollution due to crackers."The PMC will plan its strategy to curb air pollution with experts's help. We will also execute Teri's recommendations on reducing air pollution. Preparing the city's a carbon footprint is a step towards reduction of pollution in the city," additional municipal commissioner Umakant Dangat said.

On the same lines,a policy for promoting use of solar energy will be declared that would help in generating power,” Pawar said at a function in the city.\u000a\u000aThe state government has recently floated tenders for setting up solar energy projects to generate 125 MW power,he said,adding,“The idea is to promote use of solar energy in parts of the state where there is barren land. We expect it to be more beneficial in Marathwada area.”\u000a\u000aAn area of five acre land is required to generate one MW power and installing solar panels in the area with less green cover,said Pawar.\u000a\u000a“The government has decided to make the entire state free of load shedding by 2012. Thus,efforts are being taken to promote all source of energy for power generation,” he added.\u000a\u000aPawar said the small biogas plants being set up across the city by the civic body has proved that power generated is usable in the respective areas.\u000a\u000a“The disposal of solid waste within the respective electoral ward through biogas plants is a good initiative with dual target of waste disposal and power generation being achieved through it,” he said.\u000a\u000aPawar,who also holds the water resource ministry,said the dams in the state get filled by July end,but this is not the case this year.\u000a\u000a“The demand of water is increasing in the cities and the government has been reducing the supply for agriculture so that it meets the needs of urban population,” he said.\u000a\u000aIn Pune,the state was supplying 5 TMC water and using rest for irrigation purpose,but now 14 TMC water is being supplied to meet the city demand by cutting the water supplied for agriculture purpose,Pawar said,urging the citizens to use water carefully.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App

A draft report was discussed for launching a charter of principles and actions for strengthening collaboration recommended. The paper would be presented to the UK and Indian Governments in September.\u201cBy focusing on real actions, the UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group can demonstrate that there are real opportunities in shifting to cleaner forms of production and show the Governments a way forward in designing supportive policies, \u201d Mark Kenber, Deputy CEO, the Climate Group, said. The Climate Group is excited to be acting as secretariat to such a prestigious group of business leaders and looks forward to working with them to deliver their vision of low carbon growth and development, Kenber added.The leaders discussed the issues key to unlocking bilateral low carbon growth, including collaboration in areas such as R&D, investment, financing tools, trade, technology transfer and policy design.Sir Stuart Rose, UK chair of the new group and chairman of Marks & Spencer said: \u201cWe've worked very hard over the last few months to put together a draft report. I hope we'll have robust discussions to make sure that we end up with the right final report because, it's absolutely vital that India and the UK work together to create a sustainable low carbon economy."The Climate Group has commissioned ICF International to carry out a consultation with the business leaders and their companies to stitch up the draft report and charter. The leaders will present the final charter to UK and Indian Governments when they meet during the climate week in New York in September.Dr Amit Mitra, India Chair of the Group and Secretary-General, FICCI, said: \u201cThis initiative will catalyse on the market experiences of both countries and develop new models and mechanisms for climate mitigation through a market driven process and will bring technology and finance as central drivers in this initiative.\u201dThe new acting India Chair of the Business Leaders Group, Rajan Bharti Mittal, President of FICCI said: \u201cThis initiative between India and UK will become an important template for other countries to emulate\u201d.Genevieve Anderson ED of the UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group said: \u201cThis influential group of business leaders have put significant time and thought to the challenge of producing actionable recommendations and promoting a drive toward low carbon growth in both countries."

a((VIn a setback to the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh,legal experts have shot down its proposal to apply for certified emission reduction credits (CER). The civic body was contemplating applying to the United Nations Frame Work Convention on Climate Change for CERs and had sought legal opinion on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe municipal body,though,has signed an agreement with JP Associates,which is managing a garbage processing plant,under which the right to apply for CERs lies with JP Associates. The agreement states: “The proposed municipal solid waste processing plant will mitigate the emission of green house gases by avoiding the generation of methane from processed MSW in the dumpyard and reduce carbon emissions through substitution of RDF fuel in the boiler in place of coal. Both these activities may be eligible for benefit of CERs under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The company will be the sole beneficiary of such carbon credits.”\u000a\u000aThe legal opinion stated that as the MC had already signed the agreement with the company,it was not eligible to claim CERs. It further said since the plant would mitigate the emission of GHGs,it was eligible to apply for CERs.\u000a\u000aAs per the Kyoto Protocol,member countries have committed to reduction in their emissions by an average of five per cent by 2012 against the 1990 level. The protocol also allows industrialised countries to meet emission-reduction commitments through market-based mechanisms.\u000a\u000aThe civic body is spending lakhs on maintenance of the dumping ground. In the budget for this year,Rs 55 lakh has been earmarked for maintenance of the dumping ground. The councillors had raised questions during the House Meet held recently about why such a huge expenditure was needed when the garbage plant was functioning.\u000a\u000aAs part of a Central Pollution Control Board project,Rs 10 lakh has been earmarked for capping and closing of the dumping ground.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App

a((VIndia has witnessed the maximum dip in agriculture growth among 41 tropical countries in the last decade, courtesy climate change, says a joint study of NASA and Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).\u000a\u000aThe cause for the dramatic dip has been the phenomenal increase in night temperatures since the mid-1990s. \u201cUp to the 1990s, we did not have night temperature problems. Since then, there has been four to five times shift in the night time temperatures,\u201d said Krishna Kumar of IITM, the author of the joint study based on weather data generated by NASA satellites.\u000a\u000aThe study, to be published in journal Remote Sensing this month, says the impact of temperature rise has been seen more in case of rice than in wheat. \u201cIncrease in night temperatures during October is one of the causes for the fall in rice production,\u201d Kumar said, adding that depletion of underground water resources was also a major reason for the fall in production.\u000a\u000aAnalysis of weather data can provide some hope to India, which is reeling under rising food prices due to poor agriculture growth. The country had been able to sustain good agriculture growth since the 1960s with the Green Revolution even though the monsoon --- the main source of water for non-irrigated farmland --- has been below normal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe trend (in agriculture production) may reverse if good monsoon returns," Kumar said at a workshop organized by the Centre for Science and Environment and IIT Delhi on Friday.\u000a\u000aBut no scientist can predict when the good monsoon will return, admitted climate scientist J. Srinivasan, who contended that it was extremely difficult because of the flaws in the modelling systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is time for the country to make policy changes to fight climate change even though our predictions for future may not be 100 per cent correct,\u201d said B N Goswami, IITM director.

The US and Britain are trying to bully the World Bank in not going ahead with a $3.75 billion loan for a coal-fired power plant in South Africa.\u000a\u000aThis is their way of imposing a climate change agenda on the developing world. A Reuters report on Sunday said that board members from Africa, China and India have shot off a protest letter to World Bank president Robert Zoellick.\u000a\u000aThe loan may still get through when the World Bank board takes a decision on 6 April. But the US and Britain have threatened to withhold support for the loan.\u000a\u000aThere is nothing but hypocrisy here. Unlike the US, which does not even have a nationally approved target to cut carbon emissions, South Africa foresees a peak in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 2020 and 2025. The Obama administration\u2019s proposal to cut GHGs is stuck in the Senate. A country that cannot order its own politics on the subject has no business arm-twisting others into submission.

a((VALLAHABAD: A host of legal luminaries shared their views on the issue of sustainable development and global warming at a seminar held in the city on Sunday.Former Chief Justice of India JS Verma asked the members of legal fraternity to come together to face the challenge of global warming. A healthy environment is conducive to health, he said, adding that the environmental problems are broadly of two kinds: negative impact of the development process and impact of poverty and under development. Improper planned development causes greater deprivation to those directly affected by the project and the need is to assess the social realities and take care of their interests, Justice Verma said.Verma said though India has a legislation to check environmental degradation, the need is for its effective implementation. In recent years, the Supreme Court and the High Courts have used various laws to protect and improve the environment by enforcing the people's right to life under Article 21, Articles 48-A and 51A (g). The Supreme Court has applied the `doctrine of public trust' and the `principle of intergenerational equity' to develop the `precautionary principle' to 'anticipate, prevent and attack' the causes of environmental degradation, former CJI pointed out.He observed: "We have to realise that our lifestyle is contributing largely to global warming and climate change. The change of land use, deforestation, illicit mining in forests, and indiscriminate building activity even by conversion of green belts, water bodies and river beds is reducing water availability and increasing the emission of greenhouse gases.''Climate change is also affecting agriculture and the crops, he added.The seminar was organised by the Allahabad chapter of International Law Association (regional branch). Justice Ashok Bhushan; Prof Alok Gupta; former advocate general of UP, VB Upadhyay and chairman of State Minorities Commission SMA Kazmi also spoke on the issue. Justice Dilip Gupta welcomed the guests and speakers.

a((VIndia and the 27-nation European Union resolved last week to speed up talks so as to ink a free trade agreement by end-2010. The October date needs keeping, since a trade pact has been hanging fire since 2007. If the FTA means $9 billion worth of immediate business for India, the gains aren't just on one side. The world's second fastest growing major economy, India has a huge consumer market that'll attract anyone scouting for trade allies. Besides, India and EU are strategic partners owing in large measure to their shared belief in democracy and respect for human rights. Even if India-EU trade is below one-fifth of EU-China trade , the FTA will be based on political convergences that are always value add-ons to economic ties and enhance their potential.True, there are differences to be sorted out. One major sticking point is the EU's insistence that social issues child labour, human rights, climate change be discussed. India rightly opposes this. For one thing, it meets the economic criteria listed in EU's Global Europe strategy on FTAs, including market potential. For another, there are appropriate forums for diplomatic wrangling on social issues. For the EU to link, say, climate with trade is a too-clever-by-half way of raising non-tariff barriers (NTBs). The EU's focus on issues extraneous to trade protectionism by another name could be a deal-breaker.India demands that EU cut farm subsidies. Studies show Europe's common agricultural policy mainly benefits big agro-industrial conglomerates, which resort to dumping in developing countries. But single-point issues mustn't derail the pact. If, for instance, the EU insists on food safety standards or India guards its government procurement market, these issues can be shelved for another day. The focus must be on identifying areas of agreement. For instance, services, India's fastest growing sector, will bring huge gains on both sides.The EU has some legitimate grievances. In India, insurance FDI is restricted and multibrand retail out of bounds. Greater liberalisation here is desirable even without external prompting. The same goes for labour reform, building a common market or easing FDI inflows. With a relatively sorry rank on the ''ease of doing business'' index, India should reduce its own versions of NTBs like convoluted customs formalities and import licensing. Finally, it helps when FTA negotiators focus on the big picture. India-EU trade, at $107 billion today, has increased by an annual 16 per cent, signalling the potential benefits of opening up. Petty bickering mustn't mar a win-win situation for both sides.

It was born at the end of a two-day National Research Conference on Climate Change hosted by the IIT-Delhi this week.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a whole lot of work going on in India on various aspects of climate change,\u201d said Krishna Achutarao of the Centre of Atmospheric Sciences at the IIT-Delhi. \u201cBut it lacks a sense of integration.

a((VChina\u2019s planned domestic action of 20% reduction in energy intensity of GDP by end-2010 over 1990 levels as a part of its current national plan will reduce 1.5 billion tonnes per year, which is more than the 1 Gt reduction planned in the US till 2020, and China is on course to meet this target. China will account for slightly less than half of global reduction in emissions pledged subsequent to the Copenhagen Accord.THE low level of pledges of developed countries will leave poor countries, including India, with no carbon space for economic growth, as collectively they would need as much carbon budget as the developed countries are about to take up from now till 2050, that is about 4.5Gt, or a third of the remaining carbon budget, if they were to just reach patterns of resource use that are common for all countries.Existing and affordable technologies will not enable this kind of economic growth without a significant per-capita carbon emissions increase, whereas carbon space is not even assured for countries with energy services below the global average.At Copenhagen, the 80% cut in emissions by 2050 proposed by developed countries would have fixed their share of the atmospheric space at two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per-capita per year, leaving developing ones to fight among themselves for less than half that amount over the coming decades. Clearly , how the issue is framed is important.There are also problems with the way emission reduction is accounted under the current framework. The total amount of surplus emission credits is large enough to allow developed countries to follow a business-as-usual path till after 2020, while still complying with the currently-announced emissions targets.The accounting rules have loopholes. Generous emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol have added as much as 1.4 Gt of \u2018hot air\u2019 per year that can be sold even though they do not represent a real reductions in emissions.Including emissions from land use and the choice of a base year can amount to a reduction of as much as 1Gt for developed countries. For instance, Canada\u2019s recent pledge of a target of 17% reduction from the 2005 level will amount to 3% increase above the 1990 level, excluding emissions form the land use and forest sector.Recent estimates show that these loopholes would allow industrialised countries to increase actual domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2-3 Gt, and overall reductions in emissions of developed countries would be only 3% below 1990 levels in 2020. Absolute emission reduction is the only measurement relevant to the goal of stabilising the global climate, as well as for comparability.The time has come for a new paradigm that will develop burden-sharing criteria to close the gigatonne gap, modify consumption patterns and match joint research and transfer of technology in the industry, electricity generation and agriculture sectors with mitigation/adaptation results so that patterns of resource use are common for all countries.

a((VPaul Rose goes ice diving in Antarctica Following reports that the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) might not have been accurate in its prediction about glaciers melting in the Himalayas, the basic assumptions of climate change theory have been seriously questioned. But Paul Rose, internationally renowned adventurer and polar explorer, will have none of it. He has seen it happening at the south and north poles, the areas where the climate change is at its most noticeable. Rose has visited the poles 21 times in the last two decades and has been involved in scientific studies of the poles. “I first went to the Antarctic in 1992. Since then I have visited the North Pole nine times and the South Pole 12 times, and I have no doubt that the world is warming up and nowhere is it more apparent than the poles,” said Rose, recently in the city as part of British Council’s Low Carbon Futures programme on climate change. “While in the Arctic the impact is more noticeable with almost a navigational channel having opened up for trans-Arctic shipping, even in the Antarctic the ice shelves are breaking up more frequently than before. One can feel it while diving under the ice,” said Rose. The most recent visit to the Antarctic two months ago is linked to a study to trace trapped methane in the area and its relation to climate change over the period, especially during the glacial age 11,000 years ago. Rose feels that the IPCC scientists have mishandled the data on the Himalayan blunder. He called it “inexcusable” and said that the fault has “opened up the door for climate sceptics”. “But one should not decide on the basis of such solitary information; rather one should consider the entire gamut of information on climate change before forming any opinion and it is overwhelmingly in favour of climate change happening in the planet,” said Rose. The controversy erupted when it was found out that the contention of the IPCC’s fourth assessment report, that the Himalayan glaciers are receding faster than in any other part of the world and are likely to disappear by 2035, wasn’t taken from a scientific journal, but from WWF, which was in turn based on a story by the British popular science magazine, New Scientist. The “air” has become murkier with recent reports of manipulation of scientific data by the Global Climate Project, whose researchers concluded that climate change is happening faster than thought earlier. But the “no climate change” theory has few takers, for so overwhelming is the evidence to the contrary, Rose said. “With education, people will be more aware of the damage to the climate that they are causing. I’m optimistic about the future and feel that the next global leadership will come from countries like India,” said Rose.

The minister, however, added there were continuing concerns about the glaciers since most of them were retreating.Apart from establishing the National Institute of Himalayan Glaciology at Dehradun and asking the states concerned to adopt `best practices', the government is also trying to talk with countries like China, Nepal and Bhutan to work out a regional approach to the problem.

a((VNEW DELHI: Reiterating New Delhi\u2019s unequivocal support for IPCC chairman R K Pachauri, the Centre on Monday made it clear that it would fight any attempt to unseat him. In the meantime, Mr Pachauri has ruled out any possibility of resigning as the boss of the Nobel Prize winning climate change panel.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aResponding to questions on the Himalayan glaciers in the Rajya Sabha, environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who had been accused by the IPCC boss of indulging in \u2018voodoo science\u2019, came to Mr Pachauri\u2019s defence. \u201cWe have full confidence in the chairman of IPCC. The prime minister and I have, time and again, publicly and categorically backed the IPCC chairman. We will fight any attempt to unseat him,\u201d Mr Ramesh said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe minister said that what the government had objected to was the \u2018panic and alarm\u2019 created by IPCC\u2019s fourth assessment report which said that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The report was based on poorly substantiated estimates of recession. \u201cIn drafting the paragraph on the subject in question, the clear and well established standards of evidence, required by IPCC procedures, were not applied properly,\u201d Mr Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aMaking it clear, that the objections raised were not about the IPCC chair, Mr Ramesh said that India\u2019s objection was to the language and the \u201cpolitical use of the IPCC report\u201d to pressure India to make concessions in negotiations and take on emission commitments. \u201cIndia\u2019s objections to the report were upheld and we were vindicated,\u201d the minister said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere has been intense pressure on Mr Pachauri to resign. Sources said that there is no provision for the removal of the IPCC chair, which is why there has been pressure on Mr Pachauri to resign.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHowever, there has been some relief for the embattled climate change panel chief as heads of states and governments rallied around him and offered support. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who recently announced the Amsterdam-based Inter-Academy Council would review the working of the IPCC, too gave Mr Pachauri is full backing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aReiterating his faith in Mr Pachauri\u2019s stewardship of IPCC, Mr Ban Ki-moon stressed that despite \u201ca very small number of errors\u201d in the IPCC\u2019s fourth assessment report, he has \u201cseen no credible evidence that challenges the main conclusions of that report.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTaking comfort in the support he has got, Mr Pachauri said, \u201cthe IPCC has already instituted an inquiry.

Justice Keong, who inaugurated the conference on Sunday, explained the steps taken by the Singapore government for reducing carbon emissions. Gas-based power generation had reduced carbon emissions to a considerable level, and the government was trying other means to effect further reductions, he said.\u000a\u000aJustice P. Sathasivam of the Supreme Court of India said scientific experts had warned that \u201cif human activity continues at its present rate, the average global temperature on Earth could rise by up to 7 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era. The danger has been recognised but not overcome. It is no exaggeration to say that humanity is currently tottering on the brink of a climate catastrophe.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said the Copenhagen summit did not result in any legally binding corollary to the Kyoto Protocol, though there was massive expectation for that to happen. He said climate change posed an immediate and far-reaching threat to the people and communities around the world and had implications for the full enjoyment of human rights.\u000a\u000aHe was of the view that using energy more efficiently, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energies and changing our lifestyles were keys to solving the problem.\u000a\u000aHe explained the initiatives taken by the Supreme Court of India to preserve and protect the environment through its various orders as well as by its Forest Bench to preserve the forest wealth and the flora and fauna.

a((VGood news has come out of the United Nations Environment Programmes Bali session: an independent committee of distinguished experts will be set up to assess how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vets scientific data, synthesises conclusions and conveys these to concerned people. Given the recent storm generated by allegations of error and all the adverse publicity that they have attracted to both IPCC and its cause, this was actually a necessary move for IPCC to reestablish its credibility. This is a body mandated to go through literature published on climate science across the world, which is not only a mammoth and complex undertaking by any measure but also involves thousands of scientists from more than 100 countries. What has emerged out of Bali is not an apologia for the four assessment reports already on the table or the basic science underlying IPCCs broad position on global warming. Instead, it represents a commitment to make procedures more rigorous and identify existing loopholes in the enforcement of procedures that are already on the IPCC books. The review committee will be demonstrably independent of both IPCC and its chairman.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, whatever the Copenhagen disappointments and the like may have been and whatsoever may have been the ways in which IPCC could have better handled allegations of error, its clear that the UN body has played an important role in reshaping institutional thinking on climate change over the last few years. On both business and government fronts, it has impelled public opinion to move towards limiting emissions. Consider the Budget for this year. It conveys a strong intent to move the country towards a greener energy mix. First, there was the proposal to create a special fund to finance research and development in renewables and promote environment-friendly technologies. Second, as the cess announced on coal indicated, the government is not only incentivising cleaner sources of energy like natural gas but also moving towards a more efficient coal regime. The FMs commitment to secure legislative approval for auctioning captive coal blocks would gradually align domestic coal prices with international ones, as well as make cleaner energy sources more competitive. China has simultaneously announced that its working on a programme to ensure that 15% of its total consumption mix will come from clean energy by 2020. IPCC must be given some credit for why Chindia have become more proactive on climate change, turning around from their the developed countries must fix what they broke focus to become constructively occupied with breeding domestic low-carbon policies. In continuing to advance in this direction, they could do with a stronger, more rigorous and credible IPCC.

a((VNEW DELHI: Union environment and forest minister Jairam Ramesh has dropped Prodipto Ghosh and Chandrashekhar Dasgupta \u2014 his most vocal critics \u2014 from the suggestive list forwarded to the PM for reconstitution of the core negotiating group on climate change The core negotiating group (CNG) is the set of advisers \u2014 serving and retired government officials \u2014 who advise the government on the international climate change negotiations and the stance and strategies India should take to further its cause at the complex talks.The minister has forwarded a new suggestive list after dropping the names of the two veterans that he has often found himself at odds with. But the final say on the CNG lies with PM Manmohan Singh. The PMO is yet to take a view on the issue, sources told TOI.When contacted on the issue, Jairam Ramesh told TOI: "It is very premature to say who is in and who isn't. It is still under discussion."Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, India's most senior climate negotiator and a retired Indian Foreign Service officer, along with the ex-environment secretary Prodipto Ghosh, another old hand at climate talks, have on several occasions in the past openly criticized the environment minister for altering India's stance without gaining any advantage at the climate talks and for keeping the team of official negotiators in blind about his moves.The two, along with Shyam Saran \u2014 the PM's special envoy on climate change who recently resigned from the position \u2014 are known to have often held dramatically different views than the union minister on India's response to increasing pressure from developed countries to alter its long-standing stance.With most others on the climate negotiating team being serving government officials, the two retired bureaucrats \u2014Dasgupta and Ghosh \u2014 are seen as the only ones capable of joining issues with the minister publicly. They carry weight as individuals in the international diplomatic arena as on home ground with their criticism earlier having caused a political storm for Ramesh.On one occasion in 2009 they had refused to represent India at crucial UN climate talks until the minister personally clarified his position to them after some controversial remarks in the press.In the most recent episode Dasgupta had criticized the minister for questioning the most basic of principles of Indian climate diplomacy that even PM had repeatedly stated in his speeches.

It also says advanced Generation III and Generation IV nuclear reactors provide long-term technological solutions."However, closing the fuel cycle has to be emphasised for a sustainable mitigation of climate change threats and global warming," Chidambaram said.

a((VNEW DELHI: With BASIC countries \u2014 Brazil, South Africa, India and China \u2014 emerging as an influential grouping in climate change negotiations, Mexico, Argentina and Indonesia have expressed interest in associating themselves with the group. But the April meeting of BASIC, which to be held in Cape Town is unlikely to broaden the alliance.Sources said that Brazil and China have indicated that they are not keen on having either Mexico or Argentina participate in BASIC meetings. A senior Indian government functionary said that there has been no formal discussion among BASIC countries on this issue. However, the general sense is that they are not keen on the idea.The growing interest in BASIC comes on the back of the crucial role that the group of four played in climate negotiations in Copenhagen . A source close to the development said that China was not keen on Indonesia and Mexico\u2019s participation because of their proximity to the United States. India, too, is unlikely to be eager to include Mexico in the group as there were differences on key issues such as finance.Mexico had formally proposed that all countries contribute to a global fund while India is clear that finances have to be provided by industrialised countries.In the immediate aftermath of the December summit, apprehensions were expressed that the four \u201cadvanced developing countries\u201d had broken ranks with the G-77 and struck out on their own.At their post-Copenhagen meeting in January, BASIC countries stressed that they are part of the G-77 and that BASIC was merely a platform for strategising and not taking decisions. Making it clear that the four country group was part of the G-77, they stressed that the G-77 chair was always part of BASIC meetings.The need to ensure that right signals are sent out have become greater as the chairmanship of the G-77 is now with Yemen. A gravitation of countries to BASIC could undermine the G-77 chair, which is seen as weaker than its predecessor Sudan, and consequently weaken the 132 developing country grouping.If the BASIC becomes the grouping of the more advanced developing countries, it is likely to lead to greater rifts within the G-77.As in earlier climate summits, in Copenhagen there was a clear attempt to split the developing world by positing the small island states and the less developed countries against the other developing countries. BASIC needs to retain its key position within the G-77 if it has to successfully leverage its negotiating space.Senior negotiators suggest that including countries like Mexico, Argentina and Indonesia in the BASIC would only serve to weaken it. \u201cNone of these three countries have as geo-political clout as the four constituents of the BASIC. There appears to be no advantage in including these countries,\u201d a senior negotiator said.

This is no conspiracy to restrict the consumption of rajma and other legumes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat has really got the FAO\u2019s wind up is the fact that cattle expel more polluting gases that trigger climate change than carbon-dioxide-spewing cars, as methane traps heat 20 times more than CO2. It has been pointed out that a cow produces more noxious gases than an SUV, so the implications for India are, well, moo-t . We have only 75 million-odd motor vehicles but we have the world\u2019s largest population of livestock \u2014 around 485 million, including some 283 million cattle, and the rest, goats and sheep \u2014 which collectively emit 11.75 million tonnes of methane.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe FAO\u2019s suggestion therefore, that livestock farmers should \u201cinternalise the costs of environmental damages\u201d , has caused consternation, not the least because of the sheer impossibility of that task, however apposite. Even as the slimming industry has made a milch cow out of urban obesity, Indian scientists have been ruminating on better diets for bovines \u2014 that would lead to less odious emanations \u2014 rather than expect producers to absorb their ill-effects.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIs it a coincidence or plain cowbelch politics that the FAO\u2019s call for a flatulence tax also finds BRIC nations on the wrong side of the cattle battle, given their larger bovine populations? Since the FAO\u2019s observations have come at a time when meat consumption has surged worldwide, perhaps the implicit green solution is to do what the cows do \u2014 go vegetarian!\u000a\u000a

a((VA research team, led by Étienne Berthier of the Laboratory for Space Studies in Geophysics and Oceanography at the Université de Toulouse in France, says that glacier melt in Alaska between 1962 and 2006 contributed about one-third less to sea-level rise than previously estimated.\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have largely overestimated mass loss from Alaskan glaciers over the past 40-plus years, according to Erik Schiefer, a Northern Arizona University geographer who coauthored a paper in the February issue of Nature Geoscience that recalculates glacier melt in Alaska.\u000a\u000aThe melting of glaciers is well documented, but when looking at the rate at which they have been retreating, the team of international researchers steps back and says not so fast.\u000a\u000aSchiefer said melting glaciers in Alaska originally were thought to contribute about .0067 inches to sea-level rise per year. The team's new calculations put that number closer to .0047 inches per year. The numbers sound small, but as Schiefer said, \u201cIt adds up over the decades.\u201d\u000a\u000aPrevious methods estimated melt for a smaller subset of individual glaciers. The most comprehensive technique previously available used planes that flew along the centerlines of selected glaciers to measure ice surface elevations. These elevations were then compared to those mapped in the 1950s and 1960s. From this, researchers inferred elevation changes and then extrapolated this to other glaciers.\u000a\u000aTwo factors\u000a\u000aTwo factors led to the original overestimation of ice loss with this method, Schiefer said. One is the impact of thick deposits of rock debris that offer protection from solar radiation and, thus, melting. The other was not accounting for the thinner ice along the edges of glaciers that also resulted in less ice melt.\u000a\u000aWhile the team looked at three-fourths of all the ice in Alaska, Schiefer noted, \u201cWe're also talking about a small proportion of ice on the planet. When massive ice sheets (such as in the Antarctic and Greenland) are added in, you're looking at significantly greater rates of sea-level rise.\u201d\u000a\u000aSchiefer said the team plans to use the same methodologies from the Alaskan study in other glacial regions to determine if further recalibrations of ice melt are in order. These techniques use satellite imagery that spans vast areas of ice cover, according to a Northern Arizona University press release.\u000a\u000aSchiefer and his colleagues used data from the SPOT 5 French satellite and the NASA/Japanese ASTER satellite and converted the optical imagery to elevation information. They then compared this information to the topographical series maps of glacial elevations dating back to the 1950s.\u000a\u000aWhile the team determined a lower rate of glacial melt during a greater than 40-year span, Schiefer said other studies have demonstrated the rate of ice loss has more than doubled in just the last two decades.\u000a\u000aAcceleration continues\u000a\u000a\u201cWith current projections of climate change, we expect that acceleration to continue,\u201d Schiefer said. This substantial increase in ice loss since the 1990s is now pushing up the rise in sea level to between .0098 inches and .0118 inches per year\u2014more than double the average rate for the last 40 years. \u2014 Our Bureau

The proposed farm will come up over 300 acres of waste land.\u000a\u000aThe infrastructural facilities like road, water supply and power evacuation would be provided by the developer to the prospective willing to set up solar power plants in the complex.\u000a\u000aOREDA officials have held preliminary discussion with the state owned Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) and the latter has agreed to provide the required land for the purpose.\u000a\u000aAbout 300 acres of land has been identified in Bolangir district and each of the units would be provided 5 acres of developed land per megawatt of power proposed to be generated by them, sources said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, OREDA is in the process of seeking the host country approval (HCA) for the domestic bio-gas plants to be set up in the state. The programme, called \u2018Orissa Household Biogas Programme\u2019, aims to install around 7,000 biogas plants every year in the state.\u000a\u000aIt is expected to displace carbon intensive non renewable biomass (firewood) which is presently used as primary fuel for cooking purpose.\u000a\u000a(KfW) has partnered with OREDA to develop this program and engaged Climate Focus (Germany) and CTRAN Consulting, a leading carbon asset management company to help OREDA in this venture.\u000a\u000aAfter obtaining the approval from the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), the validation of the bio-gas plants project under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will be started.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIndia struck a different tone at the ongoing global meet on nuclear energy, drawing attention to the pitfalls of relying solely on uranium fuel for atomic reactors. It said the world must revive research in utilising thorium and join hands with India, only country engaged in this endeavour, to ensure that energy is sustainable for the next few centuries.\u000a\u000aWarning that the reliance on uranium will not be sustainable beyond this century, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Srikumar Banerjee said the \u201cworld must wake up\u201d and support India's three-stage nuclear programme. \u201cThe constraint in relying only on uranium was never addressed in this conference. The world has to pay attention to uranium 238 using plutonium in a closed fuel cycle \u2014 this transition is essential for the whole world. But this is not enough. Unless thorium is used, it will not be possible to have sustainable energy on this planet. Only with thorium will it be possible for the whole world to get enough energy for several centuries. This was discussed in the 1950s and 1960s but the world has since forgotten it,\u201d Dr. Banerjee pointed out, speaking at a roundtable session on \u201cNuclear power and the energy mix in a sustainable development perspective\u201d here on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe AEC chief said the entire nuclear energy projections were based on the Western Europe-U.S. type of one to two per cent growth in requirement. On the other hand, developing countries needed to step up their energy needs by 10 per cent which would not be met with the current emphasis on relying only on uranium 235.\u000a\u000aDr. Banerjee said the present available reserves of 5.469 million tonnes of uranium could support 570 gigawatts of electricity till 2025 and not beyond. Taking the total identified and undiscovered reserves of 16 million tonnes would extend availability till the end of the century. He also called for new reactor designs that were proliferation-proof, and asked developed countries to ease restrictions on enrichment and reprocessing as a medium-term measure.\u000a\u000aProviding India as a case study, he pointed out that the nine per cent growth pattern was based on a small section of 300 million people participating in the economy. Thus 10 per cent growth in energy requirement was possible to sustain on a per capita basis \u2014 per capita energy consumption was currently 700 kw/hour, whereas reasonable human development required at least seven times more.\u000a\u000aCan renewable energy tackle it? Dr. Banerjee felt, \u201cWe can try as much as possible,\u201d but suggested that it was impossible for this segment to fill the gap. If India resorted to coal to achieve this goal, it would need to burn 4.7 billion tonnes of coal per year or over four times the consumption in the U.S. This would load the environment with 7.7 billion giga tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions that \u201cwould be shared by all of you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe world always felt there would be a miracle. Unfortunately, we have not seen any miracle for the last 40 years. Unless we wake up, humans won't be able to exist beyond this century,\u201d he observed.

a((VNot only does the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) promise to be one of the biggest sporting extravaganzas in the country, it plans to keep the show small in its carbon footprint too.\u000a\u000aAnd doing its bit to help the organisers achieve their goal is the famed hosiery industry of Ludhiana \u2014 otherwise notorious for its pollution record \u2014 with \u2018green kits\u2019.\u000a\u000aContracts have been received to produce the eco-friendly sportswear to be worn by IPL team owners like Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, the Ambanis, their players and the lakhs of fans expected to buy them as souvenirs.\u000a\u000aWhat makes kits eco-friendly The polyester comes from recycled raw material, cutting energy consumption 25-30 per cent. Ludhiana units stitching the garments are using solar heaters for the water to wash, and thereafter minimising the use of dryers. Lowering the temperature saves about 40 per cent in ironing. Stitching machinery is certified for energy efficiency. Recyclable material being used for packaging, which is kept at bare essential. Total cut-down on CO2 emissions: From 6-8 kg per garment to 3.5 \u20134.5 kg.\u000a\u000aCarbon footprint is the measure of the \u2018environment-killer\u2019 carbon dioxide (CO2) released in any activity by way of energy consumed to produce goods or carry out any work.\u000a\u000aAnd the specially designed \u201ccarbon neutraliser\u201d clothing cuts down on the vital count at every stage of production \u2014 from raw materials to packaging. The result: from the average 6-8 kg CO2 released in the environment per garment, it will be as low as 3.5 \u20134.5 kg per \u2018dri-fit garment\u2019 being produced.\u000a\u000aDifferent units have contracts to produce 16 lakh such kits.\u000a\u000aArun Dhand, owner of Ankita Impex, producing for Reebok, says: \u201cWe imported special raw materials, including polyester, which is sourced from recycling. Its carbon credentials have been scientifically established.\u201d\u000a\u000aReebok is supplying to Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers, Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab. Another global brand, Adidas, has given the contract to two other city-based firms \u2014 Knitwell Apparels and Ankita Impex\u2019s sister concern run by Dhand\u2019s son Anuj \u2014 to provide the kits to Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils.\u000a\u000aBut a small carbon footprint is not the only quality of the green kits. These are also 16 per cent lighter than the previous year\u2019s kits, and designed to keep the wearer drier, cooler and, thus, more comfortable. The fabric carries the sweat to its outer surface much quicker, thus facilitating fast evaporation. Then there are \u2018ventilation zones\u2019 \u2014 essentially, laser-cut holes \u2014 that enhance \u2018breathability\u2019 of the garment.\u000a\u000aAs this is the second time the local units are fabricating sportswear for the IPL, workers at the factories have their loyalties too. For Jugraj, it is Royal Challengers. \u201cIt was a proud moment when I saw team owner Vijay Mallaya wearing the shirt tailored by me. This time, I\u2019ve asked to be again put on the unit stitching for Royal Challengers,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aSanjay has been inscribing \u2018best of luck\u2019 on every carton containing kits for Mahendra Singh Dhoni\u2019s daredevils.

He said India has also conveyed three conditions for listing of its name.\u000a\u000aIndia has made it clear the accord was a political document and not a legally binding one; the accord is not a separate track of negotiations outside the UN Framework Convention Climate Change and the purpose of it was to bring consensus in the existing and ongoing two-track process under the UNFCCC, he said.\u000a\u000a"The accord could have value if the areas of convergence reflected in it are used to help the parties reach agreed outcomes under the UN multilateral negotiations in the two tracks," he said.

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Tuesday, Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said that India placed three conditions on its decision.

a((VMUMBAI: 'Going green' is no more an option for telecom operators. It has become a necessity in a market where margins are nosediving due to tariff wars, denting the profitability of the mightiest. With energy expenses constituting nearly 25% of the total network operating costs, efficient power management holds the key to improving financials, as operators have already shaved other costs to the bone by outsourcing non-core functions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEquipment vendors like Ericsson, tower companies including Bharti Infratel and network services provider GTL are investing big bucks in bringing out green products and solutions to cut operators\u2019 opex. While a pan-India deployment looks some time away, up to 20% reduction in energy requirements is achieveable in the near future, said industry officials.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia currently has around 3 lakh towers, and the number is expected to increase to 450,000 towers with 900,000 tenants in the next three years. Given the frequent power cuts, each tenant consumes almost 3,000 litres of diesel every year on a shared tower, which increases operations costs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cApart from reduction in levies and duties, efficient-energy management has the potential to bring down costs for operators,\u201d said Idea Cellular chief corporate affairs officer Rajat Mukarji. Idea is using bio-diesel on some of its base stations on a pilot basis. \u201cThe savings are nominal, as of now, but if it can be replicated on 3-lakh towers across the country, the amount of money that can be saved will be huge,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGTL president & COO (strategy & new technologies) Sharat Chandra said the company is pumping in Rs 1,400 crore in the first phase for engineering and deploying solutions that reduce energy expenses. \u201cThese solutions are targeted to cut energy requirements by up to 20%,\u201d he said. Aircel Cellular is already using these solutions, which include solar systems, micro-wind turbines, adoption of free cooling methods, energy audit, besides others.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGTL has deployed these solutions at more than 5,000 sites, reducing energy consumption and carbon emission. \u2018We are planning to turn the entire portfolio of towers into green towers in the next three years,\u201d added Mr Chandra.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile Bharti Airtel\u2019s EBITDA margin declined 1.53% year-on-year to 39.3% in the December quarter, the figure for Idea eroded from 25.3% to 23.5% due to a fierce tariff war. Airtel\u2019s infrastructure arm Bharti Infratel is aiming to cut energy costs by 15% annually with plans to invest Rs 300 crore in seven pilot projects (P7) for reducing energy consumption. \u201cWe have undertaken trials for solar power, bio diesel and free cooling, among others. We are rolling out pilots in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where grid availability is poor and diesel costs are high,\u201d said a Bharti Infratel official.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEricsson V-P (marketing & strategy) P Balaji said: \u201cWe are helping operators improve the efficiency of their networks through delivering energy-efficient products, providing optimal network design and introducing the innovative use of alternative energy sources to run these networks, lowering the cost of operations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEricsson has launched its wind-powered radio base station (RBS) site solution in India, offering low-cost of construction and maintenance. The towers do not require feeders and cooling systems, resulting in up to 40% lower consumption of power. It has also undertaken pilots using bio-diesel to cut costs and reduce carbon emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAccording to Macquarie Equities Research analyst Shubham Majumder, Indian operators run fairly efficient operations with limited scope for improving margins by cutting costs. \u201cNetwork opex is the only cost lever that would cushion the fall in profitability. Although these green initiatives to cut down the network opex costs are underway, it will be quite some time before they can help telcos attain significant cost savings,\u201d he said.

It expects India to stick to its stand as well, a senior Chinese official said on Wednesday."In future negotiations and cooperation on climate change, we will continue to be good partners. The government of India and China have signed an MOU enhancing our climate partnership," Xie Zhenhua, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a news conference here.Both India and China has signaled their approval to the Climate Change Accord on Tuesday long after it was worked out at the Copenhagen summit last year. The delay in approval by the two giant nations had caused anxiety among climate negotiators across the world.Chinese officials indicated on Wednesday they are keen to continue working with developing countries to press home the theme of "equal but differentiated responsibilities" on the issue of environment at the forthcoming meeting in Mexico. Xie said India and China are engaged in policy dialogue and consultations on the subject and would work closely at the international level."We are willing to step up cooperation in the areas of forestry, energy efficiency and renewable energy (with India)," Xie said.He said China would not allow intrusive supervision of the work on environmental restoration done in this country but would be open to consultation on the subject with international bodies.Xie said China would like to see more active cooperation of the United States on the issue of climate change. He praised the Obama administration for being more active on this score as compared to the previous one, but said more needs to be done by way of technology transfer and generous allocation of funds to the developing world."We know that there are disputes and difficulties within the U.S. on legislation, but we hope these, along with the US unwillingness to take more responsibilities, should not be shifted to other countries," Xie said.

a((VNEW DELHI: The power ministry may be the government's main instrument for implementing measures to reduce carbon emissions and improve efficiency in the energy sector but a group of experts put together by the Planning Commission to prepare a roadmap to turn the country on a low carbon growth pathway has left out the ministry, much to the chagrin of power minister Sushilkumar Shinde In a letter to plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Shinde pointed out that the omission -- "perhaps inadvertently" -- may hamper the panel from doing justice to its objectives. The panel, under the chairmanship of Kirit Parikh, is to suggest suitable legislation, rules and policies for turning India into a low-carbon economy. It is to do so after reviewing existing studies and conduct fresh ones for reducing emissions.Shinde said the ministry's input was vital for formulating green legislation or policies. "The ministry, based on the knowledge and overview of the sector, would be able to highlight concerns relevant to the sector during formulation of the strategy for low-carbon economy," he said. The minister, however, acknowledged that the panel included two of his ministry's technical bodies -- Bureau of Energy Efficiency and the Central Electricity Authority.The power sector accounts for nearly 60% of carbon emissions as nearly two-thirds of electricity is generated by coal-burning plants in the country. The ministry is spearheading several initiatives such as preparing ground for trading in energy efficiency certificates and induction of clean-coal and `super-critical' power plant technologies.Shinde said his ministry believed that emissions in the energy sector could be reduced by 10-15% by 2021-22, provided the projections in capacity addition of hydro power, gas-fired plants, nuclear energy, solar and other renewable sources were met. This could happen only if pertinent or concerned ministries such as petroleum, environment and renewable resources played a proactive role in their respective spheres.

However, it said that the world might not be able to reach a global deal until 2011.\u000a\u000aThe communication comes at a time when countries are preparing for the big climate conference in Cancun, Mexico, at the end of this year.\u000a\u000aConnie Hedegaard, Commissioner for Climate Action, said, " can be controlled only if all major emitters take action. Obviously nobody would, stronger than myself, hope that we could get everything done in Mexico, but the signals coming out of various capitals of big emitters, unfortunately, do not make that likely.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe EU would be ready to reach a legally-binding global deal at Mexico, the Commission said. However, it added, differences between countries may delay an agreement until 2011. \u201cEU is ready but the world might not be, and therefore our approach has to be step-wise.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs part of this Accord, the European Union has committed to a 20 per cent emissions cut below 1990 levels by 2020, and to scaling up this reduction to 30 per cent if other major economies agree to do their fair share of the global effort.\u000a\u000aIn the talks, pressure is building on developing economies such as India and China to limit their emission levels. India, along with the other (Brazil, South Africa, China) countries recently agreed to be formally associated with it. countries have emphasized that the Accord is only a political statement and it has to be part of the United Nation\u2019s two-track negotiation process.\u000a\u000aThe Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had firmly opposed India\u2019s move to endorse the Accord. It had said that industrialised nations would get away with a pledge-and-review system as the Accord did not set a firm peaking year for Annex 1 countries. These countries had peaked their emissions in the year 2000, the had observed.\u000a\u000aThe Commission also said the Accord was a \u201cstep towards the EU's goal of a legally binding global climate agreement, which should take effect in 2013 at the end of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.\u201d The Accord endorses the EU's core objective of keeping global warming below 2ºC above the pre-industrial temperature in order to prevent the worst impacts of\u000a\u000aIt said the remained the central building block of the UN process. \u201cBut, the limited number of countries it covers, and its serious weaknesses, must be addressed.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf allowed to continue with these weaknesses, which concern accounting rules for forestry emissions and the handling of surplus national emission rights from the 2008-2012 period, it would risk reducing the industrialised countries' current emission reduction pledges to almost zero, it further stated.\u000a\u000a\u201cSwift implementation of the EU's commitment to provide ¤2.4 billion in 'fast start' financial assistance to developing countries annually in 2010-2012 is essential both to the EU's credibility and to enhancing recipient countries' capacities to address climate change. The Commission is ready to help ensure the EU's assistance is well coordinated.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe EU should continue to work to advance the development of the international carbon market, which is essential for driving low-carbon investments and reducing global emissions cost-effectively.

Pachauri, an adviser to the Prime Minister on climate change, and chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), publicly lock horns with environment minister Jairam Ramesh.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis body will see that whatever input we present internationally will be unanimous,\u201d the official added.\u000a\u000aLearning lessons:R.K. Pachauri, adviser to the Prime Minister. The inter-ministerial group will be coordinated by the climate change division at the department of science and technology. This division was the result of India\u2019s eight-point national action plan on climate change, directed by the Prime Minister, and is expected to fund and assess research that will constitute strategic knowledge on climate change.\u000a\u000aAmong the tasks of the group that is likely to come into being this May is the collation of scientific inputs for India\u2019s periodic greenhouse gas inventory report that is to be submitted to the United Nations.\u000a\u000aIndia has only made one such submission, in 1994, and several organizations are working on the second, which is due later this decade.\u000a\u000aA second official familiar with the creation of the group and who too declined to be identified agreed that it could \u201cavoid situations such as the IPCC controversy\u201d.\u000a\u000aA draft of IPCC\u2019s report, published in 2007 and circulated to governments across the world, said the total area of Himalayan glaciers would shrink from the present 500,000 sq. km to 100,000 sq. km by the 2035. IPCC retracted this statement subsequently. However, Pachauri was hard-pressed, at least for a while, to defend the very scientific basis of climate change.\u000a\u000aIt didn\u2019t help that Ramesh was critical of IPCC. \u201cMy problem was...with the alarmist position of the IPCC,\u201d Ramesh had said at the time of the glacier controversy. \u201cSecondly, the report made sweeping statements, which were not backed by scientific facts.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia shifted its stance on climate change policy\u2014from refusing to take on any emission reduction measures to accepting caps on the intensity of its emissions\u2014within a calendar year, dividing policymakers in government. Experts say deeper divisions were expected to emerge in the future, which in turn could affect policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe policy only comes in after scientific consensus. The big debates of the future will concentrate on the regional impact of climate change on different parts of the country and that would be even more fractious, simply because more people are going to be studying climate change impacts using all kinds of models,\u201d said K. Krishna Kumar of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and a contributor to IPCC reports.\u000a\u000aA government expert on the subject who is involved with climate change negotiations and who did not want to be identified said some of the differences could also arise from India\u2019s evolving position: \u201cFrom emissions intensity I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if India takes on emission cuts. Then different states would haggle over their responsibilities and all this could have a bearing at international tables.\u201d\u000a\u000ajacob.k@livemint.com

He said China and India would continue their cooperation at the negotiations being held by ad-hoc groups to reach a deal at the next climate conference to be held in Mexico. India, China, Brazil and South Africa brokered a deal at the Copenhagen Climate Summit that calls for limiting warming to two degree Celsius and commits rich countries to provide $100 billion to developing countries besides $30 billion to the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the next three years to fight climate change.

In November 2009, 41 per cent people in UK believed that climate change was man-made but by February the number fell to 26 per cent, a BBC survey said.\u000a\u000aDavid Atom, environment correspondent with The Guardian, admitted that climate scepticism has increased with \u201cpeople on streets\u201d now questioning validity of climate science.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC\u2019s problems stem from its mission to simplify scientific data to make it suitable for policy makers. \u201cIt is very much an advocacy group that\u2019s couched in a role of science,\u201d Roger Pielke, a political scientist with University of Colorado, told a news website.\u000a\u000aBut, in India, climate scientists such as G.N. Goswami, director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, are not disillusioned with the IPCC errors. \u201cWe have data to show that our weather is changing at a very fast pace and we need to act\u201d.\u000a\u000a

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe United Nations has initiated, in tandem with the Chair of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, \u201ca comprehensive, independent review of the IPCC's procedures and processes\u201d, including its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aWhile arguing he had seen no credible evidence challenging the main conclusions of the IPCC report and the consensus on climate change, he admitted, \u201cRegrettably, there were a very small number of errors in the Fourth Assessment Report.\u201d He added that it was important to remember that the report was a \u201c3,000 page synthesis of complex scientific data.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Report found that the warming of the climate is outpacing natural variability, driven largely by human activity. The U.N. however acknowledged that its credibility had come into question after revelations that the landmark publication contained some mistakes, including over the rate of Himalayan glacier melt.\u000a\u000aAccording to sources the Report\u2019s claim that most Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035, was based on information from the environmental group WWF. Similarly the claim was that global warming might destroy 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest was \u201cbased on an unsubstantiated claim by green campaigners who had no scientific expertise.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IPCC Chairman, Rajendra Pachauri has also recently come under fire for such lapses. Amid calls for his resignation on Wednesday he said, \u201cWe have received some criticism. We are receptive and sensitive to that and we are doing something about it."\u000a\u000aThe review would be conducted by the InterAcademy Council (IAC), an international scientific organisation, Mr. Ban clarified, saying \u201cIt will be conducted completely independently of the United Nations.\u201d It will be led by IAC co-chairs Robbert Dijkgraaf, who heads the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science, and Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the U.N.\u000a\u000aScientists will be selected to serve on a \u201cvoluntary and unpaid basis to prepare a draft report on their findings, which will then undergo an intensive peer review by other scientists\u201d. Characterising the task as \u201cforward-looking,\u201d Mr. Dijkgraaf said that there are \u201cno preconceived conclusions.\u201d He said the IAC would consider issues of data quality assurance and control; procedures for correcting errors; and analyzing the IPCC\u2019s communications strategies.\u000a\u000aThe endeavour would be funded by the U.N. and its final report would be submitted to Mr. Ban, the IPCC, with subsequent transmission to the UN Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation.\u000a\u000aOutlining the main purpose of the review Mr. Ban said, \u201cWe need to act based on the best possible science. We need to ensure full transparency, accuracy and objectivity, and minimise the potential for any errors going forward.\u201d

a((VI / United Nations March 11, 2010, 12:20 IST\u000a\u000aThe United Nations has launched an of the functioning of its top climate change body IPCC, which has come under much criticism in the recent months for some errors in its reports.\u000a\u000a"... We need to ensure full transparency, accuracy and objectivity and minimise the potential of any error going forward. I have initiated in tandem with the head of the a comprehensive of the IPCC's procedures and processes," UN Chief Ban Ki-moon told reporters here.\u000a\u000aBan yesterday said, "there were a very small number of errors" in the 3,000 pages of the beleaguered Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's last major synthesis of climate data in 2007.\u000a\u000aThe decision to review was announced by Ban and chair Rajendra Pachauri in the wake of the report which erroneously claimed that Himalayan glaciers would melt away by 2035.\u000a\u000aThe error has also been attributed to a typographical error with the words 2035 appearing instead of 2350.\u000a\u000aBut those errors, which include projections of retreats in Himalayan glaciers, have put public confidence in the Nobel Prize winning panel's work at risk.\u000a\u000a"This review will be conducted by the InterAcademy Council... It will be done completely independent of the United Nations," he said.\u000a\u000aRobbert Dijkgraaf, a Dutch mathematical physicist who co-chairs the group the InterAcademy Council of 15 nations' national academies of science, said, "We enter this process with no preconceived conclusions."\u000a\u000aThe investigations carried out by an independent panel into the procedures and process of the UN climate change panel will be "forward looking", Dijkgraaf told journalists here.\u000a\u000a"Our task is forward looking. We have been requested to recommend measures and actions to ensure the quality of reports in the future," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study is being funded by the UN and the Council will present its findings to the Secretary-General and the secretariat of the IPCC by August this year.\u000a\u000a"We have also been asked to analyze the overall IPCC process including the management, administration and the transparency of the IPCC and the way in which it handles possible errors and communicates them to policymakers and the public," said Dijkgraaf.\u000a\u000aQuestions have been raised about consultancies held by IPCC chair Ranjendra Pachauri and there have been calls for his resignation.\u000a\u000aThe present debacle was preceded by another controversy, referred to as Climategate, which surfaced at the same time as the Climate Change Conference kicked off at Copenhagen in December 2009.\u000a\u000aHackers gained access to the data of the climate research centre of the UK-based East Anglia University and leaked confidential data including thousands of e-mails and documents between British and US.\u000a\u000a"In recent months we have seen some criticism. We are receptive and sensitive to that and we are doing something about it," Pachauri said, adding, "It was in this context that last month the IPCC informed the governments that we would like to carry review of our processes and procedures."

a((VStaff Reporter\u000a\u000aNational Green Tribunal Bill to come before Parliament\u000a\u000aMumbai: Cautioning against \u201cenvironmental propaganda\u201d Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh told journalists here on Saturday that the West was using the science of climate change for political gains.\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh was on a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology (Bombay), where he met heads and faculty of all the seven IITs to discuss the formation of a pan-IIT network to research environment issues.\u000a\u000aIn response to a question on the climate change talks to be held in Mexico later this year, Mr. Ramesh said, \u201cIt's too early to say, but I am not very optimistic simply because the United States will not be in a position to deliver climate change legislation because of their domestic political compulsions. A lot of western politicians like to use the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports for political purposes. We believe in the IPCC as a scientific body and not a political body. We must distinguish climate evangelism from climate science. We support climate science. There is no doubt in my mind that many western countries have distorted and misused IPCC reports to suit political purposes. This, India will never accept. The issue of glaciers is one example.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn terms of a judicial reform in the area of environment, Mr. Ramesh said, the National Green Tribunal Bill would come before Parliament next week. The Bill would empower citizens to go to courts and claim civil damages resulting from flouting of environmental norms by industries and any other body. The Union Cabinet cleared the bill in December 2009, after the Standing Committee examined it and submitted its recommendations in November last.\u000a\u000aIn his address to the faculty and students of IIT, he stressed the need for indigenous research on the impact of climate change on India, because \u201cyou will always have motivated reports,\u201d he said. He went back to an instance where a U.S. report in the 90s stated that methane emissions from Indian wet paddy cultivation was 38 million tonnes per year, resulting in tremendous international pressure on India. However, with the intervention and research of the late Dr. A.P. Mitra it was proved that the emissions were between two to six million tonnes, Mr. Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aHe said because of the dependence on the monsoons for agriculture and demographics, the nation's vulnerability to climate change was the highest in the world.\u000a\u000aBy May this year his Ministry would be releasing an emissions inventory for 2007, to be updated every two years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe last data on emissions dates back to 1994,\u201d he said. In November this year the Ministry is set to come up with a 4/4 assessment report on the impact of climate change. The report would look at four sectors, agriculture, health, water and forests and four regions, the Himalayan ecosystems, the Western Ghats, the North East and the coastal areas.\u000a\u000aThe Ministry also proposed to set up the National Environment Protection Authority (NEPA), on the lines of the Environmental Protection Authority of the U.S. with a view to strengthening the regulatory framework and improving the environmental governance. A study has been awarded to the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, to work out the scope and configuration of the proposed NEPA.\u000a\u000aInstitutional collaboration\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh identified four areas for institutional collaboration, namely, water, cleaner coal, solar energy and Co2 capture and sequestration. The Minister announced the institution of post-doctoral fellowships by September this year to further research in environment sciences. He invited proposals from the IITs on the subject of cleaning the heavily polluted Ganges.\u000a\u000aIn the light of the controversy over Bt brinjal, the Minister called for \u201can interface of science and society.\u201d He said, while a scientific approach to environment was needed, issues \u201chad political and social ramifications. It is impossible to look at scientific issues in isolation. In climate change, science has come into dispute. The distinction between advocacy and science has got blurred.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Ramesh advocated a middle path taking into account the nation's aims of achieving high levels of growth and well as the health of our environment. \u201cGrowth fundamentalism is as bad as ecological fundamentalism. Environment is not a luxury, it's a day-to-day concern,\u201d he said.

a((VClimate Change : REC holders will be entitled to sell power to states,individuals or other trading companies and earn credits for promoting renewable energy generation technologies\u000a\u000aHimachal Pradesh has kicked off another initiative to mitigate climate change issues. It is set to introduce renewable energy certificates (REC),a green tag and credits recognised as “market-based instrument” for promoting clean energy generation and carbon neutrality.\u000a\u000aDirector (Energy) Tarun Kapoor has been appointed as the authority to issue RECs to the agencies engaged in the generation of renewable energy from alternative sources like wind,sun and non-conventional resources. Kapoor is also the Managing Director of Himachal Power Corporation,an energy generation agency for power and renewable energies.\u000a\u000aThe HP State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) finalised the draft notification last week for regulating the concept of issuing RECs and trading by renewable energy generators.\u000a\u000aHPSERC Chairman Yogesh Khanna said the REC entitled its holders to sell power to states,individuals or other trading companies and earn credits for promoting renewable energy generation technologies without causing harm to the climate.\u000a\u000aThe Central government is learnt to have already set up a national registry under the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) where certificate holders can register themselves for future trading. “The agency will also monitor the supply of power to various states. This system will gradually create a market (demand and supply mechanism) for the sale of power across the geographical boundaries of states,” said Khanna.\u000a\u000aThe Union Ministry of Power has already given its go-ahead to the states for introducing RECs. Till now,only a few states like Maharashtra and Gujarat have taken the lead in this direction. Himachal will be first northern hill state to set up the agency,according to a senior official in the regulatory commission who is working on climate change initiatives.\u000a\u000aThe commission proposes to fix floor rates for the sale of renewable energy to the buyers outside Himachal. To facilitate the system,the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power Exchange of India have already become operational. The National Thermal Power Corporation is reportedly planning a third exchange.\u000a\u000aPrincipal Secretary (Power) Deepak Shanan said: “The initiative will put Himachal in the category of those select states that are promoting renewable energy and are conscious about climate change and carbon neutrality issues. There is not much awareness on the issue at present but things will gradually change.”\u000a\u000aLast month,Dr Rajan Kapoor,a Himachal-born leading alternate energy expert based in the US,had met Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and top power department officials to help the state draw a roadmap to encash on the renewable energy sources. Kapoor,who runs “invVEST”,an organisation founded in Colorado (US),told The Indian Express: “Our vision is to promote sustainable energy on a massive scale through people’s involvement and create a vibrant economy without adverse affects on the climate and global warming.”\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App

a((VBEIJING: Chinese premier Wen Jiabao indicated on Sunday he was snubbed by leaders of developed countries during the Copenhagen climate change summit. He was not given an invitation for the small-scope meeting although China's name figured in the list of countries invited to it, he said.Wen said he came to know of the meeting when the "leader of an emerging country" sent his staff to inform him about it while he was at a banquet hosted by Danish Queen on December 17. He did not name the country, but it could be India or Brazil who had agreed with China to coordinate their moves at the summit."I was shocked as I had received no notification that China was invited," Wen said while explaining his absence at the meeting. He was accused in some circles for sending a junior minister on his behalf at a meeting attended by European leaders and US president Barack Obama.He did not directly say he felt insulted but suggested the snub may have come because China had taken a stand against developed countries. "We are fully justified to stick to the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities,'" he said.Wen said he decided to stay away when he learnt that even the Chinese delegation had not been invited. He asked Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi to talk to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about it."We haven't received any explanation until now. It's still a mystery to me," Wen said. "We are fully justified to stick to the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities,'" he said."The issue of climate change concerns human survival, the interests of all countries, and equity and justice in our international communities," he said. "It still perplexes me why some people keep trying to make an issue about China (in this regard)," he said.

a((VEven after the meetings in December last year failed to deliver, the UK's special representative for international trade and investment, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, today continued the promote the paradigm that the developing world should partner with developed states in addressing climate change.\u000a\u000aHowever, taking the argument forward, he called for greater collaboration between governments and the private sector to push for a global low-carbon economy that would be profitable for businesses.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe global market for low carbon and environmental goods and services was worth 3 trillion pound in 2008. As international action on climate change gathers momentum, this could grow to an estimated 4.3 billion pounds by 2015,\u201d he said at a seminar organised by CII and UK Trade & Investment (UKTI).\u000a\u000aBy providing the UK's blueprint for capitalising on the low-carbon business opportunity, which includes investment in education and research and development into newer technologies, Andrew tacitly hinted that countries like India should look at harnessing their academic research better.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany of our new generation of low-carbon have been born directly out of university research, operating at the forefront of nano-technology, bio-technology and computer science,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFor instance, Oxford university is working with Delta Motorsports for developing a high-performance electric vehicle, while Bath Univerity is collaborating with industry on high-tech materials which absorb and treat carbon.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn addition, the track record of Cambridge and Oxford universities and Imperial College London in commercialising their research and transferring it from the lab bench to the market place is among the best in the word,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAs for domestic industry, Andrew said that UK firms had already been active in India and, in particular, pushed for greater cooperation in the energy sector. \u201cI am aware that coal plays a key role in India's energy mix and is going to be the main source of energy for the foreseeable future. There is an increasing interest in cleaner coal technologies, another area where Indian and UK have been working together. The UK has expertise in almost all parts of the coal value chain,\u201d he said.

The carbon audit and the Carbon Neutral Master Plan are due to be completed during 2010.\u000a\u000aAs per the statement CTBR will then assist the Maldivian Government, when requested, to secure international finance and investors to implement the various projects, such as wind farms, waste recycling plants, sustainable transport solutions, foreseen in the Master Plan. The projects will be conceived, structured and implemented as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Finance will be sourced from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IFC, private investors and international markets.\u000a\u000aIt quoted President Nasheed as saying after the inking of the agreement, \u201cThe Maldives wants to set an example, by demonstrating that a country can develop without having to pollute the planet. After all, it is not carbon we want but development, it is not coal we want but electricity, it is not oil we want but transport. The Maldives aims to grow but we want our growth to be green.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith the 250 year old financial expertise and reach of the Rothschilds, and the environmental know-how of BeCitizen, I am confident this partnership will enable the Maldives to make rapid inroads into its national carbon footprint.\u201d\u000a\u000aBenjamin & Ariane de Rothschild told the gathering on the occasion, \u201cWe congratulate the Maldives Government and the people of Maldives on their ambition to become one of the first states to be Carbon Neutral. Such a statement of intent is not only important for reasons of moral leadership in tackling climate change - the greatest challenge facing the world today - but also because it places the Maldives at the head of the pack in the transition to a low-carbon world.\u000a\u000a\u201cTogether, the joint efforts of the Maldives government, its people, and The Edmond de Rothschild Group will make this ambitious objective a reality by 2020.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Edmond de Rothschild Group is convinced that, as well as helping Maldives becoming carbon neutral, the partnership will spur domestic economic growth and new revenue-generating business opportunities for the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn March 2009, President Nasheed announced the Maldives\u2019 intention of becoming the world\u2019s first carbon neutral country by 2020.

The municipal corporation was also dumping untreated water into the sea creating problems to those who wanted to set up new industries or wanted to expand their facilities there,he said.\u000a\u000aGohil said around 350 posts of engineers were vacant in the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and no recruitment had been done since 1997. He also accused the Essar and Adani groups of destroying the mangrove forests on the coastal region of Mundra,saying that the government should claim two per cent carbon credit from industrialists and use the money for the betterment of the people living in the proximity of polluting units.\u000a\u000aThe government was not acting on a report on carbon footprints and pollution in Gujarat since 2002,he said.\u000a\u000aCongress MLA Bavku Undhad said the Sabarmati and Khari rivers had become highly polluted. Plastic bags used for bori bunds were also polluting the rivers,he said.\u000a\u000aHe criticised the government for failing to reduce unemployment. Statistics from comparative official data revealed that the number of educated unemployed youth had gone up from 5,93,155 in 1990 to 7,86,740 in 2009,he said.\u000a\u000aGohil said,in the past,big units were asked to set up facilities in the backward regions,but the Modi government had offered land to the Tatas in Ahmedabad under a special policy. He said the Below Poverty Line (BPL) criteria had also lost its meaning and it was shameful that an independent agency like the CAG should point out the losses of over Rs 21 crore to the state .\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App

a((VThe threat of is now overwhelming the dialogue on Forests, like other ecosystems, will be affected by temperature increase. But the dimension that is receiving much more attention is their role as a store for Forests hold more than the atmosphere, and the interchange of between the two is a major element in the climate debate. Forest loss accounted for 20 per cent of carbon emissions, according to the (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and reducing this is seen as a low-cost way of mitigating the threat of\u000a\u000aThese climate concerns will lead to greatly-expanded international funding for forestry. It is under discussion in UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) under the heading Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), and the has already established two windows for climate-related forestry projects.\u000a\u000aWe see the beginnings of this shift in the (National Action Plan on Climate Change) mission on The Ministry of Environment and Forests is getting into the act and according to a recent study put out by it, the carbon sequestered in India\u2019s forests rose by about 138 mt of CO2 equivalent per year between 1995 and 2005, and \u201cneutralised\u201d about 9 per cent of our year 2000 level of\u000a\u000aA measure of caution is required in shifting the focus of forestry just to carbon sequestration. It could be as distorting as the earlier focus on production forestry. Consider the experience of India with \u201cscientific forestry\u201d set up after the British brought in three German foresters to establish the forest department and the forest institute in Dehra Dun. Sustainable working plans were prepared for the forests which were brought under government control and removals were calibrated to match annual increments in forest stock. But this did not prevent large-scale forest loss with surviving dense forests found only in inaccessible areas.\u000a\u000aAn even bigger distortion was the alienation of forest communities that were treated as interlopers. Moreover, since sustainability was defined in terms of maintenance of growing stock, there was also a monomaniacal obsession with replanting quicker-growing species with little regard to other ecological consequences. Thus, the replacement of broad-leaved oaks with pines in the Himalayas altered the water retention capacity of forests for the worse.\u000a\u000aForests are part of a wider ecosystem and deliver services that are far more than forest products even from the perspective of For instance, forests play a role in hydrology and could be an important element in coping with the impact of climate change on precipitation and river flows.\u000a\u000aForests are not empty land. There are 173,000 villages in or near forests. For people in these villages, forests are a source of livelihood and cultural value. For them, diversity matters as they have a use for many species, some for food, some for liquor, some as host plants for silk worms and so on. Their goal is a sustainable livelihood based on forest resources, not growing stock or carbon sequestration.\u000a\u000aOver the past few decades, we have seen a healthy shift in with a stronger emphasis on conservation, including a ban on logging in many places, on biodiversity and wildlife protection, and on community rights with the spread of joint forest management. My fear is that the large sums of international money that will become available as part of the climate change mitigation effort will undo many of these gains.\u000a\u000aThe focus on growing stock led to the destruction of biodiversity as fast-growing and commercially-attractive species replaced native trees. Will the emphasis on the role of forests in climate change lead to an excessive focus on species that are most efficient in carbon capture? Will this be sufficiently restrained by pious language about sustainable development?\u000a\u000aThe promotion of \u201cscientific\u201d forestry led to the shift of control to large forest departments and the marginalisation of forest communities. It also opened up forests to large companies. Will this also happen with carbon sequestration forestry projects as international donors may find it easier to work with large public and private organisations rather than with small local communities?\u000a\u000aThe major difficulty in forest development has always been the fact that those who bear the cost of forest protection and management cannot monetise the value of the preserved forest to others. The ecosystem services of forests in the form of water regulation, biodiversity, landscape quality and so on are not readily marketable. In this situation, foresters are tempted by the smell of money for at least one ecosystem service, that of carbon sequestration.\u000a\u000aCarbon funding for forestry is going to come. There is no point in fighting this. What we have to do is to make this one-dimensional funding objective consistent with other goals for forestry policy and with decentralisation and empowerment of forest communities. Hence I would propose that carbon funding for forestry should include a biodiversity bonus, a water regulation bonus, and a community rights bonus. Thus, all such funding, whether it is channelled through a carbon credit mechanism or through straightforward public funding, should give more for carbon sequestration if this is done in a manner that conserves biodiversity and protects wildlife, that maintains or improves the water regulation properties of the forest and that shares management responsibility and returns with local forest communities.\u000a\u000aCalculating these bonuses does pose measurement problems and will require a great deal of creativity. But even the calculation of the quantity of carbon sequestered by different types of species in varying growing conditions poses similar measurement problems. A bigger issue is the willingness of carbon credit buyers to pay the bonuses. If they are commercial entities buying these as offsets for their own obligations, then they may well refuse to pay extra for goals that are of no monetary value to them. But if the funding is from public sources, as proposed by some potential donors, then this is a less serious problem. Maybe this is a good reason for keeping carbon funding for forestry outside the commercial framework of carbon credit markets.\u000a\u000aOne final thought \u2014 what happens to our forests will depend not just on the but also on the way in which mining, energy, agriculture and human settlement policies contain the pressure on forest lands, and carbon funding for forestry will have little impact on these other areas of the policy.\u000a\u000anitin-desai@hotmail.com

The new bottle looks the same as ever but weighs 835 grams instead of 900 grams. That means vehicles transporting it will require less fuel.\u000a\u000aThe committee says the change will cut carbon dioxide output by 8,000 metric tons a year, which it likens to the annual emissions of 4,000 cars.\u000a\u000aThe industry worked with glassmakers on the new bottles to ensure they can hold up under the pressure of the bubbles. Until the late 19th century, champagne bottles often exploded from that pressure -- a problem that went away as glassmaking techniques improved.\u000a\u000aSome vintners have begun using the new bottles already and are pleased with the results, said Sonia Smith, director of the Champagne Bureau, which represents the champagne industry association in the United States.\u000a\u000aBased on a 2002 environmental impact assessment, France's champagne industry has set a target of cutting its carbon footprint by 25 per cent by 2020.

a((VNEW DELHI: Parliament security has said it is ready to let in members on bicycles, in what can add a novel feature to the transport system among politicians.Security authorities have veered round to the view that not much needs to be done to make the system, geared for four-wheelers, bicycle-compatible. Sources said security staff can just establish the identity of MPs at the entrance while letting the bicycle in.Authorities are looking for a designated parking slot for cycles . Sources said the `RF tag', which ensures genuineness of the car registered against an MP, may not come into play in case of cycles. After bicycles are let in, they can be put to anti-sabotage tests.It may bring to fruition a fledgling attempt by some MPs to let their "transport" raise awareness about climate change. They made the request to Speaker Meira Kumar recently and the latter liked the idea enough to order quick action. "It is only a few MPs right now, but I am sure it will catch on," she told TOI. Even if it was symbolic, she said symbols played a big role in raising awareness.A beginning is surely on the cards. Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD MP from Cuttack, welcomed it. "I expect the MPs to come to Parliament on cycles at least once a week," he told TOI. He said the request is aimed at helping raise awareness about climate while reducing congestion on Delhi roads. "Finally, it is also about physical fitness," he said.Delhi roads may not be the safest for cyclists, now known as a poor man's transport, but Mahtab feels the Parliament move can improve it. "It is time we created awareness on traffic sense and safeguarded the right of way of cyclists," he said.Rajiv Pratap Rudy of BJP, member-convenor of parliamentary forum on climate change, said cycle was an eco-friendly mode of transport and hoped the security found a way out. Delhi roads, he said, may make the move symbolic. But he added that another suggestion for `green cars' as ferry vehicles in Parliament was a practical step and a welcome idea.

The event was organised by United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) with the support of Ministry of Environment, Government of Japan.City mayor Kanaji Thakore also signed the Kyoto Declaration'. The declaration aims at motivating Asian cities to demonstrate effective leadership and initiate concrete measures to make cities clean, green and environment and people friendly through integrated environmentally sustainable transport strategies and measures. Ahmedabad is now among 44 cities from across the globe to sign the declaration.According to a senior AMC official, Janmarg was shown to illustrate recent innovative initiative and good practices in fuel efficiency and climate change mitigation in the transport sector.The forum saw participation from 10 mayors from Asian cities including Thakore.According to UNCRD, the transport sector is emerging as the fastest growing source of energy related green house gas (GHG) emission accounting for more than 23 per cent of those emissions in 2006, road transport accounts for three quarters of all transport GHG emissions. GHG emissions are harmful to human health.There are more 18 lakhs vehicles running on city roads adding to GHG emissions."A whole range of issues to enhance public transport and curb GHG, public private partnerships, financing public transport, and business models for green growth, among others were discussed," added the official.

Later, they took an oath that "they would protect Mother Earth, reduce pollution and conserve energy''."It's a pledge we all must take,'' said Ishani Pruthi, first year student of PGP. "It's not just about saving electricity. One needs to take environment holistically...be it power, or even the ground water depletion. Just everything matters,'' said IIM-L Prof, Debashis Dasgupta.The initiative was a part of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) campaign that began in Sydney (Australia) in 2007, when over two million people switched off the lights for an hour to convey their support for action on climate change.In 2008, the campaign went global with over 50 million people in 371 cities across 35 countries taking part in it. Then in 2009, more than 4,000 cities and towns, 20,000 companies, 8,000 schools, 5,500 organisations in 88 countries participated in Earth Hour, which reached nearly one billion people.For 2010, the campaign has already been launched in India on March 10 in New Delhi by chief minister Sheila Dixit. At IIM-L, it is the forward interest group in Food and Agri-business (IGFAB) which is conducting the Save Electricity Campaign in association with WWF.Meanwhile, IGFAB also came up with a video presentation at a Mall near Hazratganj to sensitise people about the need to save electricity so as to prevent global warming and its subsequent effects on human life.Media Cell of the institute said that both the events received an enthusiastic response in terms of participation and involvement from IIM Lucknow students community and the people of the city.

a((VGURGAON: Illegal mining and the felling of trees are not the only reasons why the Aravalis are fast losing their forest cover. The other, perhaps the biggest, problem is the government's plantation schemes which are grossly inadequate for the sustainable development of green cover.Under Haryana's plantation schemes, funds are allotted for the watering of saplings only three times a year as compared to the Delhi government's norms which provide funds for the watering of saplings three times a week during the first year of plantation.This was recently revealed in an answer to an RTI application. Senior forest officials say this is because of an archaic law formulated 40-50 years ago when climatic conditions were very different from now and when Haryana got more rainfall and its water tables were higher. Now, because of drastic changes in both, the survival rate of plantations has plummeted to 20-25% from an earlier 70-75%."Under the government's urban forestry scheme, about Rs 16,000 is allotted per `running kilometre' for the care of 166 saplings. The scheme stipulates that saplings be watered a maximum of three times a year. The Centre's forest development scheme allots Rs 12,800 per hectare, using which we are required to water plants twice a year," said D K Sinha, conservator of forests, Gurgaon.Forest officials say the norms need severe revision. "We have been writing to higher authorities asking that changes be made to policy because conditions have changed completely. The region is getting more arid by the day because of scanty rainfall, which leads to depleting water tables, and because of which it has become difficult for plants to survive," Sinha said.Other factors are also responsible for the depletion of forest cover. "Since most areas of the region are managed by local communities and panchayats, the forest department cannot develop them the way it wants to. Grazing and tree felling are also rampant," Sinha added.Forest officials said the funds crunch has also affected the quality of trees planted. "Earlier we used to plant dhak, dhok, khairy, ronjh, hingota, salar, gugal, mesquite, papri saplings, which had high leaf cover and timber value. Now we plant only wild trees like the keekar which have low leaf cover and no timber value," said Devendra Rao, forest range officer, Gurgaon range.If the survival rate of plantations is less than 70%, lower-rung officials are made scapegoats, and the lost money recovered from them by cutting their salaries. "It is difficult to carry out operations like earth works, soil preparation, weeding, water supply, etc with the meagre funds we get," said Rao.Environmentalists, meanwhile, express concern. "At a time when issues like global warming and climate change are on top of every country's agenda even our own politicians and officials are talking about the adverse effects of deforestation the information released by the forest department shows the government is not serious about the issue," said Vivek Kamboj, an environmentalist."It is very important to plant saplings, but our responsibility does not end there. We have to make certain the saplings are kept alive and healthy. Which will not happen if immediate measures are not taken to change existing laws," said Kamboj.Environmentalists said the existing norms are not really helping the state's efforts to increase Haryana's forest cover. "While the National Forest Policy says that ideally every state should have 33% of its area under forest cover, Haryana scores a dismal 7% on that point. The state did not even meet the 10% target which it had set for itself," Kamboj added.

a((VCHENNAI: Tamil Nadu , which has been reeling under power shortage, is yet to embrace eco-friendly technology in a big way to save electricity consumption.While nearly 11.5 lakh Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL, better known as energy saving light) have been distributed to households in Haryana, Chattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh under the "Bachat Lamp Yojna"(BLY), Tamil Nadu has still not implemented the scheme due to the lack of suppliers for the lamp. The state has over one crore domestic electricity consumers.Some companies had applied for the tender to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) which is handling the BLY scheme for the state, for supplying the lamps. But nothing concrete has emerged yet."One of the major factors is quality of the lamps supplied. Most of them are not meeting the standards. Then there is the cost factor involved. The suppliers have to first distribute the lamps and claim their money back on a cost recovery basis (claiming carbon credits after supplying to the consumer). We heard that the suppliers conducted a survey in Coimbatore and other districts and found that not many people are interested in changing the lamps. We have not got any proper reply from them directly," said a senior TNEB official.A senior official of the Union power ministry pointed out that a few days ago the Union minister of state for power; Bharatsinh Solanki had informed the Rajya Sabha that four lakh bulbs in Yamunanagar, Haryana and in Rajnandgaon District, Chhattisgarh respectively and 3.5 lakhs bulbs in Vizag, Andhra Pradesh have been distributed under the BLY.A few days ago, union minister of state for power Bharatsinh Solanki had informed the Rajya Sabha that Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Tripura and Karnataka have shown interest in participating in the BLY. But Tamil Nadu is no where in the picture.In India, the lighting needs of the domestic sector are met by incandescent bulbs which are extremely energy inefficient. Nearly 95% of the electricity is converted in heat and just 5% is used for lighting. Lighting accounts for about 20% of electricity consumption and by use of CFL lighting the load can be reduced without compromising on the lumen output.Under the BLY scheme 60 Watt and 100 Watt incandescent lamps have to be replaced with 11 to15 Watt and 20 -25 Watt CFLs respectively. The CFLs will be distributed to the households by the suppliers themselves at Rs 15 per bulb which will be compensated to the CFL supplier by harnessing Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol (claiming carbon credits).If the scheme takes off in Tamil Nadu at this juncture when it is facing a power crisis, it would be of great help for the State. "There are nearly 1 crore domestic consumers in the State and if each of them save power, hundreds of MWs can be saved. But we do not have the funds to do it ourselves," said the TNEB official.

a((VUpdated: Sun, Mar 21 2010. 09 27 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: India plans to offer monsoon prediction and climate modelling services to neighbours such as Nepal, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in a bid to access valuable data from these countries and put its recently procured supercomputing systems to use.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough we have good scientists and are upgrading our infrastructure, we need data from other countries,\u201d said an official familiar with the matter, who didn\u2019t want to be identified.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo that end we can develop forecasts for them and maybe over time, get some return on our supercomputing investments,\u201d the official added.\u000a\u000aThe systems were procured at a cost of $28 million (Rs127.4 crore) from International Business Machines Corp. They were installed at various climate research institutes, including the Delhi headquarters of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Key officials from the ministry of earth sciences (MoES) are expected to meet delegates South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (Saarc) nations in Pune next month for a conference for preliminary discussions. Saarc groups Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\u000a\u000aThe weather data that India is looking to access will help improve the accuracy of its global circulation models (GCMs), two MoES officials said. GCMs are next-generation weather forecasting systems on which scientists simulate the atmosphere at any given point of time and run the resultant data on powerful computing machines that try extrapolating weather behaviour over the next few months.\u000a\u000aAlthough GCMs allow accurate forecasts over a week, they often fail in predicting monsoon trends even over a month\u2019s span. In 2008, GCM models predicted south India will witness only three-quarters of normal rainfall. The region posted a 25% excess.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are still weaknesses in this approach (GCM). That\u2019s why we still depend on the statistical data. But given that there\u2019s a worldwide push to GCM forecasting, we must improve this approach. For that we need a continuous flow of high quality data,\u201d said D.S. Pai, director (forecasting) at India Meteorological Department, Pune.\u000a\u000aIMD still relies heavily on statistical models in preparing its monsoon forecasts, though since 2004, it has gradually started incorporating results from locally developed GCMs too.\u000a\u000aOther officials also see India\u2019s initiative as a strategic step. A key objective of the conference in Pune is to help develop a Saarc monsoon model and the World Meteorological Organization has tasked India with taking the lead in the region.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe WMO has asked us to take the initiative. Our key objective will be to improve our observation systems, gather better data and use that to improve our own monsoon forecasts,\u201d said Shailesh Naik, secretary, MoES.\u000a\u000aBetter models will also help better forecast the impact of climate change and its effects over South Asia. In the absence of quality data generated locally, policy makers and scientists have often relied on predictions made by Western institutions on the impact of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat could be useful given that we are in the process of strengthening our in-house modelling capabilities and trying to depend less on Western predictions of climate change,\u201d said M. Rajeevan, a climate specialist with the Indian Space Research Organisation.

a((VBetween 1950 and 2004, the Indian roads sector has grown at an average annual rate of 4.64%, whereas motor vehicles have grown at a rate of 10.94%. Several indicators on roads and roads transport indicate that India is far behind other emerging countries. The government is aware of the mismatch between demand and supply of roads. As a result, road development has become the highest priority of the Government of India, with 79% of the Eleventh Five Year Plan infrastructure budget being allocated to the roads sector.\u000a\u000aThe fact that we are falling behind our road building targets is a story for another day. Another statistic of interest to our story here is that India is the fourth largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions in the world, but its per-capita emissions are very low. Transport sector is the second-largest sector contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in India. We can always choose to be sceptical about global warming forecasts, but the ironical part about climate change is that if the average temperature in the world actually increases, we will bear the burden of those changes and not the developed countries.\u000a\u000aWe have two paths open to us in our road building endeavours. One is the business-as-usual path or we can take the less travelled routebuilding a green road network. It is important to make an optimum decision at the outset, as we are going to be locked into that investment for a substantial period of time. Further, as the US is discovering, it is very difficult and costly to change habits and overhaul infrastructure from top to bottom.\u000a\u000aBuilding a green road network involves both changes in attitudes and planning right at the beginning. I want to illustrate my point about changes in attitudes using the Delhi road network. For example, if you want to signal that you belong to the higher social class in Delhi, what do you do - buy cars, bigger the better. The fact that Delhi drivers think they are James Deanrebels without a causeonly adds to the traffic woes.\u000a\u000aObviously, it does not help the cause of a green road transport network if the public transportation system sucks. As a result, people are forced to buy cars as a mode of transportation. Then people choose to travel alone in their cars, which add to the jam. Instead, carpooling needs to be encouraged by the government as a sensible, green practice. Carpooling reduces our carbon footprint in this world (and increases mental peace since one is not driving and cursing). Even non-regular users are forced to buy cars, occupying scarce parking space. Maybe we can adopt the concept of Zipcar, like in big cities in the US. In the Zipcar, one can rent a car for a few hours. Perhaps, the Zipcar in India can come with a driver. As a further disincentive for driving, the Indian government is thinking of imposing congestion fees. Secondly, we need to think about roads and roads transport in a holistic framework. They are two separate sectors, but joined at the hip. Using the Delhi urban roads as an example, building roads should be part of an urban planning process.\u000a\u000aLet us think about the new urban planning, now so popular in the West. That concept is nothing but re-discovering the co-existence of residence and markets. That means one does not have to take the car to go grocery shopping every time. In India, we already have that in existence, in an informal manner. Perhaps we can make it formal. We do not have to make separate trips to home and then shops. We can just stop in the market on the way to home. The convenience of buying groceries from the carts is irreplaceable.\u000a\u000aComing to markets, there is very little provision for parking or for people selling fruits and vegetables on the carts. Everybody just mills about on the main roads with cars parked everywhere and one tries to get through the traffic without hitting or getting hit by somebody. We may want to develop a model for markets that takes into account local habits and above concerns.\u000a\u000aRoads also need footpaths where pedestrians can walk. Unfortunately, most of the cars are typically parked on the footpaths, resulting in the pedestrians and bicyclists using one lane. It is so clogged up that people prefer to bring cars because it is impossible to walk or cross roads, resulting in more jams! If we had paid parking on streets, regulations for building parking inside houses and congestion fees, this scenario might change.\u000a\u000aWhile designing roads, we may want to think about incorporating traffic lights in our designs or anything that will make it easier for pedestrians to cross roads. The idea is that people should choose to walk to their neighbourhood markets rather than drive to them. Or, if people are picking up groceries on the way home, they should be able to do so conveniently without creating traffic jams.\u000a\u000aMost important, we may want to introduce speed limits within roads. That may bring security to neighbourhoods petrified of speeding cars. As a result, some of the inner streets may be opened up. The inner streets may only be opened in a selective manner to small vehicles like two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws and non-motorised traffic. All these may result in taking the pressure off the main streets.\u000a\u000aA sustainable road network in India will connect people smoothly without people always worrying whether this is their last day on earth every time they venture out on the roads. It will encourage people to walk or cycle short distances and use public transport or cars for long distances.\u000a\u000aFor that we need good quality roads that are well-maintained. However, road building activity may not be just limited to laying the roads and maintaining them, but also building footpath, subways, traffic lights, etc. Further, it also involves building market places thinking of Indian habits. A good green road network also involves making rules for driving on the roads, which cause minimal losses to human life, national income and our environment. It is necessary to ensure that the traffic rules are implemented. Perhaps technology can play a part in that.\u000a\u000aWe can also continue on the business-as-usual path. The problem is that with the rapid rise in the number of motor vehicles and scarce land, residents face trade-offs like the need to convert public parks to public parking places in the future. The Indian public at least should think about the options, the costs and benefits associated with each path of road building. Unfortunately, climate change is not fair, but hard choices will have to be made. It will be either now or in the future.\u000a\u000aThe writer is Fellow, NCAER. The views expressed are personal

a((VNEW DELHI: If the climate talks weren't already confounding enough and full of intrigue for the rest to follow, here is another aspect of it emerging in India. Industry lobby groups are getting along with other experts to kickstart track-II diplomacy with the US.The move has been initiated by Aspen Strategy Group, supported by the Confederation of Indian Industries, and will have names like Nitin Desai, member of the PM's council on climate change, and Kirit Parikh, retired Planning Commission member and co-author of the Integrated Energy Policy from the Indian side. Industrialist Jamshyd N Godrej along with Tarun Das of Aspen India are taking the lead from India and Navroz Dubash with the Centre for Policy Research is also on board.While the government is not directly represented, the presence of several individuals who are also members of various climate related committees of the government including Nitin Desai, who is on the apex body -- the PM's council -- could lend weight to the talks.Desai, when asked about the initiative, told TOI that he is in favour of discrete closed-door talks as well as open dialogue. He said track-II talks with the US held quietly would help explore options beyond entrenched existingpositions. He said there were different advantages to both formats.But some confusion about the character of the talks initiated by Aspen and CII remain with one member of the formation, not wishing to be named, said that he had was willing to join only if the talks were done in a more open fashion and by broadening the base of participants rather than sticking to the few already enlisted.Yet another enlisted member admitted that with lack of trust and a general suspicion in the air about India changing its climate stance rapidly over the past year the track-II approach needed to be taken carefully in order to not raise doubts about its purpose.Union environment and forest ministry officials while claiming they were aware of the move said that they were not involved with the process. Tarun Das and Jamshyd N Godrej, the two leading the intitiative, remained unavailable for comment.

a((VMANGALORE: In a major step aimed at saving electricity, the Palakkad division of Southern Railway has gone in for the use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) in a big way. The authorities of the division have replaced all incandescent lamps (ordinary bulbs) and replaced them with CFL in all residential quarters in the division right from Mangalore Central up to Madhukarai under clean development mechanism.A Southern Railway press release here on Saturday stated that as part of the energy saving drive and to reduce energy consumption, the division has embarked on this 'green' drive. When the energy consumption is reduced, carbon emission from the lamp will be less and that will help to reduce the carbon in the environment. Four CFLs are distributed to each quarter and the division has replaced totally about 9,000 CFLs free of cost.Philips Company manufactures these CFLs and they have a life of 10,000 burning hours. It will save around 13,500 units of electric energy per month in Palakkad division. These lamps are provided to use in high usage areas in the home such as living room, kitchen, bedroom and dining room to give maximum benefit. Southern Railway has taken a conscious decision to replace bulbs in all its five divisions and replace them with CFLs.

While per-capita emissions are still low, demand for electricity and fossil fuels is increasing as the middle class clamours for more cars, TVs and better housing.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Indian economy is not concerned at all with climate change ... and follows the business-as-usual path, the reality is even in business-as-usual we have to change from what we are today,\u201d Parikh told Reuters in an interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are your imperatives in any way from your energy security point of view because we are very short of oil, very short of gas.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to find in the next 20, at the most 30 years, an alternative to coal-based power plants. That will be required in a business-as-usual scenario.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn India, any talk of a low-carbon economy was once seen as politically very risky, given the economic costs involved. But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in January asked Parikh to begin charting a path to a greener economy.\u000a\u000aThe panel\u2019s preliminary report is due in April and the final submission in September.\u000a\u000aAlthough, India has announced a new climate plan which identifies renewable energy, such as solar power, as a key element, coal remains the backbone of energy supply in a country where almost half the 1.1 billion population has no access to electricity.\u000a\u000aThe country has 10% of the world\u2019s coal reserves, the biggest after the United States, Russia and China. Most of India\u2019s coal is inferior in quality and highly polluting.\u000a\u000aAbout 70 million tonnes of coal is imported each year, mostly for making steel.\u000a\u000aIndia plans to add 78.7 gigawatts of power generation during the five years ending March 2012, most of it from coal, which now accounts for about 60% of the nation\u2019s energy mix.\u000a\u000aHigher efficiency spurs higher demand\u000a\u000aBy comparison, renewables such as wind, solar and biomass contribute only 8.8% to generation and, though there are plans to scale up solar power generation to 20 gigawatts by 2022, it depends on international finance and technology.\u000a\u000aA landmark nuclear deal with the United States might herald a new chapter in clean energy in India, but long planning and building periods for nuclear reactors and high cost are deterrents.\u000a\u000aParikh said given the dependence on coal, the only way forward was to enhance the efficiency of coal-based power plants by using technology such as super-critical boilers which would help cut coal use by about 20%.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, half of my plants should be more efficient. In another 10 years, 75% of the plants should be more efficient,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIndia last year set a goal for slowing the growth of its emissions, saying it will try to rein in its \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d - the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output - by between 20 and 25% by 2020, from 2005 levels.\u000a\u000aParikh said the target was achievable without a major shift in policy keeping in view the fact that India\u2019s energy intensity - the amount of energy used to produce one unit of GDP - has been coming down.\u000a\u000aHe said it was too early to estimate the economic cost of shifting to a low-carbon economy and the panel would initially only identify areas of opportunities such as in the power, transport and construction sectors.\u000a\u000aParikh said increasing energy efficiency was not enough because enhanced efficiency would lead to higher energy demands.\u000a\u000a\u201d ... activities become more productive, larger value-adding takes place, incomes go up, people demand more, growth takes place and the total energy demand goes up,\u201c he said.

Every IPCC report should include a separate chapter including all divergent views. In fact, the entire draft report should be sent to all known \u201cclimate sceptics\u201d during the review process, says the Indian note.\u000a\u000aIt also suggests an extra tier of scrutiny to review the \u201cconclusions\u201d emerging from the facts, in order to ensure objectivity, especially with regard to the influential Summary for Policymakers.\u000a\u000aThese are some of the suggestions contained in a note prepared by the Union Ministry for Environment and Forests, and sent to the co-chairs of the Inter Academy Council, a group of eminent scientists who have been asked to review the IPCC's processes. This independent review was commissioned after the IPCC came under severe fire for inaccuracies in its Fourth Assessment Report, including a false prediction that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile IPCC cannot be blamed for misuse of its findings by political leaders with their own agenda or by the media in search of headlines, there certainly are areas relating to the IPCC's working in which improvements can and should be made,\u201d wrote Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh in the letter accompanying the note, dated March 22.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC should ensure that \u201cgrey literature\u201d \u2014 information published in reports by governmental, global and non-governmental agencies \u2014 does not to carry the same weight as peer-reviewed scientific papers, says the note. Last-minute ideas that did not go through the comprehensive review process of the original draft should not be pushed through at the final draft stage.\u000a\u000aIndia called for complete transparency. Everything \u2014 from the CVs of the scientists selected and rejected as experts, to all the literature cited in the reports, to all data and assumptions used for running climate models and projections \u2014 should be made available in the public domain on the IPCC website.\u000a\u000a\u201c[The] Need for confidentiality on contents during the IPCC report preparation is appreciated, but [the] need for extensive confidentiality on the process is not warranted.

The government has now officially taken note of the internal criticism and asked for, besides other things, to put an end to the \u2018inbreeding\u2019 in IPCC with a single scientist or group of scientists hogging space in the document at the cost of alternate and sometimes contrasting science from authors with differing views.In a note forwarded by the minister, the government has suggested that opportunity should be given to include contrary opinions on the conclusions that IPCC draws \u2014 pointing to the criticism the scientific panel often faces of blocking views that question the accuracy or certainty of their findings.

a((VUpdated: Tue, Mar 23 2010. 08 34 PM IST\u000a\u000aJust weeks after India\u2019s biofuel policy appeared in December, commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma denounced the diversion of foodgrain to biofuels at the World Economic Forum in Davos. India wants 20% biofuel content in vehicle fuel by 2017, but turning cheap food into expensive fuel pushes up food prices and damages the environment.\u000a\u000aA leaked World Bank paper on the 2007-08 food crisis said US and European Union (EU) biofuel contributed at least 70% to the price rise\u2014against 3% admitted by the US department of agriculture. The World Bank\u2019s Food Price Index doubled between 2006 and 2008. India\u2019s food inflation is high, at around 16%. But despite a backlash in 2008, biofuels are still in favour.\u000a\u000aBiofuel subsidies are about political pandering, not cutting greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aBiofuels from crops such as maize, sugar and palm oil have more than tripled since 2000. The US and the EU have set themselves ambitious targets: an increase from the current 9 billion litres to 15 billion litres of ethanol by 2012 for the US, and 5.75% of transport fuel by the end of 2010 for the EU.\u000a\u000aBy 2022, US subsidies will have totalled $400 billion, according to Friends of the Earth. The EU is no better, with around \u20ac3.7 billion ($5.2 billion) in 2007. India\u2019s new national biofuel policy promises subsidies but offers no figures yet.\u000a\u000aOn top of wasted taxes and higher food prices, many biofuels make little environmental sense: Production can release more emissions than it avoids. Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul J. Crutzen estimates: \u201cFor rapeseed biodiesel, which accounts for about 80% of the biofuel production in Europe, the relative warming due to N2O (nitrous oxide) emissions is estimated at 1-1.7 times larger than the quasi-cooling effect due to saved fossil CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. For corn bioethanol, dominant in the US, the figure is 0.9-1.5.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor do all biofuels save energy. Some varieties require as much to grow, transport and process as they release when burnt.\u000a\u000aSo the Centre is promoting the oil-rich jatropha bush, aiming for 11 million hectares by next year, and to increase the area for all biofuel crops by 30%. It says it will only use non-food crops from non-agricultural land, but the Indian environmental research group Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment says jatropha is already taking over farmland.\u000a\u000aThere is reason to worry. Though the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization does not foresee another \u201cconcurrence of so many factors\u201d that caused the food crisis, prices are taking a long time to fall (rice is 100% and maize 50% more than their 2003-06 world averages). Worse, the number of hungry people recently topped one billion\u2014a frightening increase in both the absolute number and the percentage, reversing decades of progress.\u000a\u000aIf biofuel were about the environment, the US would not impose tariffs on environment-friendly ethanol from South America and the Caribbean. Likewise, new EU tariffs are clearly aimed at US producers who send 95% of their biofuel exports to Europe.\u000a\u000aThere is the additional threat that natural habitats will be ploughed up to take advantage of biofuel subsidies. The diversion of existing US cropland to biofuels has shifted soyabean production to South America and Indonesia, encouraging deforestation there.\u000a\u000aPowerful farming lobbies in the US and the EU militate for biofuel subsidies. Like India, both claim a future in \u201csecond-generation\u201d biofuels from plant cellulose or waste, but this nascent industry has yet to deliver value for money.\u000a\u000aCommerce minister Sharma evoked Indira Gandhi\u2019s \u201cpoverty is the biggest polluter\u201d. Indeed, hand-outs to farm and green lobbies will not cut poverty or pollution, nor stop climate change: It is time to end them.\u000a\u000aCaroline Boin is a project director at International Policy Network, a London-based think tank.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aJust before facing a crushing defeat in regional election last Sunday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy had said: \u201cThese are regional elections and their impact need not be national.\u201d But the extent of the defeat he suffered at the hands of the opposition Socialists and their Green and far left allies have forced him to pause and take stock.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Mr. Sarkozy said he was scuttling the Carbon Tax, initially presented by him as an environmental measure with long-term fiscal benefits which placed France at the forefront of countries fighting greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aMany environmentalists had praised it as a bold attempt to intervene in the market and directly alter consumer behaviour to benefit the environment. Emissions by households and business were to be taxed at a rate of \u20ac17 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions. It was set to come into effect on January 1, by imposing direct levies on gasoline, gas and coal use.\u000a\u000aMr. Sarkozy's UMP Party members were unhappy at the proposal which they said would tax French competitiveness, though it was a mainly UMP-dominated Parliament that passed the law in the first place. France is now in the peculiar position of having passed a law and then abolishing the tax that this law created. The President's position can therefore be said to be outside the law.\u000a\u000aMinisters and members of the governing UMP party said the tax would put French companies at a disadvantage compared to their European neighbours, most of whom do not pay anything similar.\u000a\u000aBut analysts said the drubbing handed to the centre-right government on Sunday in the regional elections, brought about the U-turn from Mr. Sarkozy.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister Francois Fillon said the country's environmental policy needed to be \u201cbetter coordinated with the European Union,\u201d particularly so that French companies do not lose ground against their German counterparts.\u000a\u000aOriginally, the carbon tax was supposed to have come into force in January, to raise \u20ac3.5 billion by collecting \u20ac17 per ton of CO2 emitted. Because of the many loopholes for the big industry, France's highest court struck down the legislation as unconstitutional.\u000a\u000aPresident Sarkozy, however, pledged a reworked law by July. In a speech last year, he said no less than the \u201csurvival of the human race\u201d was at stake.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt's a big climb-down linked to the election; it's political,\u201d Nicolas Bouzou, director of Asteres, a financial consultancy in Paris told Reuters. \u201cThere was a lack of preparation and a lot of time and energy was wasted by the government.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said that by arguing that the measure needs to be supported by France's European partners, the government is effectively burying the tax. \u201cThere's no chance that the 27 members of the EU will agree to this,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOther European countries, notably Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and Finland have already implemented carbon taxes, but other countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, would probably be reluctant to go along. Britain and Poland are generally opposed to any tax harmonisation at the European level.\u000a\u000aThe government's latest decision was welcomed by businesses. \u201cWe are relieved,\u201d Laurence Parisot, president of the French employers' federation, Medef, said on Tuesday in a statement, \u201cnotably for all industry which could not bear this extra competitive handicap.\u201d

About 50 lakh people are living in Sunderban Biosphere and Sagar island. There are 70-80 tigers in this area. The bio-diversity, mangrove and people are under threat, he said.\u000a\u000aComprising the largest expanse of mangroves and a unique tiger habitat, Sunderbans is facing a serious threat to its ecosystem from poaching and rampant felling of trees.\u000a\u000aOf the 60 varieties of mangroves and mangrove associates that are found in India, the Sunderbans accounts for 50, many of which are rare.

Conventional wisdom has in the past suggested a trade-off between growth and conservation, with increasing industrialization thought to take a toll on forests. A useful counterpoint to this is the Environmental Kuznets Curve, which shows that conservation initially falls as an economy expands, but revives once a certain growth mark is reached.\u000a\u000aIndia needs to grow steadily for decades to come, as it has done in the past 10 years. There have been concerns that this can compromise its environment. FAO\u2019s findings suggest India may have passed that crucial growth point on the Kuznets Curve.

Ltd, or IOC, will invest around Rs2,000 crore to develop a wind power generation capacity of 200MW and a solar power generation capacity of 50 MW, said a top company official.\u000a\u000a\u201cRenewables will be a major area of focus for us. We are looking at a 10-year horizon,\u201d said IOC chairman B.M. Bansal. \u201cThe reason why we are looking at renewables, petro chemicals or biodiesel is because we do not know for how long the subsidy issue will take to be resolved. Renewable is the way forward.\u201d\u000a\u000aOil-marketing companies such as IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, which operate almost 95% of petrol and diesel retail outlets across the country, are expected to end the current fiscal year with losses of around Rs45,000 crore on account of not being allowed to charge market prices for fuel.\u000a\u000aThe combined losses are seen at around Rs70,000 crore in 2010-11 at current prices.\u000a\u000aIOC registered a net profit of Rs2,950 crore on revenue of Rs2.85 trillion in 2008-09. Between April and December, it had a profit of Rs4,664 crore on a revenue of Rs70,415 crore.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s under recovery for the nine months was Rs7,936 crore, after taking into account upstream discount and oil bonds.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile an investment of Rs1,000 crore will go towards setting up the wind power capacity, another Rs1,000 crore will be for setting up the solar power capacity,\u201d Bansal said.\u000a\u000aIndia has a power generation capacity of 157,000MW, of which 15,427MW is generated through renewable sources. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission aims at achieving 20,000MW of grid solar power and 2,000MW of off-grid solar applications.\u000a\u000aSetting up wind power generation capacity will also help IOC claim tax breaks for up to 10 years and get depreciation benefits of up to 80% on investment in the first year of a project\u2019s operation, besides earning carbon credits.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fuel subsidy issue has discouraged investment into the sector, which has a dampening effect on the national oil companies,\u201d said Gokul Chaudhri, partner at consultancy firm BMR Advisors. \u201cOil companies such as IOC are recalibrating where they will be investing and (are) now looking at sectors which are not regulated in the (same) manner as fuel prices.\u201d\u000a\u000aIOC has been looking at a diversified energy sourcing. The company plans a partnership with Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd (NPCIL) for atomic energy projects at Kakrapar in Gujarat (1,400MW), Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu (2,000MW) and Jaitapur in Maharashtra (3,300MW).

The retreat of Himalayan glaciers and loss in a real extent were monitored in selected basins in J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Sikkim, under a programme on space-based global climate change observation by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\u201cInvestigations on glacial retreat were estimated for 1,317 glaciers in 10 sub-basins from 1962. This has shown an overall reduction in glacial area from 5,866 sqkm to 4,921 sqkm since 1962, showing an overall de-glaciation of 16%\u201d, says the latest annual report of Isro. Snow cover monitoring of all basin has been completed, it said.Atlases for three years are ready and one for the fourth year is being prepared. Modeling response of Himalayan cryosphere to climate change has been initiated, Isro added. Meanwhile, a study on the impact of temperature and carbon dioxide (CO²) rise on the productivity of the four major cereal food crops \u2014 wheat, rice, maize and pearl millet \u2014 revealed that yield of all of them showed reduction with increasing temperature.Assessment after taking field data showed that wheat was the most sensitive crop and maize the least sensitive to temperature rise among the four, Isro pointed out. Another study for climate change impact on hydrology was carried out using \u201cCurve Number\u201d approach to study the change in run off pattern in India at basin level. \u201cAnalysis shows there will be significant increase of run off in the month of June in most of the major river basins\u201d, the 2009-10 report of the Isro said. Isro has also observed a strong correlation between agriculture vegetation (mainly rice areas) and methane concentration.

It is, therefore, imperative that rural poor, especially indigenous people, are made party to the decision-making process and all decisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn India, as per the latest figures, there are about 82 million people who are among themost vulnerable and are known as STs. A Majority of them reside in forested areas and about half of them live below poverty line. They are grouped into 700 tribes. Like in other parts of the world, they are dependent on forest-based natural resources for survival.\u000a\u000aMs. Sangma said the recent global initiatives and measures in the form of REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation Degradation in Developing Countries) were advocated to incentivise efforts for reducing deforestation. \u201cHowever, it has also been argued that this will provide the developed countries an escape route for avoiding responsibilities of reducing emissions. It will merely compensate developing countries to prevent forests from being converted into pasturelands andhas been described as an attempt to lock indigenous people out of their rights over forest land. It may even deprive local communities of their right to land development and distort local economies.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, REDD might just be the weapon the world had been desperately searching for to combat climate change. \u201cFor this, we have advocated that REDD grow into an REDD-plus and also reward efforts for forest conservation and sustainable management of forests.\u201d

In Delhi, chief minister Sheila Dikshit and actor Abhishek Bachchan have publicly declared their support for the campaign.\u000a\u000aInitially conceived of in 2007 in Australia, Earth Hour has now become an annual, global initiative. India first participated last year, when Delhi and Mumbai formally pledged to be involved. This year, along with Delhi and Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata are all participating.\u000a\u000aThe one hour of \u201clights off\u201d does amount to a considerable amount of energy saved--WWF says that one hour saved India 1000MW last year\u2014however, one has to wonder about the event\u2019s significance in the grand scheme of things.\u000a\u000aFor one thing, while the WWF does have several programmes aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change, it does not yet have a sustained grassroots campaign that raises awareness about climate change issues year round. So far it has relied on a one hour, once a year campaign, which has not produced any measurable impact in terms of changing long-term behavior patterns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to say that in one hour on one day we will make a lot of difference,\u201d says Bhavna Mathur, who is working as a Consultant to WWF India on the Earth Hour initiative. \u201cThe main message is that people can do something to address climate change by something as simple as switching off the lights.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile its efforts are laudable, the fact remains that as the world\u2019s leading conservation organization, the WWF should be doing far more to raise awareness about climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe climate change crisis is political in nature but Earth Hour is constructed like a carnival or a festival,\u201d says Pradip Saha, associate director the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment. While Saha acknowledges that any effort towards raising awareness about the crisis is a step in the right direction, he maintains that the outcomes of Earth Hour are not commensurate with the money and effort being poured into the initiative. \u201cBetween last year\u2019s Earth Hour and this year\u2019s Earth Hour I haven\u2019t seen anything,\u201d he says referring to the lack of any sustained awareness about climate change.\u000a\u000aThe hope is that after tomorrow, with Earth Hour 2010 out of the way, the WWF will go about constructing more relevant programmes that have the potential to engage with audiences, change attitudes and influence consumption patterns on a more sustained basis.

The State of the Planet conference organised by the Earth Institute, Columbia University, in New York City and the Delhi Session hosted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) brought insights from the world's most influential and innovative thinkers and leaders from academic disciplines, media, government, policy and business spheresto tackle critical issues facing the world.\u000a\u000aThe Delhi Session had a distinguished panel consisting of Dr Jyoti Parikh, Executive Director Integrated Research and Action for Development (IRADe), member of Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change, Mr Devin Narang, Chairman & Managing Director, Freeplay Energy India Pvt. Ltd., Mr. P Balaji, Vice President - Marketing & Strategy, Ericsson India Pvt.

With regards to technology, Intellectual property (IP) regime is questionable and we need have the spirit of global cooperation and pool in our technologies to work together. Adaptation Fund needs to be linked to emissions, and those emitting more should pay more. We need to go forward with our plans rather than waiting for a global agreement.\u000a\u000aLooking at the current scenario, Dr. Leena Srivastava, said, A global deal cannot happen without having the USA onboard, though we need to start thinking of alternate options if USA continues to maintain the same stand. There is a need to set goals that are driven by self interest considerations like using renewable energy to address the issue of energy security and energy efficiency is recognised as the low hanging fruit by the world. The basis of any international negotiation needs to take into account equity and to some extent historical accountability. We are in agreement with the carbon budgeting approach to look at the carbon space till 2050 to avoid the 2 degrees rise.\u000a\u000aThe panelists from the corporate world emphasised on the need for country-specific technology development and the mainstreaming of renewable energy that need to be conducive for the users. Technology should bridge the rural- urban divide and the focus should be on rural India to reduce migration by providing access to education, health and governance in an effective and cost effective manner through wireless services. Policies should encourage good interaction between the industries for collaborate R&D and technological development.\u000a\u000aThe four major recommendations from India were discussed when the session was connected live to the main event in New York that was moderated by Mr. Simon Cox, South- Asia business correspondent, The Economist:\u000a\u000a-- US, OECD and EU need to do more to move towards a low-carbon economy.\u000a\u000a-- There needs to be a consensus on the baseline year that all need to maintain and follow.\u000a\u000a-- For all the talk of technology transfer, the best technologies are homegrown and tailored to local conditions.\u000a\u000a-- Governments should recognise that ICT is a green technology.\u000a\u000aFor the first time ever, speakers and attendees participated from event sites in New York, Beijing, New Delhi, London and Nairobi. The debates of the day-long event moderated by The Economist journalists in New York and were broadcasted around the world via webcast. Three significant issues facing the world todayclimate change, poverty and economic recovery were discussed. With a range of thought-provoking speakers and thousands participating from around the world, the resulting debates will be truly global in scope.\u000a\u000aThe State of the Planet conference, held every two years, was organised by the Earth Institute, along with The Economist and Ericsson to bring the conversation to the global community. Four major topics placed on the table were: the science and politics of climate change; healing the world economy in an environmentally sustainable way; the ongoing challenge of ending extreme poverty; and how we can build and strengthen international systems able to deal with continuing crises that span borders.\u000a\u000aRenowned figures like UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon; President Felipe Caldern Hinojosa of Mexico; Prince Albert II of Monaco; Sanjeev Chadha, CEO of Pepsico India; Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme; Xu Jintao, head of the environmental economics program, Peking University; and many others.

Starting at 8.30 pm local time, EH will once again traverse the globe and more than 1,200 of the worlds best landmarks will kill their lights, in what the organisers describe as a 24-hour wave of hope and action.\u000a\u000aSince its inception in Sydney in 2007, EHorganised by WWFhas captured the entire worlds imagination and become a global phenomenon. India joined EH in March 2009, with Delhi as its lead city. In India alone, approximately five million people turned off the lights and saved about 1,000 mw power (750 mw in Delhi).\u000a\u000aEH 2010 is hoping to see nearly one billion people participate across 92 countries on all continents. Seventeen new countries and regions are first-time participants. Over 57 capital cities and all G-20 member countries will be making a mark this time. The low-lying state of Tuvalu, which is threatened by rising sea levels, will be pulling out the plug for the entire nation. In India, the initiative has gathered a lot of attention with over a million people signing up on the Web site to pledge support. A raft of MNCs like Google, Coca-Cola, Infosys, McDonalds, Canon and HSBC have endorsed EH 2010 and pledged their support. Public institutions like BSES and NDPL have also promised to extend support.\u000a\u000aEH has its critics. Sceptics say that an hour-long blackout is not enough to turn the tide on climate-changing carbon emissions. There even exists a group called Human Achievement Hour that was started in opposition to EH. It encourages participants to celebrate this hourwhich coincides with EHby turning on all their lights and using as much electricity as possible to celebrate the fact that they can. But climate change is a political issue and symbols are important to the language of politics. So, critics need to understand that the purpose of EH is to let world leaders know that people support mitigation efforts. Folks participating in EH proclaim that they care about what happens at big global jamborees like Copenhagen 2009 or Mexico City 2010.\u000a\u000ajaya.jumrani@expressindia.com

a((VNEW DELHI: In the first international meet of the year on climate change in Mexico , the battlelines were again drawn as US tried to push for a small coterie of countries to lead the talks but developing countries, including India, opposed diluting the primacy of the formal talks under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The meeting was called by Mexico, which will become the official chair of the UN talks and take over from Denmark in December.Against the backdrop of gloom over securing any concrete and comprehensive deal by December, Mexico has been trying hard to find a middle ground between the developed and developing countries in order to achieve even a partial success when its hosts the meeting.But at this meet, India and other developing countries opposed any creation of informal groups that did not have the explicit sanction of the UN climate convention members \u2014 the way it had happened in the controversial meeting in December last year at Copenhagen.There was consensus that the fast-track funds promised for adaptation to poor and vulnerable countries should be hastened despite ongoing debates on other issues but this too got stuck with the US insisting that it was not ready to cough up more money than its current commitments for forestry to the tune of $3.5 billion. The developing countries were insistent at Mexico that the informal meetings and groupings have the formal sanction of the countries through the UN process.While India and other countries did not outright reject informal meets, they along with host Mexico insisted that all decisions should finally be routed through the UN process.While the US attempted to give a higher priority to the Copenhagen Accord, India and others insisted that all documents that were taken on board at the Copenhagen meet \u2014 formal UN texts as well as the Copenhagen Accord \u2014 be used as the basis for further talks under the formal process.

a((VNEW Delhi: As cities world over switch off lights for one hour tomorrow in an attempt to create more awareness about climate change, the WWF exuded optimism about Earth Hour 2010 initiative in India saving more energy than last year."Of all sectors, the power sector solely contributes a whopping 50 per cent to India's total carbon emission. Under the Earth Hour initiative people are motivated to switch off their lights and electrical appliances from 8.30 pm to 9.30 pm on March 27.This is a measure to instill awareness about depleting climatic conditions on Earth," says Aarti Khosla, Campaign Manager, World Wide Fund India.Last year, the organisation was able to encourage saving of around 1200 mega watts of energy in India, "but this year we definitely plan to surpass this," points out Khosla.Growing environmental threats - most recent devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile - have rung alarm for natural resource conservation at all levels.United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called Earth Hour "both a warning and a beacon of hope.""Climate change is a concern for each of us. Solutions are within our grasp and are ready to be implemented by individuals, communities, businesses and governments around the globe," Ban said in a statement.The United Nations will be joining will join the initiative along with many other landmarks around the world.However, several other groups in India have also shown a keen interest on the occasion in creating awareness in the masses regarding the dire need to preserve natural resources."Climate change is a discrepancy created by persistent human exploitation. Hence, its cure lies only in a consistent and united human initiative...individual awareness and action is the key to combat climate change," says Aditi Mehndiratta, head 'Sanrakshan', nature conservation initiative of an NGO."The NGO has inspired lakhs of beneficiaries not only in India but across the globe to switch all their lights and electrical appliances. Along with this our followers would also sit in divine meditation on Earth Hour and pray for the strength of Mother Earth," adds Mehndiratta.At the British Council High Commission in India, environmental films will be screened a day prior to the Earth Hour. "A film screening and photo exhibition is being organised in order to sensitise our staff and their family about the depleting state of environment. Apart from this, office lighting would be turned off from 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm," says Dan Chugg, spokesperson of the Commission in India.

Shaun Curry/ AFP\u000a\u000aUpdated: Fri, Mar 26 2010. 08 47 PM IST\u000a\u000aNobuo Tanaka is a man short on time. International Energy Agency, or IEA, apart from being the world\u2019s premier energy monitor, also plays an important role in climate change policies, market reform and energy technology collaboration. Tanaka was recently in New Delhi to participate in the 6th Asia Gas Partnership Summit where he spoke to Mint on issues as varied as Indian government\u2019s attempts to address the issue of subsidy burden, crude oil prices, US interventions in energy-rich countries and the growing competition between India and China for energy resources. Edited excerpts: Price signal: Tanaka says that if the economic recovery is robust as it should be, crude prices will rise. Shaun Curry/ AFP New Delhi: As the energy policy adviser to 28 member countries,is a man short on time. International Energy Agency, or IEA, apart from being the world\u2019s premier energy monitor, also plays an important role in climate change policies, market reform and energy technology collaboration. Tanaka was recently in New Delhi to participate in the 6th Asia Gas Partnership Summit where he spoke toon issues as varied as Indian government\u2019s attempts to address the issue of subsidy burden, crude oil prices, US interventions in energy-rich countries and the growing competition between India and China for energy resources. Edited excerpts:\u000a\u000aIndia has been talking about reforms in the energy sector for some time now. The intent is to bring down the subsidy burden as they are unsustainable over a long term. What are your views?\u000a\u000aYes, that\u2019s right. When the price of oil is high at certain reference price, it increases the fiscal burden for the government. So in the long term, due to cost of exploration and development, the cost of oil will get higher... So subsidies will be very difficult to sustain. We have been asked by the G-20 (Group of Twenty) countries to make some analysis of subsidies. We are going to report to the G-20 finance ministers meeting which is next month on 23 April in Washington, DC.\u000a\u000aWe did a similar study in 2007. The total amount then was $320 billion (around Rs14.5 trillion today) globally. Since in 2008 the oil prices were very high, the subsidies should have been much higher, that\u2019s what we guess.\u000a\u000aSo for India, we are strongly advising to phase out price control and subsidy as it is very important to make price signal from the market directly to the consumer. That is the way to conserve energy or move to an energy-efficient society or economy. We understand that the Indian government is serious about phasing out subsidies and trying their best. It is also politically very difficult, we understand that. In many countries, it is mandatory for the governments to help and to support the poor population. Our advice is\u2014yes, it is necessary to support the poor but don\u2019t undermine the energy sector, because subsidy is wasteful use of energy sources and also adds to the problem of low investment in infrastructure. It (subsidy) prohibits infrastructure investment. So this is not good. In the longer term, I think this (Indian) government is committed to phasing out subsidy but in practical terms it will certainly take some time.\u000a\u000aSo when this report is ready, would G-20 as a group ask India to take care of the subsidy burden?\u000a\u000aG-20 is asking the Indian government to make sure that the phasing out of subsidy happens. We do not have the power to really enforce this phase out. I think that this government clearly understands the necessity and is moving in the direction towards it. Our study tries to help the governments to move in the right direction.\u000a\u000aThere is still a considerable percentage of population in India which does not have access to energy. How do you see India\u2019s energy demands growing?\u000a\u000aThat is the point. In China and India, the per capita energy consumption is very low compared to the global average and much more growth is necessary to reach there. On the other hand, if India or China go through the same way as the former developed countries, I mean the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, then the fossil fuel consumption will go so high that the price of oil and price of gas will climb rapidly. World CO2 emissions will increase so much that it will not be sustainable. So the only solution for this economic growth and the CO2 emission is more energy-efficient society, more greener systems of living, using electric vehicles and more efficient housing. So this kind of revolutionary change in lower carbon technology is necessary. We are working with the Indian government on what kind of technology does India need to make this revolutionary change.\u000a\u000aIs $100 per barrel of crude the realistic price?\u000a\u000aWe are not commenting on the level of price. It is always moving. About four-five years ago, $30 per barrel price was seen as a very high price. Now $100 may be a high price but we have seen crude oil prices reaching $147 per barrel, so what is the high price, we can\u2019t tell. In the mid to long term, we know that the cost of investment in exploration, development and production will increase. We will have much more deeper offshore oil fields or oil sands so the cost will increase. Because of the supply-demand situation, the market is tighter, and if the economic recovery is robust as it should be, the prices will get higher.\u000a\u000aGiven the way that the crude demand has picked up, is the world out of the recession?\u000a\u000aThat is a good question. I think India, China and Middle East are out of recession, but not necessarily the OECD countries because OECD countries demand is projected to be negative in 2010. The OECD demand will shrink in 2010. On the other hand, macro economists say that OECD countries are on the track of economic recovery. So we call it oil less recovery. In other emerging economies, we see economic recovery happening and the demand for oil is coming back.\u000a\u000aWhen do you see a recovery in OECD demand?\u000a\u000aThat is a difficult question because the current price levels and current financial troubles in Europe may have a very negative impact.\u000a\u000aIs there a way around for energy firms across the globe which want to invest in Iran, Sudan and other countries where the US has imposed sanctions?\u000a\u000aThis is a very difficult judgement an investor should make because they risk their business chance in the United States if they don\u2019t abide by the sanctions. On the other hand, we want stabilization of the place and as much investment to happen, for decline of the current production level from the existing oil fields is a serious concern. We need a huge investment just to offset this decline.\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t the US policing these resources now? For example, Indian firms have done well in Sudan. It seems that when the US companies can\u2019t get through they impose sanctions, which will also make sure that no one goes there and those resources are well covered for the US?\u000a\u000a(Laughs). Well, if Indian companies take some risk and go there and explore and develop, certainly it helps the global market in the demand and supply situation.\u000a\u000aSo as an organization would you be interested in promoting investments in countries such as Iran or Sudan?\u000a\u000aWe are not promoting that. Certainly in terms of the global markets, difficult places, not only these geopolitically difficult places, but also in places like the Arctic, very deep offshore, nobody dares to take the risk. If that\u2019s the case, then we have a serious problem. Taking risk is part of the business. The ways of taking risks are different, depending on the way of a country or the way of a corporation.\u000a\u000aGiven the fact that the demand will come from China and India with the demand slowing down in the West, the two countries are in a quest for securing energy resources overseas. In the process, it inflates the acquisition cost of an asset. What is the way forward?\u000a\u000aYes, to some extent it depends upon how companies from India and China do business. It is obvious that due to high prices you suffer... If you suffer, you change the way of making a deal, consulting more closely with other consuming countries, companies and make a consortium. This is the process.\u000a\u000aSo the way forward is to collaborate?\u000a\u000aExactly, for example, we always ask the European countries to speak in one voice to the supplier. By doing so you have a huge advantage in negotiations.\u000a\u000autpal.b@livemint.com

France is a leading member of the EU.Environment Jairam Ramesh is reported to have said that India would contest any move to impose carbon tax by EU at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).Ramesh has said that barriers like anti-emission tax would not be compatible with the WTO rules."There is a reflection on the possibility for Europe to have carbon tax for countries which will not commit themselves to fighting climate change. It means... who are not cooperating in...implementing the UN Convention on Climate Change and the protocols," he told reporters.India exports merchandise worth around $40 billion to the 27-nation bloc, mostly garments, machines, chemicals, leather goods and handicraft.

a((VThe writer is professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi.\u000a\u000aSource: the Foresight Initiative.\u000a\u000aWater, food, energy and minerals are highly strategic resources. They are essential to human development and, in the case of water and food, to human survival. Food production is, meanwhile, closely intertwined with water and energy, while water and energy, for their part, are intimately linked to climate change. While the way we produce and consume energy makes up about two-thirds of all human-induced greenhouse gases , the availability of water resources will be directly affected by global warming.Growing populations, rising affluence, changing diets and the demands of development have already, however, placed significant pressure upon these strategic resources. The global food system is already struggling to meet the present demand for food, yet the World Bank projects a rise of 50 per cent in global demand for food by 2030. To grow more food will require more water - a resource now also under great strain, as pollution is threatening the world's freshwater resources.The 2030 Water Resources Group , a consortium of private-social sector organisations, has pointed to a growing "water gap" in which global demand for water will be 40 per cent more than supply by 2030. Today, agriculture alone accounts for approximately 3,100 billion cubic metres or 71 per cent of global water withdrawals; by 2030, without water-efficiency gains, such withdrawals will increase to 4,500 billion m3. Water withdrawals by industry are projected to rise from 16 per cent of today's global demand to 22 per cent in 2030, with the greatest growth in use coming from China, the world's factory.As for energy, the imperative to combat global warming goes against the current trends of rising consumption of energy, much of it produced with fossil fuel. Such is Asia's appetite for energy that its share of global consumption is projected to almost double over the next 20 years - to about 48 per cent for oil and 22 per cent for natural gas. Yet, given its limited oil and gas reserves, Asia is particularly vulnerable to sudden supply shortage or disruption.A further aspect regarding competition over resources is the intensification of resource geopolitics. Europe, for example, has worked hard to shape the direction of some of the Caspian Basin and Central Asian oil and gas pipelines because it has a stake in the issue of the routing. If Central Asian and Caspian Sea energy supplies are routed to the European market, that would help Europe diversify its imports and ease its dependence on Russia.Within Asia, China has emerged as a key player in pipeline politics. Beijing has built its own pipeline to bring oil from Kazakhstan and is seeking two gas pipelines from Russia. These pipelines are a lynchpin of China's strategy to diversify its imports away from over-reliance on the volatile Persian Gulf region, the current source of more than half of Chinese overseas purchases. In contrast, energy-poor India and Japan do not have a similar option. Lacking geographical contiguity with Central Asia and Iran, India will remain largely dependent on oil imports by sea from the Persian Gulf region.China, with the world's most resource-hungry economy, fears that in the event of a strategic confrontation, its economy could be held hostage by hostile naval forces through the interdiction of its oil imports. That same concern has prompted Beijing to build a strategic oil reserve, and China is now seeking to fashion two strategic corridors in southern Asia through which it could transfer Persian Gulf and African oil for its consumption by cutting the transportation distance and minimising its exposure to US-policed sea lanes.The new Chinese-built port at Gwadar, Pakistan, represents China's first strategic foothold in the Arabian Sea. Gwadar, at the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, will link up with the Trans-Karakoram corridor to western China. China is also establishing a similar energy corridor through Myanmar.The blunt and incontrovertible truth is that energy demands in Asia are beginning to influence strategic thinking and military planning. For some states, a rising dependence on oil imports has served to rationalise both a growing emphasis on maritime power and security as well as a desire to seek greater strategic space. Concerns over sealane safety and rising vulnerability to disruption of energy supplies are prompting some countries to explore avenues for joint cooperation in maritime security.Water presents a unique challenge. While countries can scour the world for oil, natural gas and minerals to keep their economic machines humming, water cannot be secured through international trade deals. Sustainable and integrated management of national water resources is essential to prevent degradation, depletion and pollution of water. To meet the gap between supply and demand, water conservation, water efficiency, rainwater capture, water recycling and drip irrigation would have to be embraced at national, provincial and local levels.One can hope that advances in clean-water technologies would materialise before water conflicts flare. Low-cost, energy-efficient technologies for treating and recycling water could emerge from the scientific progress on nanoparticles and nanofibres and membrane bioreactors.

a((VNEW DELHI: In a fillip to Delhi Government 's plan to switch from coal to environment-friendly gas at Badarpur power station , a Central panel has given its nod to the pre-construction activities. Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) under the Environment Ministry, at a recent meeting, has issued the terms of reference (ToR) to the project proponent, NTPC, asking it to prepare a detailed environment impact assessment (EIA) report and the environment management plan for the project.EIA is a study of human activities that can be sustained without any adverse impact on the environment and has to be mandatorily prepared by a project proponent before it could seek environment clearance.The Petroleum Ministry has already agreed to provide 7.10 million cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of natural gas to the 705 mega watt (mw) power coal plant in south Delhi for generating additional 1050 mw to meet the power needs of the city, a Delhi Government official said.Switching over to gas-based plants is part of the state government's move to cut down air pollution levels in the city and also to tackle climate change threat.The EAC has sought detailed socio-economic study, an action plan for identification of local employable youth for training in skills relevant to it as well as a layout plan indicating break-up of plant, green belt, infrastructure, roads and others as TOR to get the final approval, the official said.The EAC has also asked NTPC to get clearance from Central Pollution Control Board to ensure that it does not fall in the critically polluted clusters/ industrial areas identified by it.The Delhi government has set 2012 as target date for switching over the Badarpur power plant to gas to add to its list of already two gas-run units of Pragati Power, which produce 330 mw.Presently the three coal-based power stations are the 705 mw Badarpur power plant, the 150 mw Rajghat power plant and the 100 mw Indraprastha power station.

a((VNoting that the implementation of the landmark India-US civil nuclear deal presented a "win-win situation", India has sought more trade in high technology items with the removal of Indian firms from the barred Entity list.\u000a\u000a"Once the 123 Agreement is implemented, a structured bilateral interaction with the Industry on both sides could take forward the process," Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said Monday at the opening industry-to-industry session of the India-US High Technology Cooperation Group (HTCG).\u000a\u000aSimilarly, the India US Bilateral Investment Treaty, which is presently under discussion, as also India's defence procurement programme presented opportunities, she told the session whose discussions would inform the bilateral official dialogue of the group Tuesday.\u000a\u000aRao and Dennis F. Hightower, US Deputy Secretary of Commerce are co-chairing the seventh meeting of the HTCG, its first since President Barack Obama took office. The HTCG was conceived in November 2001 to facilitate high-technology commerce between the two countries.\u000a\u000aThe business-to-business session, convened by the US-India Business Council\u000a\u000a(USIBC) in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), has been tasked to suggest ways to facilitate trade in defence/strategic trade, civil nuclear cooperation, biotechnology, nano-technology and civil aviation\u000a\u000aWelcoming, the US announcement of its intention to overhaul the US Export Control policy, Rao said India has shared its views regarding US high technology restrictions applicable to India with the US Department of Commerce.\u000a\u000a"We see this as yet another area where Indian and US interest converge and, as a reliable and strategic partner, we look forward to seeing enhancement of trade in such goods and technologies between our two countries and removal of remaining Indian organizations from the Entity List," she said.\u000a\u000a"It is anomalous that a body like ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), which is developing several collaborations with (US space agency) NASA, should continue to be on this list," Rao pointed out.\u000a\u000aHoping that the business session's review would "reflect and reaffirm the strategic nature of our partnership," she said: "Ideally, the collaborations in this forum should spawn a multitude of India-US partners across the hemispheres."\u000a\u000aRao suggested partnerships in such areas as working jointly to address the impact of climate change or in tandem on technology collaborations and commercialisation of new technologies from the laboratory to the market.\u000a\u000aCiting authoritative studies indicating that by 2020, India and US will probably be two of the three largest economies in the world, she said: "Our partnership will undoubtedly benefit both the Indian as well as the US industry through the many synergies that we will create."\u000a\u000a"The total exports of Advanced Technology Products from the United States to India has increased from $1.3 billion in 2003 to over $4 billion in 2009, a somewhat impressive increase, particularly against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown," she noted.\u000a\u000aAs the US Government undertakes a thorough export control review to increase high technology exports, "I would say, there could be no better partner than India to galvanize hi-tech US exports," Rao said.\u000a\u000a

a((VCancun is in news again. Seven years ago, this coastal city in eastern Mexico was the venue for the 5th ministerial meeting of the WTO. In a few weeks time, from November 29, the city will be hosting the next United Nations Conference on Climate Change.\u000a\u000aThe similarity in backdrops between the two occasions is striking. The WTO ministerial in 2003 followed the earlier ministerial in Doha in 2001. The Doha ministerial had adopted the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) that attempted to make developing countries bigger players in global trade. World trade dynamics were never the same again with the North-South divide surfacing sharply on several issues leading to almost negligible progress on the agenda. The Cancun ministerial brought out the divide in world trade in the open with daggers sharply drawn. Though one does not know the fate awaiting Cancun this time, like in 2003, it is convening after a tumultuous and landmark summit on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009.\u000a\u000aThe latest summit on climate is also expected to see the North and South clashing on several issues, particularly quantum of emission cuts. Developing countries have taken most by surprise by implementing programmes of large-scale cuts in emission volumes. China led the efforts followed by Brazil, India and Indonesia. On the other hand, major developed country emittersthe US, Canada, Australia, for exampleare yet to announce similar targets.\u000a\u000aMajor emerging market countries are expected to criticise their developed counterparts at the forthcoming summit for lack of action. Chinas role in this regard has been similar to what it has been playing at the WTO. Chinas annexation to the WTO was announced at the Doha ministerial in November 2001. Its entry was accompanied by unprecedented commitments to cutting tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The particularly noticeable commitments were the deep cuts in agricultural tariffs and the transitional safeguards to other developing countries for responding to sudden spurts in Chinese exports. By the time the action shifted to Cancun, agricultural tariffs in China were nearly half of such tariffs in other emerging markets and developed countries. China has frequently cited its extensive commitments to deeper market access as example of its lasting commitment to the multilateral trade system. This has been the plank on which it has been criticising lack of movement by developed countries in reducing subsidies and domestic support on agricultural exports. In a similar vein, by announcing unconditional commitments to emission cuts, it has put developing countries on a wrong foot with regard to the action agenda on climate change. There will be considerable pressure on high emission developed countries at Cancun, particularly the US, to spell out an action plan.\u000a\u000aChina has utilised the changing balance in global economic power for pushing a proactive position on climate change. Developing countries have been pressing for financial assistance for fulfilling emission cut targets. Chinas unconditional move is a reflection of its confidence to go ahead without financial support. On the other hand, the US and Europe will find it hard to contribute generously to the public fund that is expected to help developing countries in mitigating emission targets. Surplus resources with developed countries after the financial crisis are hardly much to ensure sincere commitments in this regard.\u000a\u000aChina, India, Brazil and South Africa (BASIC) are a powerful coalition of emerging market economies that is expected to take on developed countries at Cancun on the future roadmap for addressing climate change. The BASIC inevitably refreshes memories of the G20 coalition on agriculture at WTO. The four BASIC members were part of the G20 group of developing countries that took on the US and EU on market access proposals on agriculture in the WTO ministerial at Cancun in 2003. The aggressive posture of the G20 on subsidies and special and differential (S&D) treatment for developing countries led to collapse of talks on the DDA. This time, two months before the climate meeting at Cancun, the BASIC met at Tianjin in China for developing a common strategy for the forthcoming summit. The BASIC has decided to urge developed countries to commit to ambitious reduction targets and contribute handsomely to a new public fund for meeting mitigation costs. They have also urged developed countries to fulfil commitments on technology transfers and not deviate from the same on climate grounds.\u000a\u000aThe underlying circumstances and build-up to Cancunseven years laterare too similar in terms of the North-South dynamics to be treated as purely coincidental. Will the outcome be the same as well\u000a\u000aThe author is visiting senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies in the National University of Singapore.

a((VNEW DELHI: PM Manmohan Singh will on Monday inaugurate Petrotech 2010, India's biennial jamboree for the global oil industry, being billed as the first carbon-neutral event in the country that will bring together over 4,000 professionals from related sectors on a single platform for finding global equilibrium and greening of an industry often seen as a major contributor to pollution.The event, being organised by ONGC under the aegis of the oil ministry, has been mapped for carbon emission by Deloitte and will be written off by the state-run explorer. This entails minimising use of paper, going for group transportation solutions using CNG, an omnibus resource website, minimum travel in organising the event and redesign of the sponsorship package from the print medium to the visual and electronic medium.It is also for the first time that Petrotech is focusing in a big way on CSR (corporate social responsibility) and is a no-bags conference. Six school bags are being distributed to children from underprivileged sections of society for every bag that was supposed to have been given to delegates. Each delegate still gets a customised gift pack manufactured by Tribes India, an institution focused on improving the livelihood of tribal craftspersons.The exhibition, being held as part of the event, too is a green event. Material such as recycled wood, carpets made of recycled material and CFL or LED bulbs for lighting that consume minimum energy and leave minimum carbon footprints are being used. As a mark of India's growing importance in the oil market, Russia, Malaysia, Canada, China, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Holland, Denmark, UAE and Indonesia are among 200 international exhibitors and participants who occupy some 7,700 sq metres of space.A `Training for Teachers' Centre is also being set up with an investment of Rs 25 lakh. It will train teachers who will then impart education to children in remote and inaccessible locations. Around 4,000 delegates, speakers and exhibitors are expected to attend the conference and deliberate on how the global energy markets operate through three major panel discussions.

a((VAdvertising Standards Authority (ASA) of UK has ruled that a Oxfam poster stating that people are dying because of climate change 'was not misleading', dismissing complaints that the assertion could not be proven. ASA had received four complaints saying that the statement linking people dying due climate change was misleading and could not be substantiated.\u000a\u000aThe charitys poster ad campaign which said: "People dying thanks to climate change is a long way off. About 5,000 miles, give or take ... Our politicians have the power to help get a climate deal back on track."\u000a\u000aOxfam claimed that a number of reputable organisations, including the World Health Organisation, had published research proving this was true.\u000a\u000aThe ASA investigated the claim, and agreed that there was "robust consensus" that there was "extremely strong evidence for human-induced climate change".\u000a\u000a"We noted that Oxfam's claim was reasonably restrained in that it stated deaths were occurring at the present time as a result of climate change but that it did not claim specific numbers of deaths were attributable and it did not speculate about future numbers of deaths," added the UK watchdog.\u000a\u000aOxfam said it hoped the ASAs ruling would make people understand that climate change was having a real impact across the world.\u000a\u000aMartin Sorrell: We're back to LUV-shaped recovery\u000a\u000aWPP chief executive officers Sir Martin Sorrell has said that an "LUV"-shaped recovery is expected for 2011 as different countries continued to recover at different speeds. He also said that the advertising group's growth was at its strongest for 10 years.\u000a\u000a"LUV" shaped recovery describes a complex global picture: L-shaped in western Europe, U-shaped in the US and V-shaped in the so-called Bric nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China.\u000a\u000aWe might see a rebalancing next year I think next year is more likely to be LUV-shaped," he said speaking at a conference in Berlin. "The world is operating at different speeds there is no doubt about that. There are three levels of growth: the Brics at the top, the US and Germany in the middle and slow growth western Europe, which includes the UK, at the bottom."\u000a\u000aNew creative effectiveness category at Cannes Lions\u000a\u000aThe Cannes International Advertising Festival will add an effectiveness category next year. The festival organizers said in a statement that the new award, to be called Cannes Creative Effectiveness Lions, will honour creativity "which has shown a measurable and proven impact on a client's business -- creativity that effects consumer behavior, brand equity, sales and, where identifiable, profit." Only work that was shortlisted or a Lion winner at this year's festival is eligible to compete for an effectiveness award in 2011. This year the festival shortlisted about 2,325 entries, or about 10% of the total work entered. The festival said that the criteria for the new award will be results, accounting for 50% of an entry's score, along with strategy (25%) and idea (25%). The festival cautioned that the data in all entries will be checked by the external auditors at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u000a\u000aUK leads the world in online shopping\u000a\u000aIf you thought the US was the biggest online shopping market, think again. It is UK with its 100 billion internet economy that leads the world in online shopping.\u000a\u000aUK's e-commerce sectors per-capita online spending is higher than even the US, according to The Connected Kingdom, a report commissioned by Google and carried out by Boston Consulting Group.\u000a\u000aIt also has the second largest online advertising market in the world after the US, according to consultancy Bain. The internet contributed some 100 billion, or 7.2%, to gross domestic product in 2009.\u000a\u000aPaul Zwillenberg, a partner at BCG said: "Everyone thinks the global Silicon-Valley-based companies are driving growth, but this report makes clear that in the UK it is coming from the 'mom and pop' businesses.\u000a\u000aThey now have global footprints, they are selling to the 'long tail' and they are making their businesses more efficient."

a((VLast year\u2019s Copenhagen summit on climate change ended on a note of differences between developed and developing nations on several key issues related to climate change and emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, it\u2019s time for yet another World Climate Conference, this time at Cancun, Mexico (November 29 to December 10). Speaking to Deccan Herald, Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, the Chairperson of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the director general of TERI explains, \u201cThe talks should be steered by the science part of it and not by political motives. It\u2019s a political negotiation, but one has to understand the overall concern for every living species which will be affected by the impact of climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAfter the controversial IPCC report on Himalayan glaciers in 2007 and the subsequent retractions, Pachauri lists out what the 2014 report will have.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are many new features in the report like cloud cover, black carbon, geo-engineering options, the ethical and equity dimensions of the efforts that are being taken in respect of mitigation of the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPachauri added that this would include an \u201cupdating of all the other elements of science because new knowledge is emerging and we are going to take that on board. We hope that we can look at regional details to a much greater extent than in the past.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe have selected 831 authors and review editors out of about 3000 nominations that we received which shows that the scientific community is very enthusiastic about working for the IPCC.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGeo-engineering\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat about geo-engineering which finds a mention in the 2014 report? He said, \u201cWe will assess its economic feasibility, its scientific and technical effectiveness and other implications in terms of ecosystems and sustainability. It would be quite pre-mature to form an opinion at this point of time but we are going to assess all the literature that is developing in this field and then come up with clear suggestions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe IPCC chief who was in Bangalore to attend a programme on sustainable development of infrastructure in Karnataka stressed the importance of looking \u201ctwenty years into the future to devise transport plans which would resolve the present bottlenecks in a city like Bangalore.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis would require laying down some incentives and some dis-incentives, some regulatory measures to be adopted not only at state level but also at the local level. We would have to ensure that we create capacities, which means training people at various levels.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to energy needs and rural areas, Pachauri points out that TERI\u2019s lighting a billion lights programme can take care of the large number of people who live without lights and access to electricity. He added that, \u201cwe are focusing on solar technology and would like to create entrepreneurship at the rural level. It can create clean sustainable lighting in all homes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHopeful about solar technology\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPachauri is hopeful about the use of solar technology even in cloudy and rainy pockets in rural areas. \u201cThe number of hours of lighting might reduce, but it is still better than not having a light. We have also talked about large scale renewable energy. There are enormous opportunities which are also land intensive in connection with Karnataka.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn places where not a blade of grass grows, there are possibilities of very high insulation of solar energy. It is an opportunity to be explored. In the next four-five years the need for energy in the state will be about 7000 megawatts. For this need there is a requirement of fossil fuel. The other option is to go in for 2000-3000 megawatts of capacity through solar technology. The gestation period is not so long.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe believes that the right kind of technological innovation and enough manufacturing capacity is needed for implementing the most advanced form of technology for lighting households.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPachauri appreciated the government\u2019s effort to bring in CFL bulbs at a subsidised rates but cautioned about its disposal process keeping in mind the harmful mercury content in these bulbs. He said, it might take four to five years from now to make LED bulbs available in the local markets, but till then CFL can reduce energy consumption to a large extent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn curbing emissions\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat about the role of India in curbing emissions? Pachauri points out that India is a country of well over a billion people and there is a huge disparity of income and growth in this country where resources are finite. He said, \u201cWe are becoming a major exporter of hydrocarbons that has serious implications, so I think India has to work on substitutes for fossil fuels, sooner the better.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt would also be of enormous commercial relevance because now the world is moving in that direction. So I think for a host of domestic and national reasons, India has to pursue a path of sustainable development. In doing so we would certainly be a much lower emitting nation even on per capita basis than other countries of the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThat would be our strength not a weakness and an advantage.\u201dHe agreed that traditional ethnic communities have been coping with climate change in the remotest parts of the world. He said, \u201cI think whatever resilience we build in relation to scientific pursuits has to be in addition to whatever we already have as the knowledge base evident within these communities. It is important that we understand this fact and keep focus on the rich traditional knowledge which already exists.\u201d

So by no means can China and India be equated in the level of greenhouse gas emissions," Ramesh said at a seminar on India-China relations organised in New Delhi by Communist Party of China and Congress party.\u000a\u000a"Even though the levels of emissions are just not different but are dramatically different... we certainly have a commanality of interest in ensuring that there is no international agreement that puts an artificial barrier on our growth prospects," he said.\u000a\u000aChina is the world's leading emittor accounting for about 22% of the world's carbon emissions followed by US (21%), the EU (13%) and India at about 5%.\u000a\u000aIndia and China have been strongly opposing the developed nations' move to impose a tax on countries that fail to abide by a binding climate treaty as the two major growing economies will have to take emission control measures.\u000a\u000aHowever, Ramesh asserted that even under the most aggressive growth estimates over the next ten years, India's share in the GHG emissions will not exceed more than 8-9% by 2020.\u000a\u000a"So we are not in the same league as far as emissions are concerned. Both the countries (India and China) have relatively low per capita incomes but nevertheless the most important common thread is that neither of the two would like an international agreement to put a barrier on future economic growth prospects," the minister maintained.\u000a\u000aHe sought to make it clear that despite the insistence of developed nations, there was no question of taking binding carbon emission cuts, a position that India and China along with other Basic members such as Brazil and South Africa maintained at the UN summit on climate change at Copenhagen in Denmark last year.\u000a\u000aRamesh said that within the Basic group, climate change was the immmediate provocation for India and China to build a very close relationship in coordinating our international position.\u000a\u000a"But there are certain other areas as well where we have taken cooperation forward," Ramesh said of various steps taken in the last one year in the field of forestary, environment pollution and wildlife conservation.\u000a\u000a"We are now looking at collaboration in the area of clean technology such as renewable energy," the minister added.

Ahead of the Cancun meet,it will host ‘informal’ talks between ministers from 48 nations to build a consensus on the contentious global mechanism for transfer of environmentally-sound technologies and matching funds to countries that would be most hit by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC).\u000a\u000aThe Ministerial Dialogue would focus on ‘concrete questions’ to promote understanding and work towards consensus building on establishing an International Technology Mechanism and a Financial Mechanism to cover the extra costs that developing countries would suffer on switching to expensive but climate-friendly technologies being pushed under the UNFCC.\u000a\u000a“The goal of the roundtable is to enable ministers to assess the options from a practical and operational perspective,and channel political guidance into areas where it would be most strategic with a view to facilitate agreement at COP 16 (16th Conference of Parties) in Cancun,” says the concept note for the meet.\u000a\u000aThe two-day conference,which starts the day Obama leaves India,would address issues on means of implementation,including institutional framework,capacity building,innovation,commercialisation,financing,mainstreaming and partnerships to facilitate development,transfer,diffusion and deployment of technologies.\u000a\u000aLast year,India played host to an international conference on Technology Development and Transfer,which resulted in Delhi Statement on Global Cooperation on Climate Technology that proved to be a useful input in the negotiations at the Copenhagen conference.\u000a\u000aThough a decision on this aspect could not be arrived at the Copenhagen meet,the need to actualise this mechanism acquires significance in the run-up to the Cancun climate talks next month.\u000a\u000aThe Cancun talks are aimed at reaching agreed outcomes on the Bali Action Plan under which nations have to evolve necessary mechanisms that enable and provide support to developing countries in terms of technologies.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries need environment-friendly technology and affiliated funds to achieve sustainable development while combating climate change. But these transfers are getting stalemated because of barriers in developed countries and lack of offsetting policies,capacity development and financial resources.\u000a\u000aThe dialogue,which is being promoted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,will be organised in cooperation with the UN Department of Economic & Social Affairs and the Government of Mexico which holds the presidency of COP 16.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

The climate financing would increase from $30 billion to $100 billion by 2020.\u000a\u000aThe findings by the High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Finance headed by Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Zenawi proposed various ways to allow governments and the private sector to work together to raise the huge amount by 2020.\u000a\u000aMs. Hedegaard pointed out that the study\u2019s new and innovative sources of revenue crucially depend on the future carbon price and the proportion of emission allowances that is auctioned.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn this context, the European Commission reiterates that at least half of the revenues from the auctioning of EU emission allowances should be used to finance climate action, including in developing countries,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Prime Ministers gave the study to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the United Nations headquarters in New York as part of U.N. preparations for a new round of climate negotiations scheduled to take place next month in Cancun, Mexico.\u000a\u000aMr. Ban said the study contained \u201cfinancing options that are both financially feasible and politically viable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will need sustained political will, appropriate public policy signals for the markets and financial ingenuity,\u201d Mr. Ban said in response to the study.\u000a\u000aHe called on all countries to demonstrate a strong commitment to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aMr. Ban also urged the G20 summit in Seoul next week to discuss climate change directly.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAn 80-nation conference on food security urged U.N. climate negotiators on Friday to consider agriculture when drawing up strategies to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aThe five-day meeting ended with a call to invest in new farming practices that will curb greenhouse gas emissions and will better use currently available land to feed a global population of 9 billion by 2050.\u000a\u000aAbout 30 per cent of carbon emissions come from farming, livestock and forest destruction.\u000a\u000aDespite its huge share of global emissions, accounting for the use of land is one of the toughest issues under negotiation at U.N. climate talks, and the one which has made the least progress.\u000a\u000aThe talks involve creating incentives for emission reductions by vast agricultural conglomerates and by farmers still using wooden ploughs on tiny plots. It also touches an industry that is heavily subsidized in many countries.\u000a\u000aDutch Agriculture Minister Henk Bleker said funding for \u201cclimate-smart\u201d agriculture should be integrated into U.N. negotiations.\u000a\u000aInvestment \u201cin agricultural development has been declining in the last 10 years,\u201d Mr. Bleker told reporters. \u201cWe want to change that.\u201d\u000a\u000aNegotiators reconvene in Cancun, Mexico, later this month, in the most important session since the summit last December in Copenhagen. That convention in Denmark fell short of any legally binding agreement to regulate the pollution blamed for global warming, concluding instead with a statement of principles.\u000a\u000aBut the leaders in Copenhagen agreed to channel $10 billion a year to developing countries through 2012, and to raise $100 billion annually starting in 2020 to help poor countries curb their own emissions and to adapt to changing climate conditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate change negotiators are frequently not familiar with agriculture,\u201d said the World Bank\u2019s special envoy on climate change, Andrew Steer. \u201cNobody expects a global deal at Cancun, but there will surely be one before too long,\u201d and agriculture must be part of it, he told the conference earlier this week.\u000a\u000aMr. Bleker said he was not suggesting that new money be found for climate-friendly agriculture policies, but that farming issues be factored in when the climate funds are distributed to developing countries. Sixty government ministers were among the 800 participants.\u000a\u000aProducing what it called a \u201croadmap for action,\u201d the conference called for governments to provide access to financing, markets and technology, while acknowledging that private business will play a huge role.\u000a\u000aAmong its list of recommended actions was the restoration of degraded land, new systems of water conservation and harvesting, and better management of animal waste that produces powerful greenhouse gases.

The 21-member advisory group set up to chart a course to meet this goal includes Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, as well as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, economist Nicholas Stern and financier George Soros.\u000a\u000aTerming the target as \u201cchallenging but feasible,\u201d the report says that financing could come from both public and private sources.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we are to reach this goal, we will need a mix of new public sources, a scaling-up of existing public sources and increased private flows. A carbon price in the range of $20-25 by 2020 will be important to meet the goal,\u201d it said. While carbon trades at about that level in the European market today, many other developed countries \u2013 significantly, the United States \u2013 have resisted any move to put a price on carbon. However, this could potentially raise $30 billion per year, and would also provide incentives for further mitigation actions, according to the advisory group.\u000a\u000aThe report also called for exploring revenue sources such as international carbon taxes. This could mean a tax or trading system for the fuel emissions of international airlines or merchant ships, or even a fee on passenger air tickets, which has the potential to raise $10 billion per year. Taxing forex transactions could garner another $10 billion. Further carbon taxes in developed countries and redeploying fossil fuel subsidies could be other sources of funding.\u000a\u000aThe report will be discussed at the next U.N. climate summit to be held in Cancun, Mexico, later this month. Concrete pledges and action on climate funding is seen as crucial to the negotiations to be held there. \u201cWithout an agreement on finance we won't reach an agreement on climate,\u201d warned the Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, a co-chair of the advisory group.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not about charity. It is about doing the right thing for those who are suffering most from a crisis that they did least to cause,\u201d said U.N. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon, while accepting the report.

How does it feel to your inner greenie? To me, it is ironic, but also, an important reflection of our times.\u000a\u000aIn few weeks, India will participate in the Cancun Conference of Parties, to discuss what to do next on climate change. Some developed nations will try to bully India to make commitments to cut down its emissions. India will have to remind the world that we can\u2019t expect to get out of our poverty levels without coal and without a spurt in equitable growth and thus, a spurt in emissions. We will have to tell them of their historic IOU to the developing world.\u000a\u000aBut India must acknowledge this irony of celebrating coal. I think at least 10% of the net revenues should be kept aside for investment in green and renewable sources of energy. Coal India must also spare no efforts to audit its mine \u2014 to manufacture life cycle, and minimise emissions. Of course this is limited, as coal is coal, but it\u2019s better than not acting at all.

Last week, the campaign was more or less laid to rest. What now?\u000a\u000aThere is no doubt that government has to control the air quality, including the pollution from crackers. We have to tax crackers, even if they are made in cottage industries. It\u2019s a disincentive we must try out, regardless of the manufacturer protests.

a((VNEW DELHI: Stating that America had a role to play in India 's first Green Revolution four decades ago, the US today offered its advanced farm technology , research and other related expertise to make the revolution "evergreen.""Together, we can strengthen agriculture. Cooperation between Indian and American researchers and scientists sparked the Green Revolution..."Now, as farmers and rural areas face the effects of climate change and drought, we will work together to spark a second, more sustainable Evergreen Revolution ," US President Barack Obama said in his address to members of both houses of Parliament.Earlier in the day, Obama had announced the launch of new partnership for an evergreen revolution for improving global food security.Obama said the co-operation would be in the areas of weather and crop forecasting system, improvement in the food processing and crop productivity, and optimum uses of natural resources like water."Together, we are improving Indian weather forecasting systems before the next monsoon season," he told members of both the Houses.India had faced its worst drought in 2009, which badly affected agriculture production, particularly paddy."We aim to help millions of Indian farmers and farming households save water and increase productivity, improve food processing so crops don't spoil on the way to market, and enhance climate and crop forecasting to avoid losses that cripple communities and drive up food prices," Obama said.He noted that India is a leader in using technology to empower farmers, while the US is a leader in agricultural productivity and research.As part of global food security initiative, Obama said: "We are going to share India's expertise with farmers in Africa and this is an indication of India's rise and we can exploit hard-earned expertise to countries that sees India as a model for agriculture development."India and US had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2010 to co-operate in agriculture and food security. Three working groups were formed to identify the area of co-operation between the two countries.

The 35 nations agreed that giving poorer countries access to technology that can reduce emissions should form part of any \u201ccomprehensive and balanced\u201d package finalised in Cancun. The technology transfer mechanism should address both adaptation and mitigation, the summary said.\u000a\u000aThere was no mention of contentious issue of intellectual property rights (IPR), on which Ramesh said there were divergent views.

The credibility of the entire climate change negotiating system is at stake. If you do not get a set of operational and meaningful decisions at Cancun, everybody is going to get sick and tired of us.\u201d\u000a\u000aProspects for the 29 Nov-10 Dec climate change talks in the Mexican resort of Cancun have dimmed in recent months because of near-deadlock in the 194-nation negotiations over how to share the burden in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aRamesh had earlier hosted a climate meeting in New Delhi, drawing on delegates from 35 countries including China, the United States, Mexico and the European Union, as well as a host of smaller developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe focus of the meeting was to push agreement for a mechanism to develop and transfer technology to tackle climate change. The meeting pushed for such a mechanism to be a \u201ckey deliverable\u201d at Cancun, a statement said.\u000a\u000aReaching an agreement in Cancun to extend the Kyoto Protocol was a make-or-break issue for developing countries and would determine the outcome of any future discussions, Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aSome nations want the Kyoto Protocol extended into a second period, others such as Japan and the United States, which never ratified Kyoto, want a new treaty. Many developing nations back an extension to Kyoto because it enshrines wording that allows poorer nations to take voluntary steps to curb emissions.\u000a\u000aLast year\u2019s UN climate talks in Copenhagen failed in its goal of working out a legally binding treaty.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must have a practical approach to solve the problems in front of us and not repeat positions like a mantra,\u201d Ramesh said.

These negotiations would take place again at Cancun in Mexico from November 29.\u000a\u000aThe two-day technology seminar, that got underway in New Delhi on Tuesday, is the second in the series. The first was held last year in run-up to the Copenhagen conference.\u000a\u000aOpening the discussions, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said the countries, especially from the developing world, needed to focus their energies on evolving a common ground on how technology was to be shared. He said there were existing models for international cooperation that can be replicated for climate change and a knowledge pool created for the benefit of countries that do not have the resources to develop such technologies by themselves.\u000a\u000aRamesh said the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, which helped usher in the Green Revolution, was a good example to follow. The countries are expected to leave aside contentious issues \u2014 like how to deal with intellectual property rights \u2014 and concentrate on the broadly agreed principles.\u000a\u000aAfter two days, the countries are expected to come out with a summary of agreements that would be treated as an input for climate change negotiations in Cancun later this month.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Narendra Modi a monster, Trinamool has pact with him: Buddha\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VNEW DELHI: Ahead of the UN climate meet in Cancun India on Wednesday warned that the global negotiations may collapse if there was no extension for Kyoto Protocol which sets binding greenhouse gas emission targets on rich nations from 2013 to 2018."Extension of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the time being is non-negotiable. There has to be second Kyoto Protocol. We can't find any agreement on other issues if Kyoto is going to be abdicated at Cancun, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told reporters here.Otherwise, "I think all countries have ... most developed and developing countries have shown considerable flexibility including India, China, Brazil and South Africa (belonging to BASIC group)" he said.Ramesh was replying to a question how far developing countries were ready to be flexible to get a climate deal at the Cancun climate meet scheduled from November 29.He was talking to reporters on the outcome of the two-day ministerial dialogue on "climate change: technology mechanism," held here and the position India would take at the Cancun.The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 and the overall climate talks so far has been moving on two tracks.The first track is LCA under Bali Action Plan that requires parties to produce a legally-binding treaty before the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012 and the second track is extension of the Kyoto Protocol into the second commitment period from 2013 to 2018 where developed countries listed under Annex B will have to take binding cuts.Making it amply clear that the Kyoto Protocol must continue to form the legal basis for emission reduction commitments beyond 2012, a position that India would take at the crucial UN talks, Ramesh favoured an extension of the second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol after 2012.Based on the foundational principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities under Kyoto Protocol, developed countries are bound to take emission cuts while developing nations have no such obligations.However, Mexican Environment Minister Juan Rafael Elvira Quesada, who was also present on the occasion, suggested there was a need to work on some other additional complimentary instruments to Kyoto Protocol.

The plan identifies eight core \u201cnational missions\u201d on the menace running through 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut now we are actually reverting the process and putting together elements of the plans based on daily experience of people and community who are actually facing impacts of climate change,\u201d the minister said,noting that India is the \u201cmost vulnerable country\u201d to climate change.\u000a\u000aNoting that adaptation to climate change has to be a community-driven process,Ramesh said the common people should be involved in drafting policies in this regard.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt cannot be a government mandated process. Elected panchayats,self-help groups and various NGOs have to be involved in drafting government policies on how to deal with the threat,\u201d the minister said.\u000a\u000aHe maintained there was no country in the world which was as severely affected as India and identified four major dimensions of climate change faced by the people here.\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst,two-thirds of India\u2019s population is still dependent on the monsoon,which is impacted by climate change. If we look over the last fifty-years,almost 55 per cent of the variation in our GDP has come from variation in rainfall alone.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecond is rise in sea level which would adversely affect the livelihood of around 250 million people of the country who live in the coastal areas,\u201d Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aHe said the third area of vulnerability is the threat to water security due to the melting of glaciers whose health remains a major area of concern as revealed by various studies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fourth demising comes from the confluence of great mineral wealth with the forest cover. The more coal we use,the more forests we are going to destroy which would in turn result into more greenhouse gas (GHG) emission,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aRenowned agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan also shared similar views and said that common and differentiated impact of climate change at various level need to be studied.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

a((VFile photo shows the rainforest in Kakum National Park, Ghana. A warming world will not do as much damage to forests as feared, a new study says.\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aIt is generally acknowledged that a warming world will harm the world\u2019s forests. Higher temperatures mean water becomes more scarce, spelling death for plants \u2014 or perhaps not always.\u000a\u000aBut according to a study of ancient rainforests, trees may be hardier than previously thought. Carlos Jaramillo, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), examined pollen from ancient plants trapped in rocks in Colombia and Venezuela. \u201cThere are many climactic models today suggesting that ... if the temperature increases in the tropics by a couple of degrees, most of the forest is going to be extinct,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we found was the opposite to what we were expecting: we didn\u2019t find any extinction event [in plants] associated with the increase in temperature, we didn\u2019t find that the precipitation decreased.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a study published in Science, Mr. Jaramillo and his team studied pollen grains and other biological indicators of plant life embedded in rocks formed around 56 million years ago, during an abrupt period of warming called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. CO 2 levels had doubled in 10,000 years and the world was warmer by 3°C-5°C for 200,000 years.\u000a\u000aContrary to expectations, he found that forests bloomed with diversity.\u000a\u000aNew species of plants, including those from the passionflower and chocolate families, evolved quicker as others became extinct. The study also shows moisture levels did not decrease significantly during the warm period. \u201cIt was totally unexpected,\u201d Mr. Jaramillo said of the findings.\u000a\u000aKlaus Winter of the STRI added: \u201cIt is remarkable that there is so much concern about the effects of greenhouse conditions on tropical forests. However, these horror scenarios probably have some validity if increased temperatures lead to more frequent or severe drought as some of the current predictions suggest.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast year, researchers at the London Met Office Hadley Centre reported that a 2°C rise above pre-industrial levels, widely considered the best-case scenario, would still see 20-40 per cent of the Amazon die off within 100 years. A 3°C rise would see 75 per cent of the forest destroyed by drought in the next century, while a 4°C rise would kill 85 per cent.\u000a\u000aMr. Jaramillo found that the plants he studied seemed to become more efficient with their water use when it became more scarce. But he also cautioned that future risks for the world\u2019s plant species did not end with climate change. Human action would continue to determine the fate of the world\u2019s forests, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the fossil record is showing is that plants have already the genetic variability to cope with high temperature and high levels of CO 2 .

a((VNEW DELHI: Use of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) in countries like India is "criminal", Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said on Friday and pitched the need for evolving an effective fuel policy regime to discourage the use of such vehicles that emit more carbons."The luxurious growth of large-size vehicles like SUVs is really a growth of concern... use of vehicles like SUVs and BMW in countries like India is criminal," Ramesh said at a UN function here."I think, we seriously need to think about fuel policy regime," he said.The Minister said there should be a reformed diesel policy as the real beneficiaries of the diesel subsidy are the owners of the "BMWs, the Benzs and Hondas" and not farmers."We are subsidising diesel. We have reformed policy as far as petrol is concerned. We are yet to reform as far as the net effect of diesel subsidy is concerned," he said."The subsidy in the social security sector should be really for LPG and kerosene," he said, adding that to control carbon emission, there was a need to have a fuel policy regime."And certainly put a penalty on the type of cars that you don't want to see on the roads which is diesel driven car, SUVs," the minister said."We can not ask people to buy or not to buy a particular car. But through an effective fiscal policy, we can certainly have an impact," he said.Ramesh said the transport sector contribute 7.5 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the country and this is expected to be 15 per cent in the next 15 to 20 years."We are worried and we are looking at how to control these emissions from transport sector. For this to happen, there should be mandatory fuel efficiency standards," he said.The minister added that a national transport policy committee has been constituted and the committee will give its recommendations in next 12 to 15 months.Dismissing the notion that the increased use of electric car will help reduce carbon emission, the minister said those who advocation for it thinks that "electricity comes from heavens."

a((VRank depression had set in following last year’s UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen,which many believed had provided the world its best opportunity yet to craft a global plan to limit carbon emissions. No binding agreement was reached; a meeting of environment ministers later this month in Cancun is also not expected to yield much progress,especially after the recent Republican victory in the US mid-term elections. At the same time,many scientists believe that even if countries agreed to a plan to significantly decrease carbon emissions,it may be too late. 2010 is well on its way to being the warmest year on record,and the earth could have already passed a tipping point after which serious disruption to our climate and,in turn,our economic and political systems,becomes inevitable.\u000a\u000aIn the face of these political failures and mounting concerns in the scientific community,many are looking to a “Plan B” in which humans actively intervene to control the earth’s climate — or geoengineering. Although geoengineering is still rarely discussed in India,it should not be ignored. India,like much of the world,may soon find itself alternatively looking to geoengineering for salvation and as a potential threat.\u000a\u000aAlthough it may sound fanciful,congressional and parliamentary committees in both the US and Britain are encouraging further study of geoengineering and have agreed that “consideration for the[ir regulatory arrangements\u2026 needs to start now.” Indeed,“serious” scientists,like Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen,think geoengineering might be our best hope to avoid climate calamity. Last year,a prominent panel of economists,including three Nobel Prize winners and Jagdish Bhagwati,ranked geoengineering alternatives on the basis of costs and benefits,and recommended immediate research into several of them.\u000a\u000aThere are two commonly proposed types of geoengineering options. The first involves removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Its proponents advocate alternatives like spreading special plankton in the ocean to soak up carbon at a far faster rate than plant life on the planet currently can. The second form of geoengineering most frequently suggested involves reflecting some of the sun’s rays away from the planet,such as by shooting phosphorous into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling effects of a volcano. Both geoengineering alternatives build on natural processes that already affect the climate,but humans would intervene in new ways to amplify and direct these effects.\u000a\u000aIndia should study the solutions that geoengineering proposals promise seriously. India is,after all,under current projections,likely to be amongst the countries worst hit by climate change. It is also of concern,though,that were geoengineering to go wrong,the consequences could potentially be worse than climate change itself. For example,the monsoon could inadvertently be affected,causing widespread crop failure on the sub-continent. Equally,we should be mindful that some recommending it might be interested merely in maintaining the status quo.\u000a\u000aEven if humans successfully controlled the effects of geoengineering,it would produce a thicket of governance challenges. Countries like Russia might be agriculturally more productive with an earth two degrees warmer,while India might be better off with an earth two degrees cooler than today. Who would decide the earth’s temperature? The question could cause open conflict between countries,or citizens and their governments.\u000a\u000aIndia needs to ensure that it has both the technical and political expertise to respond to geoengineering proposals. Proposals come in various forms: for example,simply planting more trees to soak up carbon to decrease the world’s temperature,technically counts as geoengineering. But that is intervention of a different degree from putting an aerosol into the atmosphere to reflect the sun to cool the planet. India,like other countries,needs to be able to independently study the merits of these proposals,while at the same time encouraging that any decisions about geoengineering take place in as global and democratic a forum as possible.\u000a\u000aThe status quo on climate change is becoming more and more unviable. Increased discussion of geoengineering alternatives,and even reported small-scale testing,including by a German-Indian expedition near Antarctica last year,signal that the debate is shifting. Seriously limiting carbon emissions should still be the first goal as the world meets in Cancun later this month,but if this fails or proves inadequate,large-scale adaptation or geoengineering may be the only other options left. Adaptation — moving vulnerable populations,changing farming practices,building dikes against the sea,and so on — may ultimately prove preferable to the risks of geoengineering,but geoengineering can no longer be ignored. To this,India and the rest of the world will have to adjust.\u000a\u000aThe writer is an assistant professor at Jindal Global Law School,Sonipat express@expressindia.com\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

Radhakrishnan on Saturday.\u000a\u000aInaugurating an international conference on \u2018Recent advances in space technology services and climate change \u2013 2010,' at Sathyabama University, he said that ISRO and the French National Space Agency (CNES) would be launching Megha-Tropiques by mid-2011 to study tropical climate. While two sensors were developed by CNES, ISRO jointly worked on a sensor. Another ISRO-CNES mission to be launched next year is SARAL (Satellite for Argos and Altika) for seasonal forecasting, oceanography and climate studies.\u000a\u000aThe ISRO would provide the platform and overseeing satellite operations, including launch, orbit acquisition and station keeping. The CNES would provide the payload and process data.\u000a\u000aThe Indo-French joint missions are part of the synergy among nations to work in the areas of space technology and climate change, he said.\u000a\u000aIndia had been invited to be part of the International Space Station and discussions were on the nature of scientific experiments to be conducted on board.\u000a\u000aAlso to be launched next year, the Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1), a microwave remote sensing satellite, will provide all-weather surveillance. Hylas, a communication satellite, would be launched on November 27; GSAT -5P in December and RESOURCESAT- 2 along with YOUTHSAT in January 2011.\u000a\u000aVikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) director P.S. Veeraraghavan said that ISRO was working on semi-cryogenic, green liquid and green solid propellants for reduction of green house gases, which could reduce cost of launch operations.\u000a\u000aNational Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) director V. Jayaraman said the space technology could provide unbiased inputs to find out climate change variables and monitor change. Professors Matthias Roth and Wong Nyuk Hien of the National University of Singapore delivered special lectures.\u000a\u000aSathyabama University founder and chancellor Jeppiar presided.

a((VA new United Nation\u2019s report on climate change has predicted tougher times ahead for India with the earth\u2019s expected to become much more warmer, than predicted earlier, because of rise in the green house emissions.\u000a\u000aHigher sea level rise on the eastern coast, more rainfall in the post monsoon period, effecting crop patterns, and the drought zone widening are said to be predictions of the fourth assessment report of International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u000a\u000aThe global report, prepared by 500 lead authors and scientists, also says that India will emerge as one of the major carbon dioxide contributors to global green house emissions if the remedial steps are not taken fast. India\u2019s booming economy and consequent rise in energy consumption are the cause.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC, before the release of the report in Paris on Friday, clarified that any reference to the contents before approval at the IPCC plenary session does not represent authorised IPCC findings. \u201cThe process leading to the release is \u201clong, complicated and far from complete,\u201d IPCC said, in a recent statement. Dr RK Pachauri, who heads the panel, was not available for his comments.\u000a\u000aThe findings of the report have not surprised Indian scientists. \u201cMost of the findings of the report are already known,\u201d said Dr Sugata Hazra, head of Department of Oceanography at Jadhavpur University. His team had recorded submersion of the world\u2019s first habituated island in Sunderbans in 2006. \u201cThere are many more islands heading for a similar fate if the sea level rises at the present rate,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHazra has a slightly different take on sea level rise as predicted in the UN report. \u201cThe 60-70 cm rise in seal level predicted by IPCC for the end of 2100 is very moderate and less than its earlier prediction. I believe that seas will rise much more leading to submersion of low lying areas,\u201d he said, admitting of IPCC\u2019s limitation on CO emission data and the pressure from industry and rich countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe draft assessment report of the IPCC is first validated by 154 nations before adoption at the plenary session. The draft report was send to all nations, including United States, which put the report on its website for comments inviting furious remarks from the scientists.\u000a\u000aThe report not only provides models for possible rise in temperature on earth\u2019s surface and its impact on humanity, it also provides solutions for the government to adopt. The last IPCC report was released in 2001.\u000a\u000aEmail Chetan Chauhan: chetan@hindustantimes.com

a((VThe government is working on a policy to price water to minimise its wastage, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on Sunday. A group of ministers under the chairmanship of agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has been created to form a policy on this, he said.\u000a\u000aAt the level of Planning Commission, we have to suggest what could be the key elements of this policy. We are working with the ministry of water resources and will submit our recommendations in a few months, Montek told reporters at the India Economic Summit.\u000a\u000aAhluwalia said the government will set water conservation and efficiency target in the 12th five year plan that starts April 2012.\u000a\u000aAs per the National Water Mission, which is one of the eight points of the National Action Plan on climate change, the country has to increase water-use efficiency by 20% by 2017. As per industry estimates and research reports, India is projected to have a 50% shortage of water by 2030. By that time, Indias key competitor China will reduce the demand-supply gap to half.\u000a\u000aSources said under the policy, the government may set up Bureau of Water Efficiency on the lines of Bureau of Energy Efficiency, which sets standards for energy-consuming home appliances and buildings.\u000a\u000aAhluwalia said rationing of water is required to bring in efficiency in the use of water. By water rationing I dont mean that less water should be supplied, but that we can price water so that people use water as per requirement. In India, we have to pay for using energy but not water. A fee should be charged for using water too. However, different slabs of this fee can be formed, he said.\u000a\u000aThe costing model, he said, will help in meeting the cost of sewerage that is created by use of water. The pricing is difficult. It requires political leadership, but is perfectly possible, Ahluwalia said.\u000a\u000aIIP data unlikely to hit growth\u000a\u000aPlanning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia on Sunday said that although growth in Indias industrial production has been lower than expected we should not become judgmental based on monthly numbers. The latest data shows that Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which stands as a measure of factory output, grew 4.4% in September this year against the same month last year. The growth in IIP has been lower than expected. But lets see how it goes for the rest of the year, Ahluwalia told reporters on the sidelines of India Economic Summit.\u000a\u000aHowever, he said the slowing growth in IIP is unlikely to hinder the economic growth. We should not become judgmental based on monthly numbers. I still believe that our earlier projection of 8.5% economic growth will hold for the entire year, he said.

The innovation and creativity of business wont just help us save the planet, but is expected to create millions of jobs and billions of revenue in the green goods and services market. The group had met in New Delhi during Camerons trip to India.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh added in his message: This is a remarkable initiative initiated by the prime ministers of our two countries, and I am delighted that the best minds from our business communities sat across the table and have given us their best ideas. We strongly believe that while governments can provide the policy frameworks and fiscal incentives, ultimately the technology choices and operational actions have to come from the business community.\u000a\u000aThe UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group is chaired by Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director, Bharti Enterprises and Stuart Rose, chairman, Marks & Spencer are co-chairs of the group.\u000a\u000aIts recommendation include setting up a technology development online resource to link up early stage Indian technology firms with investors in the UK, laying down a low-carbon capital manual on how to raise capital and spur public private investment in low carbon economy, and organising a high-level, low-carbon economy summit next year in India.\u000a\u000aThe charter of principles provides for setting up demonstration projects to catalyse investment in low-carbon industries, coming up with innovative financial mechanisms to break barriers in investment, undertake joint research and skill building programmes.

This makes it imperative for us to have sound evidence-based assessments on the impact of climate change,\u201d said the Environment Minister, Mr Jairam Ramesh.\u000a\u000aReleasing the report, Mr Kapil Sibal, Minister for Human Resource Development and Science and Technology, said India needs micro-level studies to understand the climate change issues as the impact varied from region to region.\u000a\u000aForecasting an overall warming in all regions, the report predicts that temperatures would rise by 1.7 to 2.2 degrees, with the maximum increase in coastal regions. Besides, the Himalayas, the North\u2013Eastern region and the Western Ghats would see increase in precipitation of rainfall, snow and storm, it said.\u000a\u000aStating that it is a preliminary report on differentiated impact of climate change on various sectors in various regions, Mr Ramesh said it has some alarming and some positive trends.\u000a\u000aCrops such as irrigated rice and coconut would see an improvement in productivity, while the yields of maize, sorghum and apple would be impacted, the report said. Further, the warming may benefit the marine fisheries segment as certain species such as sardines and the Indian mackerel would see an improvement in yields. However, production of milk could be impacted due to the rising thermal humidity index leading to stress to the livestock, especially May and June.\u000a\u000aThe sea levels along the Indian coast, which has been rising at the rate of 1.3 mm per year, is likely to rise in consonance with the global sea level rise in future. Further, the projections indicate that the frequency of cyclones is likely to decrease in 2030, with the increase in cyclonic intensity, the report said.\u000a\u000aFurther, the report predicts that flooding would increase by up to 30 per cent across all regions, while the Himalayas would face moderate to extreme drought conditions. Increasing temperatures would result in spreading of tropical diseases such as malaria in the Himalayas, while the transmission was likely to increase for a longer period in the North-East.\u000a\u000aThe report is the second publication by INCAA, which had earlier brought out a report on India's Green House Gas emissions inventory. Mr Ramesh said the third report to be released in November next year would look at the impact of black carbon.

a((VLONDON: Business leaders of hundreds of companies from around the world, including India, have released a renewed demand for "an ambitious, robust and equitable global deal on climate change".They say companies companies are already investing in a low-carbon future and governments must respond to this by both redoubling efforts to secure an international framework but also by pursuing an ambitious "parallel mitigation strategy".The statement - known as The Cancun Communique - is an initiative of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, which is a cross-sectoral group of major international companies working with the University of Cambridge to call for more ambitious action to tackle climate change, a university release said.The Communique was presented by corporate leaders from the group to European Commissioner for Climate Action , Connie Hedegaard, and the Ambassador of Mexico to the EU, H E Sandra Fuentes-Berain in Brussels yesterday.They were joined by Ambassadors and Government Representatives from the European Parliament, Australia, Canada, Japan, India, South Africa, Turkey, UK, and US.Commissioner Hedegaard said: "Major investments are needed to develop a low-carbon economy and for Europe to continue to lead in this field.This will require a continued involvement of the private sector, along with ambitious and proactive interventions by governments".This is part of a series of events to present the Communiqué to decision makers around the world and invite further support from the business community.The Cancun Communiqué is the successor to previous communiqués such as the Bali, Poznan, and Copenhagen Communiqués.The Cancun Communiqué has already secured the support of more than 250 companies based in over 36 countries, and is expected to gather much more support before UN negotiators meet in Cancun, on 29 November.Communiqué signatories include some of the world's largest companies and best known brands in the energy, professional services, transport, technology, manufacturing, telecommunications and banking sectors from countries including the EU, Mexico, US, Japan, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, China and South Africa.

a((VINCHEON (SOUTH KOREA): India's efforts on disaster risk reduction came in for praise by the United Nations at the recently concluded 4th Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction ( DRR ) hosted by South Korea's National Emergency Management Agency here.Margareta Wahistrom, special representative of the UN secretary-general on DRR, said India did a commendable job in the post-tsunami rehabilitation work and has since taken a number of steps towards reduction of disaster risk. She, however, called for the government to incorporate DRR in its national policy to cope with climate change.The four-day ministerial conference called for governments to earmark at least 10% of all rescue and rehabilitation funds towards disaster risk reduction. It also adopted a five-year regional roadmap on DRR and climate change adaptation, which includes capacity building activities, enhanced information sharing and solutions to manage climate risks using various technologies.India has been effectively using technology such as SMS, radio, television, watch towers and loudspeakers in disaster risk zones to communicate to its population on eviction in time of danger. It is in the process of activating a regional warning centre on gathering seismological and tidal data to send out alerts to coastal regions. Currently, the warning centre on seismological data is in Japan and Hawaii which have been sending alerts to national agencies in Indian Ocean countries.Highlighting the importance for countries like India to invest in disaster risk, the UN official said since half of the world GDP falls in the disaster risk zone, countries which have not invested in DRR are more likely to fail in achieving their full economic potential.A new joint report from the World Bank and the United Nations, released last week, said annual global losses from natural disasters could triple to $185 billion by the end of this century, even without calculating the impact of climate change.Climate change could then add $28 to $68 billion more in damages each year from tropical cyclones alone, the report said. The report also said that the number of people exposed to storms and earthquakes in large cities could double to 1.5 billion by 2050.The 250-page report, `Natural Hazards, Unnatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention' was targeted at the world's finance ministers and stressed on prevention as that alone pays to mitigate the economic impact.It went on to suggest removing rent controls, something India can take notice of as the report pointed out that by doing so, it would bring in incentives for landlords to maintain buildings and thus result in less number of mishaps and deaths. This is important, in view of how a poorly constructed building in Delhi collapsed resulting in 67 deaths.

a((VNEW DELHI: By 2030, the average temperatures in India will rise by 1.7-2.2 degree Celsius in India and extreme temperatures by 1-4 degree Celsius in comparison to the 1970s. The hotter summers and warmer winters will lead to substantial changes in agricultural production, water flows and cause dramatic changes in the country's weather, a report of the government's Indian Network for Climate Change Assessment has said.The report released on Tuesday noted that in all regions of the country rainfall will increase, with central and north-western Himalayan region suffering the brunt of the highest increases. Worse, the high rainfall days (extreme rainfall events) in the country is bound to increase.The 7,500-km coastline will face its own problems with sea level along the Indian coast rising at the rate of 1.3mm/year and the intensity of cyclones expected to increase though the frequency would reduce.The report notes that severe droughts will see a moderate to extreme increase in the Himalayan region and floods will intensify by 10-30% in all the regions of the country.The government's attempt to start a second green revolution in dryland areas could also be tested with the non-irrigated crops suffering a productivity decline though the irrigated paddy areas may gain productivity in some zones. Maize and sorghum are projected to have reduced yields in all the regions. The coconut productivity is projected to rise in the western coast and reduce in the eastern coastal region. The story of failing production of apples in states like Himachal Pradesh is bound to continue in future, the study done by 18 Indian scientific institutions for the government notes.Lifestock productivity -- backbone of the farming sector -- will decrease in general and there will be substantial changes in the fisheries too with some gains and losses and shifts in patterns causing fisherfolk to adjust to such alterations.The incidence of malaria will increase in the Himalayan region though it will come down in the coastal belts by 2030 due to the changes in moisture and temperatures caused by climate change.The government plans to produce another report by May 2012 studying the impact of climate change on all 16 agro-climatic zones and also hold an Indian International Climate Science Congress once every two years starting with the first one in November 2011.

Leaders from various regions of the world will gather in New Delhi for the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit (DSDS) beginning Friday, the first major global meeting after the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. (AP Photo/ Anupam Nath) | Photo Credit: Anupam Nath\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aDeveloped countries are failing to meet the funding pledges that they made at the Climate Summit in Copenhagen last December to support developing countries' climate efforts. At the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP-15) in Copenhagen, developed countries had committed to provide resources \u201capproaching $30 billion for the period 2010-12\u201d.\u000a\u000aThis so-called \u2018fast start finance' was intended to help the developing countries, in particular the poorest and the most vulnerable, reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. Further, the Copenhagen Accord mandated that fast start funds have a \u201cbalanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation\u201d and are \u201cnew and additional.\u201d Fast-start adaptation funding is particularly crucial for poor countries facing rapid climate change.\u000a\u000a\u2018Pledges inadequate'\u000a\u000a\u201cBut so far, pledges for adaptation from developed countries have been inadequate and unclear,\u201d says a \u2018briefing paper' just published by the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). \u201cAs of October 2010, donors have pledged highly variable amounts and types of funding, and have set aside only a slim portion for adaptation,\u201d adds the paper.\u000a\u000aAccording to an analysis done by the World Resources Institute (WRI), on which the IIED briefing is based, only about $3.14 billion has been formally allocated for adaptation. \u201cThere is also a danger that this could come in the form of loans which would further indebt already poor nations,\u201d notes Dr. Saleemul Huq of the IIED, one of the authors of the paper.\u000a\u000aLess adaptation funding\u000a\u000aOf the total amount of $28.46 billion fast-start funds pledged so far, adaptation funding represents only 11 to 15.9 per cent, which is clearly far from a \u2018balanced' financing of adaptation measures. It should be pointed out here that during climate negotiations, poorer countries have consistently stressed the need for high levels of adaptation funding.\u000a\u000aMany developed countries have not provided details of how their pledges will be realised. For instance, Belgium, Finland and France have not indicated their proposed share of adaptation funds. Assuming that they allocate 50 per cent of their pledges to adaptation \u2014 as per the Copenhagen Accord mandate \u2014 the total adaptation funds add up to only $4.5 billion, 15.9 per cent of all the fast-start funds pledged.\u000a\u000aNot \u2018new and additional'\u000a\u000aAlso a number of pledges are not \u201cnew and additional.\u201d They are renamed commitments made earlier either under ODA or other. For instance, the U.S. (adaptation component 33.8 per cent) and the U.K. (13.5 per cent) have counted their previous commitments to Climate Investment Funds (CIF) as part of fast-start finance pledge.\u000a\u000aMore significantly, most of the donors have not specified how they will channel the fast-start funds. Only $250.7 million has been designated to be delivered through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) channels. Of this, the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund specifically has received only $73.9 million in pledges. Large amounts have, however, already been directed to the World Bank and other agencies controlled mainly by the developed countries, the IIED paper points out.\u000a\u000aThis is contrary to the Copenhagen Accord, which promised delivery of adaptation funds through a mechanism whose governance would give equal representation to developed and developing nations.\u000a\u000aIn the run-up to the COP-16 negotiations at Cancun, Mexico, beginning on November 29, this clearly points to the continuing lack of trust between developed and developing countries, something that was supposed to be slowly built after the acrimonious Copenhagen Summit.

It needs to be made clear who is going to enforce the contract and impose fines,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aHe also said that the success of the solar mission could also be constrained by the lack of a \u201ccomprehensive and transparent regulatory and tariff structure\u201d.\u000a\u000aIronically, the hurdles to the achievement of the solar mission were highlighted by the government too. \u201cWe must remember that this solar power fashion has come in the context of the fact that our power policy is in a colossal mess. We must get our fossil fuel policy right. If we are going to wait for the day when SEBs are reformed, we will lose the opportunity to light up millions of homes,\u201d said N K Singh, Member of Parliament (MP), who was also a part of the panel.\u000a\u000aSingh called for comprehensive solar legislation which should do away with the current regime of multiple regulatory approvals. \u201cThe solution to the problem also lies in promoting an off-grid solar model,\u201d he said. Other members of the panel included Pankaj Sehgal, managing director of the Sun Group, and Harish Hande, managing director of SELCO Solar Light, India.

a((VNoting that as countries were pushing ahead with their national agendas to combat climate change more intensely than setting international obligations,China was leading in combating the problem domestically,UN climate chief Christiana Figueres has said.\u000a\u000aFigueres pointed out that Beijing had \u201coutperformed\u201d the climate goal set in its 11th fifth year plan and was already designing climate legislation for the 12th plan to include clear targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no doubt the historic performance China has had on the 11th five year plan,\u201d Figueres told journalists during a press conference in Bonn,which was webcast live.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have not just performed to the level of their target but they have outperformed and it is well to think they will out perform again,\u201d she added.\u000a\u000aTwo weeks ahead of the annual meet on climate change,to be held in Cancun,Mexico,the UN climate chief observed that there is \u201coptimism for the planet\u201d since countries are taking climate change seriously at home.\u000a\u000aBesides China,the top UN official referred to small countries like Maldives and Costa Rica that had taken a pledge of carbon neutrality and were designing national mitigation action plans.\u000a\u000aThese plans,she said,\u201dwould help them achieve that neutrality by the second decade\u201d.\u000a\u000aAt the same time,Figueres noted that political differences and the inability to compromise were blocking progress on the international stage.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate is a global problem and ultimately can only have an ultimate global solution,\u201d Figueres said,noting that the agreement reached on biodiversity in Nagoya indicated that multilateral forums could be successful.\u000a\u000a\u201cCancun will be a success,if Parties compromise,\u201d she added.\u000a\u000aThe contentious climate meeting,last year,yielded the non-binding Copenhagen Accord,which called for limiting rise of global temperature to 2 degrees,100 billion dollars in long term finance to developing countries and 30 billion dollars to short-term finance to the poorest and most vulnerable countries.\u000a\u000aFigueres said that Cancun needed to end with a \u201cbalanced set of decisions\u201d in areas such as forestry,financing,mitigation and technology.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Cancun agreement must also address the mitigation efforts of industrialised countries as well as those developing countries that have already put mitigation intents on the table,\u201d the UN official said.\u000a\u000a\u201cCancun must also come to some resolution about what the continuation of Kyoto Protocol is going to be because that clearly affects the form of the mitigation commitments of those counties under the Kyoto Protocol,\u201d she added.\u000a\u000aThe Kyoto Protocol is the only treaty on climate change,which puts legally binding obligations on industrialised country.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries are always suspicious that developed countries are trying to weaken or abandon the treaty.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VAbout 10 days from today, the parties to the UN climate convention will have another bash at hammering out an agreement to avert what they all agree is one of the gravest threats that the world faces in the decades ahead. Is there any chance that they will do better there than at about a year go?\u000a\u000aThe elements of an international agreement needed to address the threat of are basically as follows:\u000a\u000aThe acceptable limit for the likely temperature increase.\u000a\u000aThe implied time profile of and other\u000a\u000aThe distribution of allowable global emissions among countries.\u000a\u000aThe commitments to programmes and policies that contain emissions to the agreed level.\u000a\u000aThe mechanisms that would allow flexibility in fulfilling commitments.\u000a\u000aThe mechanisms that would support adaptation actions.\u000a\u000aThe financial and technology transfer arrangements for compensating countries which take on more than their fair share of obligations.\u000a\u000aThe Accord includes a commitment to the goal of containing the likely average global temperature increase to 2º C. The time profile of global emissions needed to meet this goal is not uniquely defined as what matters are cumulative emissions. A path where emission reductions are low initially but accelerate later may have the same cumulative impact over decades as a path that paces the emission reductions more evenly. Be that as it may, a rough summary of the results of a variety of modelling studies is that:\u000a\u000aGlobal emissions must peak sometime between 2015 and 2021.\u000a\u000aGlobal emissions in 2020 should be approximately 40.0 to 48.3 Gt CO2 eq/yr.\u000a\u000aBy 2050 global emissions should decrease by 48 to 72 per cent relative to 2000.\u000a\u000aMoving from these global goals to national action is the core of the negotiating agenda and we are nowhere near an agreement on this. The pledges and commitments associated with the Accord add up to emissions of 48.8 to 51.2 Gt CO2 eq/yr in 2020 and in the words of a brief, \u201cthere is low confidence that the two-degree limit will be met\u201d*. The US pledge is a little up in the air as the Bill to give effect to it has not been passed. The main plus point is that the process has led to the announcement of goals for emission containment in the form of carbon intensity reductions by countries like China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and Mexico. There are a whole slew of issues like the legal form of the commitments and the monitoring, reporting and verification requirements that complicate the negotiations even further.\u000a\u000aThe central issue is that of equity in the sharing of scarce environmental space. Unfortunately, there is no agreed interpretation of fairness. The recognises the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility\u201d, the historical culpability of industrial countries which account for the bulk of the increase in ambient GHGs since the industrial revolution and the primacy of development for developing countries. But all this needs to be spelt out in terms of emission goals for countries. One concept under discussion in seminars, if not in the negotiations, is convergence to equal per capita emissions by a target date, say 2050, at a level consistent with containing emissions to ensure a 50 per cent chance of keeping the average global temperature increase to 2º C. India has already offered that it would ensure that its per capita emissions never exceeded the average for the developed countries, so that any action by them to reduce their emissions very substantially would act as a brake on India\u2019s emission growth. Another concept that has received some attention lately is that of carbon budgeting where the available room for carbon emissions, given agreed goals on temperature increase risks, would be shared as a stock on the basis of population. A more contentious proposal would do this but also take account of cumulative use from past emissions.\u000a\u000aAnnounced goals for emission reduction or containment are just aspirations and what matters is the translation of these into action. In the next decade, the main source of reductions will be energy efficiency and carbon sequestration through forest protection and reforestation. On forestry, the negotiations seem to be making good progress and there is also some real money in sight from Norway and others. If this is pursued separately and if an agreement on energy efficiency is stitched together at Cancun as part of some advance action even before a full agreement is reached, then we may well be back on the two-degree track.\u000a\u000aFlexibility mechanisms that allow companies and countries to \u201cbuy compliance\u201d by financing carbon saving actions by others are an attempt that purists frown upon and Pareto optimising economists love. At present, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is the main such avenue and its future beyond 2012 is in doubt because of the failure to agree on the next phase of commitments under the protocol. But the carbon market in a broader sense may still survive as long as there is some quantitative compliance obligation, even if it is nationally determined, that can be met by buying carbon credits.\u000a\u000aOn adaptation, financing of mitigation actions by developing countries and technology transfer, the Copenhagen Accord signalled some advance. But the subsequent processes, including the high level panel set up by the UN secretary general, have not brought us any closer to an agreement.\u000a\u000aThe prospects for closure at Cancun are not at all bright and everyone assumes that the game will go on at least for another year if not more. The world has become a victim of the normal framework of reciprocal concessions that dominates international negotiations and the \u201cnothing is agreed till everything is agreed\u201d rule. A mindset that starts from the ethical premise that national interest trumps all other considerations can never deliver an effective environmental agreement. We need sovereignty bargains in which each state surrenders some autonomy of action in order to acquire some influence on the policies of other states.\u000a\u000aIn the final analysis, the worst risks of can only be avoided by the acceptance that we are in one lifeboat and that steering it to safety requires that those who are most able put in a greater effort and those who are less able do what they can to avoid destabilising the boat.\u000a\u000anitin-desai@hotmail.com\u000a\u000a*UNEP, How close are we to the two-degree limit?, Information Note, UNEP, Nairobi, February 2010

Even when data collected by various national and regional government institutions was available, it was not made available to the researchers, they complained.\u000a\u000aEnvironment Minister Jairam Ramesh slammed the red tape and bureaucratic mindset that hindered legitimate research. \u201cThose very maps and classified data that we are denying to our researchers are freely accessible on Google,\u201d he said, urging Ministry officials to help breach the data barrier.\u000a\u000aHe stressed the need to develop Indian research, rather than relying on global scientific data and analysis. \u201cThis dependence on borrowed data, borrowed models, borrowed research has cost us politically,\u201d he said, noting that all impact assessments published in India have used a single climate model developed by the United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. Developing Indian capabilities would mean building human resources, especially the number of doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in this area.\u000a\u000aBlindly accepting Western science's prognosis could have social and economic costs for India, said Mr. Ramesh, pointing to flawed Western research on the Himalayan glaciers as well as on methane emissions from agriculture. \u201cClimate science today is not just a scientific enterprise, but also a political enterprise,\u201d he reminded the scientists. Among his aims, he said, is hosting an international conference on climate science in India and publishing a globally recognised academic journal on climate science.\u000a\u000aThe INCCA report, released by Science and Technology Minister Kapil Sibal, dealt with the impact of climate change by 2030 in the Himalayan region, the North-East, the Western Ghats and the coastal areas in the sectors of agriculture, water, health and forests. It projected a 1.7 to 2.2 degrees centigrade increase in annual temperatures, with the biggest increase coming in coastal regions. Sea level and rainfall will also rise, with cyclones becoming more intense, though less frequent. Flooding could increase up to 30 per cent, while drought becomes more severe in the Himalayas.\u000a\u000aWith warmer weather encouraging mosquitoes, malaria could spread to new areas in the Himalayas, and see higher rates in the North East as well.\u000a\u000aWhile irrigated rice may see marginal yield increases, maize, sorghum and apple could see reduced yields. The increase in thermal humidity will lead to stress in livestock and a reduction in milk productivity.\u000a\u000aEminent scientist and Rajya Sabha member M.S. Swaminathan urged more focus on agricultural impacts of climate change, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains and asked scientists to work on solutions as well.

Expect no surprises in Cancun.\u000a\u000aCopenhagen Flashback\u000a\u000aSummit possibilities\u000a\u000aIndia's Stand\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Climate Summit, held from December 6-18, 2009, was roundly dubbed a failure, largely put down to the inflexibility of developed nations. Picking up from Copenhagen will require a relook at the agreements made and not kept in full.The controversial Copenhagen accord asked the rich countries to provide $30 billion of quick money to poorest countries for 2010-2012. It asked the developed countries to provide $100 billion a year by 2020.Developing countries agreed to international consultation and analysis (ICA) of their domestic and voluntary actions to reduce emissions which they would list up with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Trust breaks down between countries with the Copenhagen Accord being forced through and causing bad blood.After Copenhagen, US tried hard to make the Copenhagen Accord the basis of all future negotiations. Developing countries refused to let that happen. Allowed the accord to influence decisions but not become the basic tablet of discussions.US turned on the pressure to make a detailed plan of ICA a pre-condition for talks on other issues.Japan and some others refused to let Kyoto Protocol continue. Some countries make a partial commitment to the $30 billion fast track money but the promises are dodgy.India hosts a climate technology summit, making some progress. Mexico, the host country, tries to push for a 'Mexico Mandate' \u2013 a set of decisions that seem to show a partial deal and a facesaver for the country.The Cancun climate summit will be held from November 29-December 10, 2010, after a series of warm-up meets in Bonn (Germany) and Tianjin (China), where positions have only become more firmly entrenched. Most major issues are likely to end in a stalemate while some other deals could make some progress.The countries have inched closer to getting the basic principles of a technology deal and a forestry deal through, but the details of even these is not in sight yet.The thorny issue of intellectual property rights on climate technologies has been shunted off the table, with US and Europe not keen to discuss it. Risk that it would be taken off for good.No hope of seeing developed countries give their targets under the second phase of Kyoto Protocol that isto start in 2012.Rich countries want as detailed a plan as possible on ICA of developing country actions but developingcountries not keen to let that happen till other elements of the deal \u2013 like targets of rich countries \u2013 are also presented.Developing countries want every element of the deal to be mentioned in the decision(s) that get adopted at Cancun so that progress on fronts amenable to them is also registered.By calling the issues that are close to developing countries' interests tricky and difficult, rich nations would like to push them for later discussions and right now, get other elements discussed.Still going through its split personality phase. It is firmly aligned with the BASIC group and will continue to do so at Cancun. But it's also helping progress on ICA though it does not have backing of China, South Africa and Brazil.PMO has been sitting on proposal to revamp of domestic and international climate governance structure since Shyam Saran resigned. Ex-babus and senior negotiators backed Saran in opposing Jairam Ramesh's line now out in the cold.At home, the committee on low-carbon growth plan set up in wake of the 20-25% emission intensity reduction target is still in limbo. The climate missions are more or less dragging slow, some almost showing little work.

The project is expected to lead to a saving of 27.87 million units of electric energy and emission reductions of 22,746 metric tonnes carbon di-oxide equivalent per annum.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, this project is unique and a first-of-its-kind from India to be registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000aIn the CDM process, projects are first registered in a central registry which verifies the technologies being used and validates the claim of emission reductions. Once the project is validated, the stream of carbon emission reductions (CERs) can be sold by the parties making the carbon emission reductions, and are purchased by parties which have been identified with a responsibility of reducing emissions. In the Kyoto protocol, the latter companies could postpone moving to more environmentaly friendly technologies by buying out carbon credits in the interim.\u000a\u000aThe CDM is therefore a market intervention whereby environmentally friendly projects can trade their reductions with companies which need to reduce but are unable to transform fast enough.\u000a\u000aAbout the project\u000a\u000aThe proposed project activity is an aggregation of solar water heater (SWH) installation at household, commercial, institutional and industrial facility to cater the low temperature hot water requirement. The project is based on the principle of utilisation of renewable energy (solar radiation received on the earth surface) to heat up ambient water to suffice the low temperature hot water requirement. Installation of SWH will substitute usage of electrical heaters used/to be used as the baseline options.\u000a\u000aThe project will result into:\u000a\u000aEnhancing Penetration of Solar Water heaters: There are substantial barriers to Solar Water heater Technology that is preventing its penetration or diffusion. Among the most pervasive barriers preventing the diffusion are related to high upfront investment, non supportive public policy framework, weak institution, lack of promotion and technological failure1. The purpose of the project activity is to introduce carbon finance as a vehicle towards providing incentives necessary to enhance the penetration of SWH system.\u000a\u000aReducing Green house gas emission and abate environmental pollution by refraining from the use of electric energy for water heating.\u000a\u000aElectrical Energy conservation thereby resulting in conservation of primary energy sources (fossil fuel).\u000a\u000aEnhance the investment environment for solar thermal market\u000a\u000aThe solar water-heater project is one more example of how Basix\u2019 business model is markedly different from other microfinance institutions. Instead of merely doling out small loans to the poor, Basix is engaged in livelihood promotion and financial inclusion of the poor of India, who have no recourse to bank credit. The 2.5 million euro windfall will certainly go a long way in livelihood promotion across villages in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka.

India is having only 0.5 per cent of the world\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves and it would be difficult to meet the growing energy demand unless alternative and renewable sources were tapped and utilised to minimise our dependency on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels,\u201d said Chairman and Managing Director\u000a\u000aAddressing India Inc at the organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), here, he said as part of its efforts to achieve for the nation, has ventured into exploration of shale gas reserves. It is also engaged in tapping non-conventional energy sources like solar, thermal energy, LED (light emitting diode) and fuel cells that emits less carbon.\u000a\u000aSharma said has also set up a 150 Mw wind power plant and the company\u2019s board has recently approved setting up of another 100 Mw wind energy plant. \u201cWe are looking at other natural sources to meet the growing energy needs of the country.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs it would be difficult to meet the increasing energy demand from non-renewable resources such as hydrocarbons, there is an urgent need to shift generation and consumption patterns to renewable sources such as hydel, wind, solar and nuclear fuel,\u201d said Sharma.\u000a\u000aThough India was about 70 per cent self-sufficient in exploring hydrocarbons and energy fuels during the mid-seventies, the phenomenal demand growth since then has resulted in importing a whopping 80 per cent of its energy needs. In the meantime, domestic production has declined to 20 per cent of the total demand, he observed.\u000a\u000aHe said India\u2019s ability to sustain high growth rate would be determined by the pace of infrastructure development and stability in the country. \u201cInfrastructure development pace and social-political stability in the country will be key to sustain the high growth rate,\u201d Sharma said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) had to grow over nine per cent per annum, infrastructure bottlenecks should be removed forthwith.\u000a\u000aOur infrastructure growth has been tardy and rumbling on for years. Like an elephant, it can stumble also. Unless we fix the inherent problems such as land acquisition and time-consuming procedures, early execution of various projects will remain a challenge,\u201d said Sharma in his address at the opening plenary of the three-day annual Quality Summit.\u000a\u000aHe also recalled the negative publicity India had across the world over the inordinate delays in completing infrastructure facilities for the 19th Commonwealth Games in New Delhi last month.\u000a\u000a\u2018Populism affecting growth\u2019\u000a\u000aPTI adds: Sharma slammed politicians opposing land acquisition for \u2018populism\u2019 and said such ideologies, along with poor infrastructure and lack of inclusive growth, would affect India\u2019s quest for sustained economic progress. \u201cIndian democracy (political interference) that comes (in the way) is a stumbling block (for infrastructure growth),\u201d he added.

The forests in the Western Ghats are vulnerable to this projected climate change," said HN Ravindranath , who heads the primier institute's forest and biodiversity assessment team.

a((VFormer US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore has been spreading the message of climate change, but his own country the United States, which is the world\u2019s second largest polluter, has failed to pass a law to fight global warming. He spoke to Chetan Chauhan on wide range of issues including the US's failure on this front.\u000a\u000aWho do you blame for the failure of Copenhagen climate conference?\u000a\u000aIt was a collective failure on part of the global leaders. For me, the biggest disappointment was my own country (United States). Had they passed the climate legislation, the end result of Copenhagen climate conference could have been different. There would have been dramatic chances of success of the summit. I wouldn't like to single out the villain.\u000a\u000aWhat is the reason that US has failed to pass the law even after Copenhagen?\u000a\u000aA strong lobby serving particular interests. It was an important policy challenge. The House of Representatives passed the law but the government failed to get it through the senate. It was a big setback.\u000a\u000aWhat is the way to get US climate law back on track?\u000a\u000aWe all will have to redouble our efforts. We will have to build strong grass root support to overcome opposition to the climate law by special interest groups. People will have to be made more aware about the dangerous impact of climate change and their voice can bring about the change at the policy level.\u000a\u000aYou have spoken about a price on carbon to fight climate change. Can you elaborate?\u000a\u000aThere are several options available. One can be carbon tax and another incentive to cap carbon emissions. It should be a democratic process in which the market forces will have to play an important role. It is all about demand and supply. We will have to think about consequences on earth and the solution is not possible without involving the market. They have to be a part of the solution.\u000a\u000aThere has been a lot of talk about the numerous impact of climate change. But not much has been done on adaptation. Do you agree that the rich countries have not provided much of the funds to help poorer nations to adapt to combat the consequences?\u000a\u000aAdaptation has been an important part of climate solution. Since the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, the accepted formula has been assistance by wealthier nations to the poor. It meant financial pledges made by rich countries to help the poor. I don\u2019t know whether the actual aid was less than what had been pledged. To me, it was one of the objectives of the Copenhagen climate summit. Some commitments were made and it is time to follow them up at next summit in Cancun. The need for adaptation is growing as evident from recent floods in Pakistan or drought in Russia and its cost is also growing.\u000a\u000aWhat is your message for Cancun climate summit?\u000a\u000aThere should be meaningful progress on several issues including forestry and finance mechanism for adaptation as I referred earlier.\u000a\u000aHow can individuals contribute to fight the climate change?\u000a\u000aSome sensible choices like using more energy efficient light bulbs, more insulation and adopting less carbon consuming technologies can help. But, the bigger change will come at the policy level by the politicians. Leaders will have to become political activists and go at the grass root levels to speed up the process of fighting global warming.

a((V‘We need to find a common ground with developing countries on climate change mitigation. This could be possible in Cancun’\u000a\u000aAhead of the next round of climate change negotiations at Cancun,Artur Runge-Metzger,Director,International and Climate Strategy for the European Union,spoke to Shalini Nair in Brussels about the trajectory of climate change,the prospects for Cancun and the sticky issues of technology sharing and legally binding emission targets. Excerpts from the interview:\u000a\u000aThis year we have seen an unprecedented heat wave in Russia and devastating floods in Pakistan. Do these have a definite link with global warming and if yes,is there a need to reset our emissions reduction targets?\u000a\u000aAs scientists would tell you,it’s always hard to establish a link between a single weather event and climate change. On the other hand,science also tells us if climate change continues,such events will become frequent. The last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report makes it clear that there is an urgency to act and you see that reflected in terms of what happened last year in the Copenhagen climate summit. It was the first time that almost 120 heads of state and government were attending a climate conference—proof that there is awareness at the highest political level to deal with the problem.\u000a\u000aIn comparison to the hoopla that surrounded the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen,the run-up to the next UNFCCC at Cancun this year has been subdued. Is it expected to deliver on some of the gaping questions that Copenhagen left unanswered?\u000a\u000aWhat we saw in Copenhagen was a little wake-up call which showed how far we are still apart on climate change and many things need to be discussed in detail. Then,last year in Copenhagen there was an expectation that the US would pass its climate change legislation. This year we know it is not going to happen. There is willingness from the side of the Obama administration but the political situation in the US is very difficult to get any climate change legislation passed. That is a setback internationally. Many countries will start hiding behind the US and say if a country as rich as US cannot act on climate then why should we when we have not created this problem.\u000a\u000aWhich is not totally unjustified—the average per capita emissions in industrialised countries are ten times more than the average in developing countries. Why then should the BRIC economies (Brazil,Russia,India and China) take on this additional burden of combating climate change when they are not much responsible for it in the first place?\u000a\u000aIf you look at these two groups —the fast-growing developing countries and the developed ones who have established their infrastructure—the former provides maximum opportunities for making savings on emissions. As lot of investment is made in long-term infrastructure—energy,bridges,roads,or transport,it is easier and less expensive to make changes. The rich countries have to support the poorer ones in making the jump to cleaner technologies and in the process both groups are going to save money. That is what we are trying to enshrine in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Of course,richer countries like Europe have an obligation to employ the cleanest technologies and that is the reason we put in place the Emissions Trading System (ETS). Under ETS,when you put a limit on the tonnes of CO2,the power sector is allowed to emit and say the emissions should decline over time,they know it is going to get more expensive over time to emit,making it obligatory for them to move into the low-carbon economy.\u000a\u000aIndia has always quoted its development backlog as the reason not to have legally binding emissions reduction targets. How can India be part of climate action without compromising on its growth story?\u000a\u000aWe believe no country will have to compromise on its growth story while tackling climate change. It’s a different development pattern you will have to follow; it’s a cleaner technology you will have to employ. The immediate extra bill you will have to pay for that is in the end compensated by the bill you will not have to pay for adaption costs. If you look at the carbon footprint of an individual rich person in India and in Europe,the difference is not that big. It’s a matter of the consumption pattern of the rich: is it a fuel efficient car you are driving,it is a matter of how do you heat or cool your house? We need to establish a way of investing in cleaner technologies and some collaboration is required between industrialised and developing countries in making the necessary leap forward. We hope both India and China will compromise with us on the issue of monitoring,reporting and verification of climate change mitigation. We need to find a common ground in order to take this process forward and I think that this could be possible in Cancun soon.

a((VForum for change: Al Gore says there is no other forum besides the United Nations within which to arrive at a global solution to climate change. Vijay Verma / PTI\u000a\u000aUpdated: Sun, Nov 21 2010. 10 44 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: Former US vice-president Al Gore, who is now a global campaigner for action against climate change, was in New Delhi to participate in the two-day Hindustan Times Leadership Summit that ended on Saturday. In an interview, he says that many US states and cities are moving on their own to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but more is expected of the US federal government. He also agrees there is growing global appreciation of India\u2019s role in multilateral negotiations on climate change and trade. Edited excerpts:\u000a\u000aDo you think the US has abdicated its leadership role in battling climate change?\u000a\u000aFor those who expected the US to play a more active leadership role at Copenhagen, it was certainly a disappointment that the US Senate did not pass legislation. But the glass was half full in the sense that the US House of Representatives did pass the legislation and President (Barack) Obama is very much in favour of it, and the Environmental Protection Agency is proceeding even without legislation to regulate the reduction of CO2 emissions. Two-thirds of American people support moving forward on the issue. Many states and cities are moving ahead on their own. There is progress alongside disappointment. But clearly, there was more required than ended up being done. But the work is still under way and I am optimistic that the US will rise to the challenge.\u000a\u000aThe Chicago climate exchange has just closed down. What is the sentiment in the industry on carbon pricing? How will they be made to pay?\u000a\u000aForum for change: Al Gore says there is no other forum besides the United Nations within which to arrive at a global solution to climate change. Vijay Verma / PTI Yes, that is why we need more laws and policies and ultimately a global treaty. Some nations are already pricing carbon. They see it fit in their own self-interest. But simply relying on voluntary measures is insufficient because the power of the markets is so enormous. It has to be integrated into the routine decisions in the marketplace. But because it embodies such a big change, there is great resistance to it. And carbon-intensive polluters, particularly coal and oil companies, have fiercely opposed these changes. But they have to come.\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Accord does not mention anything on burden sharing in terms of CO2 emission cuts. Does the US expect developing nations to lift an unfair burden in emission cuts?\u000a\u000aNo, not at all. The US has long accepted and recognized the principle of common but differentiated obligations. In addition to (a) per capita argument, there is also the historic contribution argument. But the essence of the challenge here, in equity terms, is that there are two competing realities, which are both valid. On the one hand, the wealthy countries have historically contributed more to the problem and higher per capita emissions, but China is the largest polluter overall and is still increasing rapidly. Also, the developing countries as a group surpassed the developed countries (in emissions). So we have to acknowledge and incorporate both of these as well as per capita emissions. But the way to reconcile these two competing realities is with assistance from wealthy countries to developing countries. Many promises have been made and fewer have been redeemed. But in order to get an agreement, we have to make good on those promises.\u000a\u000aIf nothing is delivered at the Cancun climate meeting, would you say that everybody will lose trust in the UN process and it will be the end?\u000a\u000aI doubt that will happen. It is a danger. But I doubt that will happen because the problem is not going away. If the politicians fail, the problem is still there. It is getting worse and we have to face up to it. And there is no other forum besides the UN (United Nations) within which to arrive at a global solution. Now it does look challenging at this point, I acknowledge that. And some have argued that bilateral and regional approaches might get us closer to where we need to be. But ultimately, there must be a global agreement. And the only way to get there is to build grassroots awareness, support and sense of urgency to the point where politicians feel the pressure from the people to do the right thing.\u000a\u000aBut polls in the US are saying that interest in the US on climate change is decreasing.\u000a\u000aI am not sure that is true. I know the polls that you are citing, but I mentioned it in my remarks (that) virtually all the change has been in one political party. And it has come about largely because the leaders of that party and some of their communication organizations have really driven the point of view that there is no such thing as the climate crisis. That conflicts so directly with the reality that it is only a matter of time before that illusion collapses.\u000a\u000aDoes your domestic policy imperatives impede serious policy initiatives, particularly on environment?\u000a\u000aIt makes them more difficult, yes. But this is hardly the first time there has been public anger and difficulties in the period of transition, but it does make it more challenging. The recent (mid-term) elections make it more challenging. But elections come and they go. Two years ago, (the) US turned one way, and two years later another way. Maybe two years from now, it will turn back. And this should not be a partisan issue. It should be a point of view adopted by all political parties.\u000a\u000aIndian politicians say the world\u2019s perception of India has changed from that of a spoiler to a proactive player in multilateral negotiations on climate change and trade. Do you agree?\u000a\u000aOh yes, definitely. PM (Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh is tremendously respected and I think the Indian political system generally. I think that India\u2019s perceived posture of leadership in the world is very different from the perception only a few years ago. Maybe the older perception was inaccurate. I don\u2019t know. But certainly, (the) perception today is India is providing its share of leadership with integrity and forthrightness. The world today understands the tremendous challenges India faces and respects the tremendous progress India is making. I think the general perception is dominated by optimism and hope.\u000a\u000aTime is of the essence in dealing with climate change, but the UN process is painfully slow. How do we resolve this contradiction?\u000a\u000aIf I felt that we could make more progress by focusing on regional and bilateral processes, then I would advocate that. But ultimately it has to be global. But (a) sense of urgency is very grave. Today, we will put another 90 million tonnes of global warming pollution into the atmosphere. Approximately 20% of what we put up there will be there a thousand years from today. We have already heated the atmosphere by one degree Celsius but we have heated the oceans another degree, which will then later heat the atmosphere even further. The longer we wait, the more damage is done and the longer lasting the damage will be and the transition will be that much more expensive. And yet, because there is this time lag in the re-emergence of the heat, we don\u2019t see with our eyes or feel with our senses the results of what we are doing today. CO2 is invisible, tasteless, odourless and has no price tag. So it is out of sight and out of mind even as it continues to build up the damage. Some people call it the problem from hell.

a((VNo doubt US President was in India on a business trip. His recent electoral losses weighed heavily on him when he stitched up deals, reportedly of some $10 billion, that would create about 50,000 jobs back home. In this transactional world of commerce, we can hardly ask why the president of the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful economy has been reduced to a mere commercial agent. But we can, and must, ask if the nature of the business he is offering is good for us, or even for him.\u000a\u000aLet us be clear. When President Obama came to power, he came on the promise of change. He assured his countrymen (and all of us in faraway lands who watched with equal excitement and expectation) that he would shake the country out of its corporate grip and would make a difference in the way America runs its economy. It was a crucial promise, made at a time when the business model his country had been exporting was revealing its nasty underbelly \u2014 from the subprime crisis in housing to greedy bankers.\u000a\u000aBut on this trip to India, the president was an agent of the same business model, which is not only bringing his country down economically, but also bringing the world to the precipice of a climate disaster. It is this consumption-based model of market economy that needs to be deciphered and rejected.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s look at the of what is at stake in the US-India trade relationship. American (A) priority is our agriculture \u2014 or (B) their biotechnology business. In recent years, there have been hectic parleys between top US companies like Monsanto and India\u2019s pliant and much-weakened agricultural science and policy establishment about greater access for business. Recently, the Rajasthan government has entered into memorandums of understanding with leading multinational biotech companies, including Monsanto, to do business in their products. It will put at their disposal agricultural universities and will assure public procurement of their seeds for distribution to farmers. This is all part of the package of the \u201cevergreen\u201d revolution President Obama spoke about on his trip.\u000a\u000aThe fact is that the agricultural model is failing even in his country because the cost of cultivation is high. It survives because of huge subsidies. It is fed huge amounts of chemicals, which, in turn, keep the country on a toxic treadmill and keeps costs of regulation high. Worse, it thrives on the promotion of industrial food, which is cheap and compromises on health. It is a model of agricultural growth and food that India cannot afford. We have huge numbers of people to feed, and we need affordable models of growing nutritionally good and environmentally sustainable food.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cC\u201d stands for climate change and the model of wealth that will cost us the world. Obama was wooing us because of our growing, consuming middle class. We are markets for goods and services his companies can provide. But this is again part of the problem.\u000a\u000aWe are markets, but not for the same rejected US-type wares that have spoiled the world\u2019s present and future. It is the Walmart style of retail business which is being offered to us today. It promises cheap goods, produced at considerable pain of child labour and discounted environmental standards in other parts of the world. As this model of growth does not build inclusive economies, where producers benefit from markets, it does not create wealth for all, or even employment for some. Just consider that this much-flaunted economic model cannot even provide adequate jobs for the small and insignificant population of the US. What will it do for a billion-strong country?\u000a\u000aThe \u201cD\u201d stands for the pharma or drug business, which is high on the India-US agenda today. The US wants us to behave \u201cresponsibly\u201d by taking patented drugs and growing its business of profit in human health. It has put us on its priority watch-list and is busy using every other trick to destroy the generic and affordable medicine business in India.\u000a\u000aThe question is whether this model of expensive health care is good for us. Remember, President Obama has faced his nemeses on the matter of health-care reform, where he was only trying to give more Americans access to medical care at affordable rates not determined by the greedy alliance between insurance and drug companies. Do we need this in India?\u000a\u000aThe \u201cE\u201d stands for the business of higher education. It will bring models of learning at costs we will not be able to afford. Worse, it will bring us the global teaching of solutions that is part of the problem and not the answer.\u000a\u000aWill President now live up to his promise of change? Or will he go down in history as just another petty salesman for bad ideas?

a((VIndia is confronted with the triple challenges of climate change, energy security and economic development with political will and technological prowess. But will that be enough to bring in the capital it needs to ensure a transition to green growth?\u000a\u000aIndia already has a head start in the race for renewables, ranking fifth in the world for installed clean energy capacity. Much of that capacity is wind power, but given India's climate, solar power could prove an even better opportunity. In 2009, the Centre launched an ambitious three-phase plan to generate 20 gw of solar power by 2022, up from just 17 mw today.\u000a\u000aBut the reality is that solar energy requires capital \u2014 a lot of it. While the feed-in tariffs for phase I are attractive, investors remain cautious in the wake of the global economic crisis and need more convincing of a potential project's viability. Unfortunately, globally, most solar capacity projects thus far have been small in scale and few in number, meaning that investors have too few precedents on which to assess risks and returns.\u000a\u000aThere are no tested financial instruments that can be "cut and pasted" for solar investments. Investors are also put off by the uncertainty or inconsistency of many governments' policies concerning emissions reduction, tariffs and incentives. In addition, even though solar technology has been around for decades, it is still an emerging technology: the industry is rife with numerous smaller players, technologies and standards.\u000a\u000aSo India will need to pave new ground if it wishes to rapidly scale up solar capacity. Nevertheless, India's targets are achievable, if the government pulls several levers at its disposal.\u000a\u000aEstablish a clear and consistent regulatory environment: Stable policies are critical to improve the predictability of projects, so that domestic and foreign banks and investors can gauge potential risks and returns. Investors need to be confident that regulation relating to the energy mix, emissions, or feed-in tariffs will be consistent and predictable. At the administrative level, enabling smoother processes for land applications, licences or access to existing infrastructure should be a priority. Two key issues here are clarity on the policy framework beyond 2013 and giving teeth to the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) mechanism.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

At every turn, water-filled pots seethe atop wood or charcoal stoves, throwing knots of steam into the air. These pots come in varying sizes; some hold just enough water to make three cups of tea, others can boil rice sufficient to feed 150 people.\u000a\u000aWatching over these stoves with a stopwatch in his hand is, quite often, Mouhsine Serrar, an animated Moroccan who has been living and working in Puducherry for nearly five years. In 2007, Serrar founded Prakti, one of the few dedicated stove research firms in the world\u2014so few, in fact, that \u201clast year, for some reason, we had 10 or 11 full-time staff\u201d, Serrar says with a laugh, \u201cand we became the biggest research firm in the world. It really doesn\u2019t take much\u201d.\u000a\u000aAs tiny as this industry is, it has one enormous ambition: To replace the developing world\u2019s traditional biomass stoves, used by roughly three billion people across the planet. The design of the basic mud chulhas found in Indian villages\u2014and their variants elsewhere in Asia, Africa and South America\u2014has persisted, with all its thermodynamic inefficiencies, for decades, and this constancy is proving destructive in multiple ways.\u000a\u000aStove experts such as Serrar tend to mention the suffering environment first. Every day, these stoves\u2019 three billion users burn 1kg of biomass apiece, releasing a total of 6 billion kg of carbon dioxide \u2014three times that released by all the private cars in the US daily, and thus a generous contributor to global warming.\u000a\u000aBut the stove can injure its user\u2019s health as much as the planet\u2019s. In a February 2008 paper, Esther Duflo and Michael Greenstone, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Poverty Action Lab, noted that \u201cwomen and children who congregate near cooking stoves are exposed to pollution levels unheard of in the developed world\u201d. This pollution consists of carbon monoxide, but also of minuscule particles of soot that can ignite virulent cases of lung disease.\u000a\u000aIn India, in the hot dome of space around a chulha, particulate matter concentrations can touch 20,000 micrograms per cu. m; the recommended limit is a mere 50. \u201cFor some of these women,\u201d Serrar says, \u201cit\u2019s like smoking several packets of cigarettes a day.\u201d Last year, a study published in The Lancet estimated that indoor air pollution\u2014the exhalations of chulhas\u2014causes 400,000 premature deaths every year in India.\u000a\u000aThis lethal double blow, to the environment and to public health, has suddenly elevated the profile of the humble stove. Last December, the ministry of new and renewable energy started a National Biomass Cookstove Initiative (NBCI), although little of note has progressed since. Two months ago, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, launched a Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, which plans to install 100 million clean stoves around the world.\u000a\u000aBut the economics of this crusade don\u2019t escape any of its participants. Crude village chulhas are popular precisely because they can be cobbled together for as little as Rs50, and because firewood and cow dung, though painstaking to collect, are readily available. \u201cWe\u2019re competing with chulhas that cost next to nothing,\u201d Serrar says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market out there, true, but it\u2019s very risky. You have to be either stupid or crazy to do stoves.\u201d\u000a\u000aA question of design\u2026\u000a\u000aPrakti\u2019s Candida Crasto operates a portable emission testing system. Hemant Mishra / Mint Serrar doesn\u2019t specify precisely which of those qualities led him, in 2003, to quit his job as a mechanical engineer in California and join Aprovecho Research Center, a non-profit stove lab that is the spiritual grandfather of every other research firm. After studying stoves at Aprovecho and working on projects in West Africa, Serrar arrived in India in 2005 to head up stove development under a Shell Foundation grant; he started Prakti, on his own dime, two years later.\u000a\u000aPrakti\u2019s facility is spread over a small, wooded plot of land. One large, jellybean-shaped room serves as an office space, while another room, a short walk away, is a functional workshop. The workshop is now dominated by a spectacular piece of apparatus, consisting of a large gas hood leading to a long tube that resembles the barrel of a bazooka.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a piece of equipment to measure the emissions from a stove,\u201d Serrar says. Nodding to Candida Crasto, a new Prakti employee, he goes on: \u201cCandida was coming here from the US, and she asked if I wanted anything from there. I told her this was the only thing I wanted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Crasto laughs. \u201cYou did.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe human race has been burning wood for so many centuries that it is tempting to think of combustion as a simple, easily perfected process. Rajendra Prasad, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-D) and a doyen of stove design, is even willing to identify a single key principle in combustion: \u201cIt\u2019s chiefly a question of air flow.\u201d The challenge\u2014as yet unmet, Prasad says\u2014is to craft a better stove without making it prohibitively expensive for the people who are its main users.\u000a\u000aMost traditional stoves are unable to allow in the precise volume of air to be efficient. Too little air produces thick smoke; too much air cools the flames. Their mud bodies can be awful insulators, haemorrhaging precious heat. These stoves thus devour far more fuel than necessary, and they are prodigious smoke producers to boot. They often don\u2019t have chimneys, and when they do, Serrar says, \u201cthe outlet is constricted. If there\u2019s a chimney, and if there\u2019s still smoke in the room, somebody has screwed up somewhere\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe effects of such stoves have transformed Govindammal\u2019s home, a hut in the village of Aanpakkam, near Puducherry. Her kitchen is a long, narrow space at the back of the house, and the mud stove she used till recently blackened the roof\u2019s rafters and the wall on which a poster of Sivaji Ganesan is pasted. Every evening, when Govindammal started making dinner, her husband Koneri says, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t stop coughing, because smoke would pour even into every room. The children couldn\u2019t study\u2014the smoke was that thick\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe Prakti stove that Govindammal bought in February\u2014one of around 7,000 that Prakti has sold since it went to market late last year\u2014is a blue two-pot model named Leo. Its mantle of sooty tarnish shows how avidly it has been used. The stove cost Govindammal Rs1,500\u2014as compared with Rs1,000 for a single-pot model\u2014and she bought it out of her savings in a local self-help group. \u201cI\u2019d need five or six bundles of firewood a day with the old stove, which I\u2019d collect on my way home from the fields,\u201d Govindammal says. \u201cNow I need two, maybe three bundles.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn parameters of efficiency, the Leo\u2014the newest of the seven stove models Prakti has developed over the years\u2014is promising. It halves the use of wood, and it reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 80% and particulate matter by 40%. Prakti\u2019s other stoves perform similarly well; 600 units of its biggest model have recently been purchased by the United Nations for use in Haiti, so brutally deforested a country that savings on wood go further there than elsewhere.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the Leo\u2019s stainless steel frame, its cast-iron grate, and its insulation of autoclave aerated cement come at a price. Manufacturing the double-pot stove can cost as much as Rs2,000 for small batches. The margin is slim, and well below industry standard; it can cover expenses, but not help recover research and tooling costs. We\u2019re learning that there\u2019s a ceiling for stoves\u2014around Rs1,000,\u201d Serrar says. \u201cThe thing is, in villages, the man of the household doesn\u2019t make the decision about a stove\u2014 the woman does. And the woman can\u2019t take a decision to spend that much on a stove.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2026and a question of price\u000a\u000aPhoto: Hemant Mishra / Mint Other stove firms have also run into intractable price issues. Envirofit India, a Bangalore-based company, was set up in 2008 by Envirofit International, an international non-profit. The firm started out selling a basic model\u2014looking very much like a black bucket with a hearth cut into it\u2014for Rs500, but P. Ravi Kumar, Envirofit\u2019s operations manager, says: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a sustainable price.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat base model now costs Rs899; a deluxe version, painted a vivid Cheetos orange, costs Rs1,499. The prices are difficult to drag down, in part, because Envirofit has its stoves designed in Colorado and made in China. Kumar insists this is unavoidable. \u201cWe use an alloy of chromium, aluminium and titanium, and we couldn\u2019t find an alloy manufacturer here,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, we use a particular refractory material, but again, we could find that in China but not India.\u201d\u000a\u000aEnvirofit now sells 8,500 stoves a month in the four southern states and Maharashtra. It sounds a respectable number, but Atul Joshi, senior manager for sales and marketing, estimates that they\u2019d need to sell a monthly 25,000 to start breaking even.\u000a\u000aPart of Envirofit\u2019s new strategy to hit that target involves ceasing to sell through NGOs and self-help groups\u2014as Serrar still does\u2014and moving away from the hoary rural marketing ideas they started with. \u201cIf we\u2019d continued selling from vans and doing road shows and street plays,\u201d Joshi says, \u201cmy next two generations would\u2019ve continued to struggle to build numbers.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor both Envirofit and Prakti, the richest mother-lode would be struck if their designs found favour with the NBCI, which could afford to somewhat subsidize the cost of these stoves and buy them in muscular numbers. But the NBCI hasn\u2019t yet decided how to price the stoves it will eventually distribute, says Prasad, who is a member of the project team.\u000a\u000aFrom 1983 to 1989, Prasad worked on another government stove campaign, and he has seen the disadvantages of giving away stoves for free or close to free. \u201cThe stove came with a cement pipe to be used as a chimney,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo people would come to get our free stoves just for the pipe, which they could then use as drainage pipes or for other purposes.\u201d That project ran until 2003, when it was shut down\u2014because, Prasad says cryptically, \u201cof poor feedback.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat previous project distributed 34 million stoves over its 20 years, either building them in situ with mud or, later, handing out spare iron frames on which a pot could rest. Results, Prasad admits, were mixed. \u201cThe emphasis at the time was on reducing wood consumption,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s only now that we\u2019re focusing on clean combustion. Also, if you get a measure of how many of those stoves survived\u2026well, for 34 million stoves, let\u2019s just say that the impact it could have made was not there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NBCI, Prasad says, will be design-neutral: It will test as many stove designs as possible and pick the best, irrespective of whether that has been designed by a company, a non-profit, or a government agency. But Prasad\u2019s own thoughts are revealing. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot to be learned from the chulha,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should be improving upon it, not necessarily building something entirely new.\u201d\u000a\u000aSerrar agrees with Prasad; in fact, a part of Prakti\u2019s work involves teaching artisans how to build wiser chulhas. \u201cBut you need the scientists. Sending bureaucrats and consultants to do this is like asking a butcher to design a wedding dress,\u201d Serrar says. \u201cDesigning a stove is hot, dirty work, and you need the geeks sitting in the labs, who are willing to get the wood, get down on their knees, and feed a fire. That\u2019s what you need.\u201d

a((VThe Global Carbon Project totalled the carbon emissions due to use of fossil fuels in power stations, cement manufacture and changes in land use, such as deforestation. File photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aGlobal emissions of carbon dioxide dropped by 1.3% in 2009 compared with the previous year, largely due to the effects of the economic crisis and an overall fall in GDP, according to an international team of scientists.\u000a\u000aThe drop is smaller than the 2.8% fall predicted by many experts for 2009, because the reductions in carbon emissions per unit of GDP \u2014 a measure of efficiency called the carbon intensity \u2014 was smaller than expected in many emerging economies.\u000a\u000aThe results are part of the annual carbon budget update by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), an international group of climate scientists and analysts that collates emissions data to help policy makers. The project totalled the carbon emissions due to use of fossil fuels in power stations, cement manufacture and changes in land use, such as deforestation.\u000a\u000aDespite the 1.3% overall drop, the 2009 global fossil fuel emissions \u2014 30.8bn tons of CO2 \u2014 were the second highest in human history, just below the all-time high of 2008.\u000a\u000aThe small overall decrease in global emissions masks some big regional shifts, according to the report published on Sunday in Nature Geoscience. As the global financial crisis has mainly affected developed nations, this is where emissions dropped by the largest amounts: in the U.S. by 6.9%, the U.K. by 8.6%, Germany by 7%, Japan by 11.8%, Russia by 8.4% and Australia by 0.4%.\u000a\u000aIn the emerging markets, however, there were big increases: China rose by 8%, India by 6.2% and South Korea by 1.4%.\u000a\u000aThe GCP also found that global CO2 emissions associated with deforestation have dropped by 25% since 2000 mainly due to a reduction in tropical deforestation.\u000a\u000a\u201cCO2 emissions from fossil fuels are projected to increase by more than 3% in 2010 if economic growth proceeds as expected, approaching the high emissions growth rates observed from 2000 to 2008,\u201d said Pep Canadell, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia and executive director of GCP.\u000a\u000aComputer models predict that if emissions continue to rise at the present rate, average temperatures are likely to increase by 4 degree Celsius by 2100.

a((VUS praises Indian role on climate change negotiations\u000a\u000aA top Obama administration official has praised India\u2019s role on climate change negotiations saying that the country,an important voice of the developing world,has shown both \u201ccommitment\u201d and \u201cwillingness\u201d to think in a new way and to be pragmatic.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an important voice on the developing country side. But I think India also has great potential to speak from a posture of credibility,frankly,on kind of both sides of the aisle,if you will,\u201d said Todd Stern,the Special US Envoy for Climate Change.\u000a\u000aStern was talking to foreign correspondents ahead of the United Nations Climate Change meeting at Cancun in Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia had a very important role last year in Copenhagen,and I think India will have a very important role this year,particularly if we have a chance of getting anywhere.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think India has shown both a commitment to principles but also a willingness to think in a new way and to be pragmatic. I think that\u2019s been quite important,\u201d Stern said in response to a question.\u000a\u000aThe challenge,he said,in Cancun is to find a way to build on the progress made last year in the Copenhagen Accord through the direct intervention of many of the world\u2019s leaders.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives from 194 nations will meet in the Mexican resort city of Cancun from November 29 to December 10 to clinch an agreement to curb greenhouse gases after 2012.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though it fell short of what many had hoped for,the accord took an important step forward in addressing climate change. Progress was made on all the key elements of the negotiations,and much of it in direct,face-to-face discussions among our leaders,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn essence,the accord included,on the one hand,landmark provisions for financing in order to support mitigation,adaptation,technology,and forest preservation \u2013 the so-called red issue \u2013 all of these things redounding to the benefit of developing countries that on the one hand,and on the other hand,a crucial agreement among both developed and developing countries to implement a set of mitigation either targets or actions,and to do so in an internationally transparent manner,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we are seeking now in Cancun is a balanced package of decisions on these points,decisions being a term of art in the framework convention.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is now widely understood that a legal treaty this year is not in the cards. There is broad convergence on the notion that a package of decisions is desirable and the devil will most certainly be in the details. To preserve the balance of the package in Cancun,we need to make comparable progress on all the core issues included in the accord,\u201d said the US official.\u000a\u000aStern said there is a vision of progress within the reach that would start with first a set of solid decisions this year that includes an adequate level of detail on each of the core issues \u2013 mitigation commitments,a green fund,transparency,technology,and so forth.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecond,followed by a concentrated follow-on process for 2011,such as special working committees in which the remaining detail on all of these issues would be elaborated.\u000a\u000aAnd then this process would conclude with the third step,which would be fully operational decisions,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cNone of this would preclude or prejudge an eventual legal treaty when the time is right,but our view is that we should be making concrete progress now.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the often repeated view of the United States,a treaty requiring legally binding mitigation commitments from the US,the EU,Australia,Japan,other developed countries; would have to also require them of China,India,and other emerging economies,and we just don\u2019t see this happening soon,\u201d Stern said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo rather than insisting on a legal treaty before anything happens,we should move down the pragmatic path of concrete operational decisions. And again,if we do this right,we can,in relatively short order,start standing up a green fund,create a new technology mechanism,start implementing significant mitigation commitments,put in place a system of transparency and accountability,and make real progress on adaptation and forest protection,\u201d he said.

a((VThe impact of rise in sea level due to climate change on coastal infrastructure like ports could turn out to be a huge economic loss to the countrys exchequer, said Sujatha Byravan, co-research author, Centre for Development Finance (CDF), IFMR, while releasing a report on Sea Level Rise: Impact on Major Infrastructure, Ecosystems and Land. The report was co-authored by Sudhir Chella Rajan, Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras, Rajesh Rangarajan and Sujatha Byravan from CDF, IFMR.\u000a\u000aWith the planned investment of approximately Rs 91,000 crore under National Maritime Development Programme(NMDP) to spruce up 12 major ports and 187 minor ports in the country, Byravan said the sea level rise due to climate change would cause enormous damage to ports due to severe cyclone, saltwater intrusion and wetland loss if adequate coastal conservation measures are not put in place.\u000a\u000aThe ports in high risk zones that could sustain relatively greater damage are in vulnerable locations of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal on the east and Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast. In case of Mumbai there is a greater need to strengthen the coastal basin to prevent the city from adverse climate change, she said. With the long coastal line of 7,517 kms in South Asia, the Indian peninsula needs urgent coastal protection measures to safeguard itself from potential human and habitat losses that are expected to occur due to climate change and consequent sea level rise, she added. Referring to the state of Tamil Nadu that recently got the nod for Rs 14,000 crore investment in Tutocorin and Ennore Ports development under NMDP, Byravan said the impact of sea-level rise in the state in terms of value of infrastructure including ports, powerplants and major roads are roughly estimated to be between Rs 47,418 crore and Rs 53,554 crore.\u000a\u000aOur appeal to the government, is to conduct vulnerability assessment and adopt findings of geomorphological studies in coastal development of various projects including ports, power projects and roads. For instance using Tamil Nadu as a case study that has about 1,076 km, with 13 coastal districts, the impact of total replacement cost of infrastructure projects like ports, roads and power plants due to sea level rise work out to Rs 61,15,471 crorea humongous sum on restoration when compared to the Rs 2,50,000 crore annual GDP of the state, she added.\u000a\u000aThe research author said the government should preserve wetland systems, provide assistance to at risk communities, set up early warning systems, plan for shoreline protection measures,etc.

a((VLONDON: A new study from the University of Exeter (UK) has said that global CO2 emissions may reach record levels in 2010.The authors found that global CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuel in 2009 were only 1.3 per cent below the record 2008 figures - less than half the drop predicted a year ago.The global financial crisis severely affected western economies, leading to large reductions in CO2 emissions. For example, UK emissions were 8.6 per cent lower in 2009 than in 2008. Similar figures apply to USA, Japan, France, Germany, and most other industrialised nations.But emerging economies had a strong economic performance despite the financial crisis, and recorded substantial increases in CO2 emissions."The 2009 drop in CO2 emissions is less than half that anticipated a year ago. This is because the drop in world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was less than anticipated and the carbon intensity of world GDP, which is the amount of CO2 released per unit of GDP, improved by only 0.7 per cent in 2009 - well below its long-term average of 1.7percent per year," Nature quoted Professor Pierre Friedlingstein as saying.Increased share of fossil-fuel CO2 emissions produced by emerging economies with a relatively high carbon intensity, and an increasing reliance on coal have failed to curb carbon intensity.And if the current trend continues, global fossil fuel emissions will increase by more than 3 percent in 2010, approaching the high emissions growth rates observed through 2000 to 2008.The study also found that global CO2 emissions from deforestation have decreased by over 25 percent since 2000 compared to the 1990s, mainly because of reduced CO2 emissions from tropical deforestation."For the first time, forest expansion in temperate latitudes has overcompensated deforestation emissions and caused a small net sink of CO2 outside the tropics", said Professor Corinne Le Quere, from the University of East Anglia and the British Antarctic Survey.The study is published in Nature Geoscience.

These incentives will coincide with trading in (RE) receipts on power exchanges, that will begin in the next couple of months.\u000a\u000aThe incentives for RE producers include exemption of customs duty on import of equipment for state electricity projects and relaxation of norms for grid access. The government has also specified terms for issue of RE receipts ( RECs) for promoting power generation using renewable sources.\u000a\u000aTrading in such receipts was officially set going by the (CERC) on energy exchanges last week. While trading will start in a couple of months, the exchanges have asked for registration of certificates duly accredited by states for registration, officials said.\u000a\u000aAn REC is a market-based instrument which would facilitate states and other consumers to comply with RE purchase obligations. Each state is now obligated to take a certain percentage of its total power requirement from renewable sources in the . If the demand for such receipts goes up, it can command better premiums, giving further incentives to generating companies.\u000a\u000aThis stipulation varies across places. For some like Delhi, which do not have access to readily, the norm is stipulated at five per cent. For Tamil Nadu, it is at 10 per cent, given its easier access to wind energy. For such states which do not have access, purchase of RECs would help in complying with the mandatory obligation, officials explained. Energy exchanges will facilitate such purchase and selling.\u000a\u000aWhile the will be the nodal agency for registration of RECs, the salient point in the recently finalised norms is the directive to NLDC by CERC for specifying floor and forbearance prices for trading of such receipts, officials said. They specified that this price band would help seller to avoid losses while trading.\u000a\u000aOther incentives\u000a\u000aCERC has relaxed its norms for grid connectivity for such renewable power projects, so as to expedite physical delivery of the commodity, RE, while redeeming such receipts.\u000a\u000aSaying it was a major liberalisation to boost renewable power projects, officials said the threshold capacity for connecting to the interstate grid had been slashed drastically, from 250 Mw for thermal power stations to 50 Mw for hydroelectric and other power generating stations, based on renewable sources. An electric grid is a central power system network that integrates transmission grids, distribution grids, distribution generators and loads across states. It is also specified that renewable power generating units with small capacity, even below 50 Mw, can approach the central transmission utility collectively, with an aggregate installed capacity of 50 Mw and above, for grid connectivity.\u000a\u000aImports of all items of machinery required for the initial setting up of a project for generation of power using non-conventional or renewable materials by state electricity boards are now exempt from customs duty. Only a five per cent ad valorem rate would be paid. State governments are also exempt from furnishing a valid power purchase agreement between importer and purchaser for a period not less than 10 years while availing of this tax benefit, otherwise a mandatory clause.

a((VIn the run up to the next global jamboree on climate change, in the tourism-cum-summitry town of Cancun, Mexico, the government has come out with an Indian view of global warming, based on indigenous research. The upshot of the effort is a much more worrisome portrayal of the challenge of The Indian studies forecast that mean temperature will rise in India by around 2ºC by 2030, rather than the 2050s as earlier projected by the UN panel on This is precisely the level at which the of last December binds countries to cap further increase in temperatures. Since no one country can by itself take measures that would save it from global warming, the Indian study adds to the global urgency for dealing with the challenge of It remains to be seen how seriously these new warnings will be regarded at Cancun, and indeed in India itself. While the international community must come forward with a meaningful strategy, there are things India can do on its own. To begin with, contain its emission of environment-injurious greenhouse gases and promote preparedness for adaptation to a changing environmental regime. The latter, perhaps, is more important than the former. This is evident from the sector-specific analysis presented in the official impact assessment report. It indicates that the sector will be the worst hit \u2014 with annual rainfall expected to increase, but with fewer rainy days. This will mean more floods and droughts. This clearly implies more trouble for India\u2019s farmers, who will be up against more erratic weather. Equally dreadful are the prospects of more frequent cloudbursts and floods which wreck misery and cause havoc.\u000a\u000aThe report has some bright spots of hope. It says the yields of irrigated rice and some plantation crops, notably coconut, are likely to increase. However, these gains are likely to be more than offset by the projected reduction in the productivity of several winter crops, including wheat and scarce pulses and oilseeds. Besides, the heightened vagaries of weather and recurring natural disasters will also take a heavy toll on crop yields, apart from lives and property. On the human health front, the report is unambiguous in stating that some of the dreaded vector-borne diseases, notably malaria, will become more prevalent and will spread to new areas like the Himalayan region.\u000a\u000aThe task ahead, therefore, seems daunting. However, it is reassuring that India already has a on Climate Change and public and political awareness of the challenge at hand is relatively high. Significantly, several of the eight \u201cnational missions\u201d that have been launched as part of the concern directly or indirectly with the sectors identified as vulnerable in this report. These are the missions on sustainable agriculture, water, and strategic knowledge. While these missions would, obviously, need further strengthening in the light of the latest report, the health concerns may require special attention. Getting climate change back onto the policy radar both nationally and globally is, therefore, a good thing and this report serves that purpose well.

a((VInvestors in green assets hope that upcoming UN climate talks in Mexico will salvage a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2011, and in the meantime widen and simplify existing carbon markets.\u000a\u000aThe UN process could boost the private sector if it builds trust in global climate action and so increases overall ambitions, such as to deploy renewable energy technologies.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations are supposed to agree in 2011 on a global successor to the Kyoto Protocol, whose present round expires in 2012.\u000a\u000aA Copenhagen summit last year failed to do that, and the focus now is on restoring momentum, especially for agreement next year in South Africa on new, more ambitious carbon caps.\u000a\u000aOne particular private sector focus at the November 29-December 10 talks in Cancun will be on the carbon markets.\u000a\u000aKyoto capped emissions by industrialised countries through 2012, driving them to invest in clean energy projects in developing countries to earn carbon tradable offsets, which would help them meet their limits.\u000a\u000aA commitment from Kyoto countries to extend the protocol for another period would prompt some positive (market) reactions, said Matteo Mazzoni, an analyst at Italys Nomisma Energia.\u000a\u000aWhile Cancun will not achieve a broad climate deal, rich countries may agree to insert their existing, national emissions targets to 2020 under an extended Kyoto Protocol in a wider deal to be finalised next year.\u000a\u000aBut that is an unlikely step, because it would hinge on similar agreement by China and the US.\u000a\u000aThe United States did not ratify the original protocol, which does not bind the emissions of developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe carbon market also wants progress on simpler rules governing trade in carbon offsets under the so-called clean development mechanism (CDM), worth about $20 billion last year.\u000a\u000aBusinesses as well as the governments largely accept that the UN process is the best way to drive action.\u000a\u000aWhats become clear this year is that theres no credible alternative. What the international process does is help build confidence, said Nick Robins at HSBC.\u000a\u000aCancun may deliver agreement on a deal to widen the CDM to include rainforests, which would allow investors to earn offsets from protecting forests, which store carbon in the trunks of trees and in the soil.\u000a\u000aBut some environmental groups are sceptical of progress on such a deal to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD), saying details are few and so any decision in Cancun would carry little weight.\u000a\u000aTheres no funding attached and details are up in the air, said Simon Counsell, director of the Rainforest Foundation UK.\u000a\u000aCounsell said REDD might become a bargaining chip in a wider deal, given that it could direct rich country funds to tropical nations, many of which are demanding that the US take a more ambitious stance in the overall talks.

a((VCompared with the extraordinary fanfare before the global-warming summit in Copenhagen a year ago, the meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that starts in Cancn next week has gone unheralded. That is partly because of a widespread belief that the publicity build-up to last years summit contributed to its failure, but also because expectations have changed dramatically. In the wake of the Copenhagen summit, there is a growing acceptance that the effort to avert serious climate change has run out of steam.\u000a\u000aPerhaps, after a period of respite and a few climatic disasters, it will get going again. It certainly should. But even if it does, the world is going to go on getting warmer for some time.\u000a\u000aAcceptance, however, does not mean inaction. Since the beginning of time, creatures have adapted to changes in their environment. Unfortunately, such adaptation has always meant large numbers of deaths. Evolution works that way. But humankind is luckier than most species. It has the advantage of being able to think ahead, and to prepare for the changes to come. Thats what needs to happen now.\u000a\u000aRussian summer\u000a\u000aEven if the currently moderate pace of emissions reduction steps up, the likelihood is that the Earth will be at least 3C warmer at the end of this century than it was at the start of the industrial revolution; less warming is possible, but so is more, and quicker. Heatwaves that now set records will become commonplace. Ecosystems will find themselves subject to climates far removed from those they evolved in, endangering many species. Rain will fall harder in the places where it falls today, increasing flooding; but in places already prone to drought things will by and large get drier, sometimes to the point of desertification. Ice will vanish from Arctic summers and some mountaintops, permafrost will become impermanent, sea levels will keep rising.\u000a\u000aThese changes will benefit some. As the melting ice allows access to the Arctic, Russia will become richer still in fossil fuels. For many, though, the prospects are grim. Drought and flood will put the livelihoods of hundreds of millions, mostly in developing countries, at risk. So the question is how to limit those risks.\u000a\u000aThose who can adapt will do so mostly through private decisions: by moving house, say, or planting different crops. But governments have a role too.\u000a\u000aThe best protection against global warming is global prosperity. Wealthier, healthier people are better able to deal with higher food prices, or invest in new farming techniques, or move to another city or country, than poor ones are. Richer economies rely less on agriculture, which is vulnerable to climatic change, and more on industry and services, which by and large are not. Richer people tend to work in air-conditioned buildings. Poor ones tend not to.\u000a\u000aBut development is hardly an easy solution to the problem. There are already plenty of good reasons for poor-country governments to put sensible economic policies in place, stop stealing money and do the manifold other things necessary to get their economies on the right track; and if they havent done those things already, the threat of climate change will not spur them into action. Climate change does, however, provide an extra reason for rich countrieswhich caused the problem in the first placeto find ways to help poor countries develop. That is a matter of justice, not just humanity.\u000a\u000aThere is another problem with relying on development: although it can help protect poor countries from climate change, it also threatens to make the problem worse, because as economies grow, they consume more and more energy. Here again, rich countries can help, by offering poor countries support for greener energy technologies, and thus allowing them to make use of their capacity for generating renewable energy from water, wind and sunlight.\u000a\u000aBeyond encouraging climate-friendly development, governments need to take some focused measures in three areas: infrastructure, migration and food. The Dutch, who have centuries of experience of protecting themselves against high water, are already working out how to adapt and build infrastructure to minimise the risks of flooding as sea levels rise and the rain-fed Rhine grows friskier. Elsewhere, politicians need to assess the vulnerability of their cities to changes in peak temperatures, in rainfall, in severe-storm frequency and in sea level, and act accordingly.\u000a\u000aAs life gets harder in vulnerable places, people will need to migrate both between and within countries. Rich people can help make life easier for poor ones by allowing larger numbers across their borders. Within rich countries, governments should stop subsidising insurance in vulnerable areassuch as the Florida coastlineand thus stimulating development there. People need to be encouraged to migrate away from vulnerable areas, not into them.\u000a\u000aGoing with the grain\u000a\u000aFood security will become a crucial issue. Drought-resistant seeds are needed; and, given that the farmers least able to pay will require the hardiest varieties, seed companies efforts should be supplemented by state-funded research. Since genetic modification would help with this, it would be handy if people abandoned their prejudice against it.\u000a\u000aEven with better crops, better soil conservation, better planting patterns and better weather forecasts, all of which are needed, there will still be regional calamities. To ensure that food is always available, the global food market will have to be deeper and more resilient than it is now. That means abandoning the protectionism that bedevils agriculture today.\u000a\u000aNone of this will make climate change all right. It remains the craziest experiment mankind has ever conducted. Maybe in the long run it will be brought under control. For the foreseeable future, though, the mercury will continue to rise, and the human race must live with the problem as best it can.\u000a\u000aThe Economist Newspaper Limited

a((VAs representatives from nearly 200 nations prepare to gather for United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Cancun this week, a central question looms: Can they achieve enough to keep the negotiations alive?\u000a\u000aNo one expects the two-week meeting, which begins on Monday, to produce a pact that would commit the nations of the world to curbing climate change. Such an agreement seemed possible a year ago, when the last round of negotiations concluded in Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aAt that session some of the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitters struck a deal: Industrialised nations would cut their emissions and by 2020 and would mobilise $100 billion a year in aid for the poorest countries suffering the effects of global warming; in exchange, major developing countries agreed to international scrutiny of their own emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aBut this agreement \u2013 the Copenhagen Accord \u2013 has come under fire over the past 12 months as the procedural bickering that has dominated negotiations for years has re-emerged. The collapse of domestic legislation in Congress, coupled with the recent election of dozens of lawmakers opposed to federal limits on greenhouse gases, have further undermined prospects for a meaningful deal.\u000a\u000aStill, those most invested in a global climate deal recognise that without some modest progress in Cancun \u2013 on issues such as preserving tropical forests, transferring clean technology to developing nations and establishing the framework for international climate aid \u2013 the process might collapse altogether. \u201cWe cannot afford any more failures,\u201d said Erik Solheim, Norway\u2019s minister for the environment and international development.\u000a\u000aFailure, however, remains a real possibility. For months negotiators have argued over whether to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which set binding targets for reducing emissions and whose first period is set to expire in 2012 \u2013 despite the US never ratifying the agreement, which imposes no emission cuts on greenhouse gas producers like China and India.\u000a\u000a(In an exclusive partnership with The Washington Post.

a((VCommentators will be forgiven for mixing their metaphors when it comes to Cancun, the coastal resort in Mexico. It is here that the second act of the tragedy \u2014 which began, with true Hamlet-like indecision, in Copenhagen exactly a year ago, will unfold. There was also an element of black humour when the impasse among the 190-odd countries was broken by President Barack Obama gatecrashing the midnight conclave that Basic countries \u2014 Brazil, South Africa, China and India \u2014 had summoned and brokered a so-called 'accord'.\u000a\u000aCancun may well be the night after, a long hangover which no amount of platitudes will cure. It is going to be a beach party where the elephant in the room, the US, isn't going to play a major role because President Obama is far too tangled with Congress to be able to push through a domestic cap-and-trade policy, let alone one on a global scale. The final denouement will be in South Africa in 2011.\u000a\u000aOnly last month, the president of the authoritative Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Eileen Claussen, former assistant secretary of state for international environmental affairs, made this clear. "Continued economic struggles and political changes expected after the US congressional elections are likely to make advancing climate policy an even tougher fight than we experienced over the last two years,\u201d she said. "I think I speak for most of those working on this issue in Washington when I say the chances of passing a major climate bill in the next two years are nearly zero.\u201d\u000a\u000aTodd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, and the most prominent actor in this tragedy, displays no such pessimism. Speaking at the University of Michigan, also in October, he asserted that US domestic politics was not a "stumbling block\u201d. Though the US has made way for China as the country with the most emissions \u2014 India now figures third, because of the recession in Russia, where industries and coal-powered power stations have been hit \u2014 the average American emits much more, with only a quarter of China's people.\u000a\u000aHe went on to make several assertions, each of which can be challenged. He wondered whether Copenhagen marked a new paradigm in climate diplomacy, which is shorthand for scuttling the protracted UN-led negotiations since the Kyoto Protocol came into force in 1997, but abhorred by the US (President Bush was allergic to it, as are most US politicians, Obama being no exception). Stern referred to a "Berlin wall\u201d between developed and developing countries which was fostered by the protocol.\u000a\u000aThis strikes at the heart of the debate on global warming. As enunciated most clearly on the global stage by none other than the late Anil Agarwal, founder of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi in 1991, industrial countries should not only pay for their current pollution, but are responsible for "historical emissions", referring to the build-up in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide that will last for generations, even if all industries throughout the world downed their shutters tomorrow.\u000a\u000aStern questioned the long-debated and widely accepted Kyoto mantra: that all countries had "common but differentiated responsibilities". As he put it, "Over time, many countries stretched this paradigm to say that developed countries have legally binding obligations, while developing countries are asked only to act voluntarily. But this claim has no textual support." How can he brazenly challenge what 191 countries have signed, and since its first phase ends in 2012, these countries have been doggedly negotiating the second.\u000a\u000aSecondly, he asserted that no deal which didn't include China and other "emerging markets" (note the term) was a non-starter. He ought to remember that while China emits 23 per cent of global greenhouse gases, the US emits 22 per cent. India is far lower, with only 5 per cent of emissions. The US is targeting China as the world's dirtiest country, claiming that it is the second largest historic emitter (after itself, presumably due to its huge population) and will in 2020 be emitting 60 per cent more than the US.\u000a\u000aIt is clear that it is a share of the atmospheric space which countries that have not industrialised \u2014 China is still predominantly rural and poor by any reckoning \u2014 are demanding. In India, 600 million people don't purchase any form of energy (including wood or coal), while 400 million don't have a bulb to switch on at night. While we figure third in the list in absolute terms, we are towards the bottom in per capita terms, which is surely the index to measure.\u000a\u000aThere ought to be, a la the Kyoto Protocol, differentiated liabilities. Industrial countries, following the lead of the EU which has unilaterally agreed to cut emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 \u2014 30 per cent if the US comes on board \u2014 have to agree to quantitative cuts, while developing countries have to reduce the energy intensity of their industries even as they move towards a reduction regime within a deadline. And despite the OECD countries' own commitments to provide $30 billion till 2012 to most vulnerable countries, only $3 billion has been coughed up. Will we ever see that $100 billion a year from 2020 that Obama and others have promised?\u000a\u000aDarryl D'Monte is chairman, Forum of Environmental Journalists of India.

a((VNEW DELHI: Despite Mexico's promise not to do a Copenhagen on the climate talks which begins in Cancun on November 29 -- a bid to override the hardnosed but protracted climate negotiations with a super-imposed political summit of heads of states -- it may just end up doing that.Sources in the government said, PM Manmohan Singh had received a last-minute invite for a heads of state summit planned in the second half of the UN climate negotiations in Cancun on December 9. The PM will not be able to attend the summit since he would be preoccupied with the Indo-EU summit.But the plan to highjack the actual UN negotiations, where every word is debated tediously, by bringing in heads of states to come up with a last- minute half-deal, which could also be a face-saver for host Mexico, has not gone down well with India.The sudden attempt to set up a high-level summit, which technically is not a part of the UN negotiations, is being seen in Indian quarters as a way to gloss over the persisting differences between the developed and developing countries -- with a political statement being bandied out at the last moment. The chance of such a statement emerging despite substantial differences always remains high. Besides, there is a growing pressure on the heads of states to show off something `substantial' emanating from their gathering.The bad odour of Copenhagen talks, where the developed countries blocked talks at the negotiating level while the Danish government tried to broker an accord without reference to the UN principles had created an atmosphere of distrust between the two blocks that is yet to fade away.The Copenhagen talks had witnessed an unprecedented scene --- with various heads of states personally negotiating over phrases and words of the accord --that finally got brokered.So far, Mexico has been trying hard to keep different country and groupings on board with informal talks as well as `pre-COP' meeting that was held as a run-up to the November 29 meet.With everyone agreeing that the 193 countries, who are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, would not be able to conclude a complete deal by Cancun, the hosts had instead suggested a Copenhagen Accord style `Cancun Mandate' that most countries have rejected.It had been decided that even if a few decisions -- such as setting up the principles and direction for next years negotiations -- were to be finalised they should arise out of the text being negotiated in the first week of the talks when only bureaucrats and diplomats engage.Neighbouring country heads are expected to turn up at Cancun and the US, too, could parachute in a high -rofile character at the last moment just as Hillary Clinton flew into Copenhagen with a promise of $100 billion every year by 2020 for developing world. But an orchestrated high-level summit of heads of states was not on the table till a couple of days ago.Even the few decisions laying out principles have got stuck in the informal talks with developing countries in the G-77 block insisting that there be a `balanced outcome', where all the building blocks of a complete deal see some progress and detailing and not just those in favour of the developed world.

It will also seek to formalize existing targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aFanfare is far below levels of last year's Copenhagen summit which aimed to agree a new climate deal but ended instead with a non-binding agreement rejected by a clutch of developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe long-running UN talks have pitted against each other the world's top two emitters, the United States and China, with U.S. demands for greater Chinese emissions curbs echoing similar pressure on free trade and human rights.\u000a\u000aOn the eve of the talks, Mexican President Felipe Calderon pointed to the economic opportunities from fighting climate change, aiming to end the distrust of the previous summit.\u000a\u000aThis dilemma between protecting the environment and fighting poverty, between combating climate change and economic growth is a false dilemma, he said pointing to renewable energy as he inaugurated a wind turbine to power the conference hotel.\u000a\u000aCalderon said the talks would focus on preparations for a hotter world, a central concern for poorer countries.

a((VAs the curtain rises in Cancún, Mexico, on the next round of international talks on climate change, expectations are low that the delegates will agree on a new treaty to reduce emissions. They were unable to do so last year in Copenhagen, and since then the negotiating positions of the biggest countries have grown even further apart.\u000a\u000aYet it is still possible to make significant progress. To give these talks their best chance, the delegates in Cancún should move beyond their focus on long-term efforts to stop warming and take a few immediate, practical actions that could have a tangible effect.\u000a\u000aThe opportunity to make progress arises from the fact that global warming is caused by two separate types of pollution. One is the long-term buildup of carbon dioxide, which can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. Diplomacy has understandably focused on this problem because, without deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, there can be no permanent solution to warming.\u000a\u000aThe carbon dioxide problem is hard to fix, however, because it comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, so essential to modern life and commerce. It will take decades and trillions of dollars to convert all the world's fossil-fuel-based energy systems to cleaner systems like nuclear, solar and wind power. In the meantime, a fast-action plan is needed.\u000a\u000aBut carbon dioxide is not the only kind of pollution that contributes to global warming. Other potent warming agents include three short-lived gases \u2014 methane, some hydrofluorocarbons and lower atmospheric ozone- and dark soot particles. The warming effect of these pollutants, which stay in the atmosphere for several days to about a decade, is already about 80 per cent of the amount that carbon dioxide causes. The world could easily reduce these pollutants; the technology and regulatory systems needed to do so are already in place.Big cuts are also possible in hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, many of which are used as refrigerants in air-conditioners and other cooling systems.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ The taper tigers\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen set a target of achieving a binding treaty and it did not happen. Now the sights are set on a smaller, though just as important, issues.\u000a\u000aSaleemul Haq, senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in London, says there are two broad camps. One is the extremists or absolutists, the all or nothing group. The second group is more pragmatic; it looks to the \u201cdoable\u201d and there could be some progress here.\u000a\u000aA positive outcome\u000a\u000aIn terms of negotiations, the Copenhagen conference was close to an agreement on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) plus, adaptation and technology transfer, but the only question was how much money was available or would be given by the developed countries. A positive outcome was that for the first time, $30 billion was promised as fast start climate finance over the next three years. However, this offer was made so late that it was simply not enough to overcome the negative momentum last year.\u000a\u000aAccording to an IIED study, of the $30 billion, only $3 billion was meant for adaptation, which was not balanced at all. Adaptation funding was under-exploited by countries. The other issue was the channel of funding. Every developed country wanted its aid agencies or banks to route the money while the developing world wanted it through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000aA few countries like Spain have pledged \u20ac40 million to the UNFCCC.\u000a\u000aCancun is all about money, according to Dr. Haq. He said the promised Green Fund could materialise sooner or later. The U.S. had a strong preference for routing funds outside the UNFCCC. The developed nations had a mental frame for assistance \u2014 it was a paradigm of charity still. However, it was important to understand that this was an agreement where the recipients had a say and it was not charity, he pointed out. For instance, Norway had given $5.4 billion. The French were giving loans for the fast start period of three years. With the promise of more finance after 2012, the Green Fund could be a reality.\u000a\u000aHowever the danger in not having a binding treaty was that matters could be accomplished outside the U.N. framework. The \u2018polluter pays' principle enunciated in the UNFCCC clearly put the onus on the polluter. It was not a charity at all. The problem was serious enough to warrant payment.\u000a\u000aMatters were in an incremental phase, he explained, and the time for a \u201cbig bang\u201d would come five years later when the fifth assessment report by the UNFCC would be out. China, which was heavily investing in new technologies, was looking to a post-carbon phase and it could lead the way five years from now, he predicted.\u000a\u000aHowever, Dr. Haq was clear that even if climate change negotiations went out of the purview of the U.N. to the G-20 level as was widely expected, the UNFCCC could not be killed. Even in the G-20, environment agreements dominated and energy agreements were related to climate change measures. But such unilateral actions could not curb temperatures increase to below 2 degrees Celsius as committed by the industrialised countries. Any hope of binding emission cuts was dim with the resurgence of Republicans in the U.S. and climate change deniers.\u000a\u000aIn the third world, climate change was accepted as a reality. China had also realised that the fossil fuel era was over and it was making a transition to cleaner technologies. Maldives, though a small country would be carbon neutral in 10 years, he said.\u000a\u000aOther sources closely tracking the negotiations say that a Green Fund is a possibility here. So was a Cancun Mandate of sorts that would determine the outcome of the groups working to meaningfully negotiate the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol. It will take some lengthy negotiation to convert the delicate portions of the Kyoto Protocol into a long term binding commitment.\u000a\u000aCopenhagen is a lesson that smaller agreements are possible if one did not aim big. It remains to be seen if that lesson has been learnt a year later.

a((VIndia aims at bringing United States back on board at Cancun climate talks but has termed its offer on climate mitigation as \u201chomeopathetic\u201d.\u000a\u000aTo clinch US, India has two proposals. First, which appeals to the United States, is on measurement review and verification (MRV) regime. India has proposed that nations, whose emissions are one% or more of the global average, should allow verification of their domestic mitigation commitments through a United Nations process.\u000a\u000aUS has been seeking verification of climate commitments of major emitters like China to agree to any climate treaty and India\u2019s proposal ensures that. Brazil, India\u2019s partner in global talks, has opposed the move.\u000a\u000aThe second plan is setting up a global network of climate innovations centres on pattern of Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil US agrees there is no use of climate talks,\u201d environment minister Jairam Ramesh said, at a Center for Science and Environment function.\u000a\u000aRamesh believes the US offer of reducing emissions by 14% by 2020 to its 2005 level, which is zero as compared to 1990 level, was \u201cpathetic\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is like a homeopathic treatment and is homeopathetic,\u201d he said, while expecting that Cancun will help in building foundation for climate talks.\u000a\u000aThe biggest bottleneck for Cancun is failure of the rich nations to deliver $30 billion as committed in Copenhagen a year ago. There is clarity only on $seven billion, of which $four billion is being provided for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.\u000a\u000aThe US, which announced $100 billion, has provided only $1.8 billion, of which $400 million is as export credit. \u201cThe fast track finance being provided is bizarre,\u201d Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aFor Cancun, it would mean further dent in the \u201ctrust deficit\u201d with the developing world losing faith on the developed nations for its failure to meet its finance commitment.\u000a\u000aAround 70% of 193 nations need money to adapt for climate change implications. In all this, Mexico is floating an idea of Cancun mandate, aimed at legitimising the Copenhagen accord, initially between US and few rich countries.

a((VApplied Materials is the biggest products and services supplier to manufacturers of semiconductors, flat panel displays and solar photo voltaic products all over the world. In India, the company is led by president & managing director. In a meeting and email interview with FEs, he spoke about the role of the semiconductor industry in helping achieve the national solar mission target. Excerpts:\u000a\u000aWhat are the implications of the national thrust on solar energy for the semiconductor industry\u000a\u000aSince a solar cell is nothing but one of the simpler semiconductor devices, it means that the semiconductor industry too stands to gain from the thrust on the solar industry in terms of the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem.\u000a\u000aAnd what does it mean for Applied Materials\u000a\u000aIf we look at just one aspect of the solar mission guidelines, there is a focus on domestic content. The solar modules used this year will have to be manufactured in India. Next year, in addition to solar modules, even solar cells used will have to be manufactured in India. To make these cells, equipment are needed, and we are equipment providers. That's where we come in.\u000a\u000aBut the stipulation about the domestic content is for only the first phase of the solar mission. Isnt that too short a period for the domestic industry to make investment\u000a\u000aFrom the governments perspective, one of the aims of focusing on the domestic content is to ensure that hi-tech manufacturing capacity is set up in India. If it were not done, hi-tech manufacturing would never take off in India. Once you set up infrastructure for hi-tech manufacturing, then it will trigger more manufacturing, and also enable related industries like LED and flat panel display manufacturing.\u000a\u000aRight now, the target for the first year is split equally between solar photo voltaic (PV) and solar thermal. Worldwide, including in India, PV is the most deployed technology. Since you operate in the PV domain, don't you feel splitting the target equally limits you\u000a\u000aThe pie is too big for all of us. It would be fantastic if bothsolar photo voltaic and solar thermalwere to install their share of the phase-1 target. With time, the progress shown by solar PV or solar thermal developers will be monitored, and suitable re-allocation might be done, if needed. The overall target is challenging, but its achievable.\u000a\u000aBut achieving the solar mission target requires much more. Do we have an ecosystemof manufacturing, R&D, standards, financing, marketing, and serviceto achieve this ambitious target\u000a\u000aSome aspects are reasonably in place. Let us look at each one of them. a) Manufacturing: there are already quite a few players in cell manufacturing; b) R&D/human resources: there are many groups in academia carrying out research in devices, materials and processes; c) Standards/quality: the government is enabling a lot on this front; d) Financing: it is a big stumbling block because you require a lot of upfront capital. Financing is not yet that mature for the solar industry in India; e) Marketing & acceptance: the awareness about the solar technology and its advantages has not yet reached the masses; f) Maintenance & service: this has been almost non-existent, but with the growth of industry we should see an improvement.\u000a\u000aThe government is offering a bouquet of incentives. But the solar industry is facing a tough time in countries like Spain, even with incentives. Going forward, what is the learning for India\u000a\u000aSpain opened its door too much too soon, and found it difficult to sustain the incentives. This resulted in reducing the capacity targets, as well as the feed-in-tariffs. Germany went about it more slowly, set up the infrastructure, and also enabled roof-top installations and feeding into the grid. Though it is also reducing feed-in-tariffs year-on-year, it is natural since the cost of cells and systems is steadily decreasing.\u000a\u000aIf we can learn from them, are clear about our vision, and focus on the important aspects of the ecosystemwe can be a world leader in market, technology, business, and manpower in the solar industry.

a((VPrivate Equity\u000a\u000aEarly this week, when renewable energy company Auro Mira Energy raised $21 million from a clutch of private equity investors, founder N Srinivasan pegged the market opportunity for his young company as \u2018enormous\u2019, in light of what he termed the \u201cexploding opportunity in renewable energy\u201d.More entrepreneurs across the country are buying into this point of view, as they set up start-up enterprises in areas such as solar energy development, waste management, LEDs, biofuels and diversified clean energy . Green is in, as the country grapples with multiple issues from crippling power deficiency to high pollution levels.\u201cAt a time when the domestic economy is poised to grow at 8.5% and the government is focusing on financial inclusion, renewable energy offers enormous potential to bridge India\u2019s energy demand-supply gap, which would be required to maintain this projected economic growth,\u201d said Pankaj Sehgal, managing director at SUN Group , a private equity firm. \u201cAlmost half of India\u2019s 1.2 billion people have no access to grid or power supply. Of the 160, 000 mw of power generated in the country, about 18-20% is lost due to inefficient grid and power distribution infrastructure,\u201d he added.Much effort to drive a green agenda in the country is also coming from the government, which is planning to make it mandatory for firms to disclose \u201cgreen initiatives\u201d in their annual reports. Salman Khurshid, minister of corporate affairs, had said earlier this year that companies may be asked to account details on measures taken by them to move towards green technology in their annual reports.This slew of preferential fiscal and regulatory incentives from the government, besides the rising concerns around energy security, is prompting growth in the sector, says Vinod Kala, founder and CEO of Emergent Ventures, a global consulting and finance firm focused on providing services to mitigate climate change.\u201cHigh availability of resources, especially in waste management, and the macro-level investment buzz around the sector are some of the key factors that are driving significant entrepreneurial interest,\u201d he adds. Established in 2004 to support the development of clean development mechanism projects in the carbon market, the firm specialises in areas of wind, biomass gas, biomass combustion, solar and waste management. The company is backed by IDFCApart from the economic and policy factors driving interest in clean technology, opportunity for new business is also coming up, to meet growing consumer demand for more planet-friendly services and products.\u201cPeople are willing to pay a premium for green services now,\u201d says Akshat Rathee, MD at Earth-100 Biofuels, a start-up company that provides corporate customers with a fleet of vehicles that run entirely on biodiesel. Established in 2007, the Gurgaon-based firm today provides an integrated solution including cars modified to run on 100% biodiesel that helps bring down carbon footprint.It also offers add-on services such as convenient dispensing locations, service and maintenance support and performance tracking. The firm is currently supported by Jindal Power as an investor, while Mahindra plays a critical role as technology partner. It has a signed order book of 40 cars, and is negotiating for another 30, said Mr Rathee, who is looking for fresh investments to expand the fleet of cars and to set up back end operations.Total investment in the clean-tech space in the year 2009 stood at $2.7 billion, while the sector attracted investments worth $162 billion globally, as per estimates of New Energy Finance, an information service for the clean technology industry. \u201cWe have identified several companies that we want to fund over the coming months,\u201d said Mr Sehgal of SUN Group, who has been looking at the investment opportunity in the Indian clean-tech sector since 2006.

We both have a large supply of human capital and talent. We both are viewed with built in entrepreneurial spirit. I think, quite importantly, with respect to the natural cooperation that we have between the US and India, we are both robust among democracies," Stern said.\u000a\u000a"Already we are engaged in very constructive efforts with regard to technology at the bilateral level. We also have potential at the multilateral level \u2013 to build on the progress we made last year at Copenhagen," Stern said in his remarks at the US-India Energy Partnership Summit 2010 organised by The Energy and Resources Institute, North America, the Yale University and US-India Business Council.\u000a\u000aOne notable example of Indo-US bilateral cooperation clean energy is the new US-India partnership to advance clean energy, which was launched last year in November during the Washington visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.\u000a\u000a"The US has now committed USD 50 million of that partnership over the first five years," he said. "The two countries are now working in a number of areas. One of them being our efforts to set up a joint clean energy research center. That effort is led by the Department of Energy of the US," he said.\u000a\u000aStern said the two countries can achieve significant emissions reductions from the widespread deployment of existing technology. But there is also need to develop the next generation of technology.\u000a\u000aRajendra K Pachauri, the Director-General of TERI and Chairman, IPCC, said the conference this year acquires greater significance because US President Barack Obama would be traveling to India.\u000a\u000a"This has been a very productive exercise, where we looked at those technologies where there is shared interest in creating overall energy security," he said

Anbarasan said it was the duty of every citizen to protect the environment as it would pave way for economic growth and well being of society. The need of the hour was to develop the economy without disturbing the ecological balance.\u000a\u000aFactors such as huge population, multiplicity of vehicles, large-scale use of pesticide, wastes of nuclear power plants, plastic waste, deforestation and emission of poisonous gas from factories were the main factors that had adverse impact on environment. \u201cEnvironment can be saved by planting more trees, managing industrial waste effectively, using natural resources, solar energy, avoiding personal vehicles and creating awareness. Presently, India is ranked fourth in the list of countries that ruins the world environment. We all should strive hard to make India a green country,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn his presidential address, P. Mannar Jawahar, Vice-Chancellor, Anna University, called for use of wind and solar energy and asked the students to resolve to think green and be mindful of and sensitive to the natural environment.\u000a\u000aEnergy efficiency should be the hall mark of all future devices. Computers made from recycled material with components designed for easy recycling should be thought of. Designing of buildings to harvest natural light to meet the lighting requirement should be in the forefront. Incandescent bulbs should be replaced by compact florescent lights, he said.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aForty per cent of global emissions are attributed to buildings, informs one of the essays in \u2018Social Responsibility and Environmental Sustainability in Business: How organisations handle profits and social duties,\u2019 edited by Preeta M. Banerjee and Vanita Shastri (www.sagepublications.com).\u000a\u000aSustainable building practices can extend building life and provide cost savings, and also enhance employee productivity, as a healthier workplace leads to healthier employees, translating to less absenteeism, greater retention, and improved recruiting, writes the essay\u2019s author, Ameeta Soni. A \u2018green building,\u2019 she explains, \u2018uses less energy, water, and natural resources, creates less waste and is healthier for the people living inside compared to a standard building.\u2019\u000a\u000aDefining sustainability\u000a\u000aSustainability, for starters, is defined as \u2018meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\u2019 according to the World Commission on Environment and Development. In the context of buildings, what are widely accepted are the standards of LEED (the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), for both new construction and existing buildings.\u000a\u000aLEED\u2019s rating system has four levels, viz. certified, silver, gold, and platinum, and these are awarded based on the number of credits a building receives for satisfying specific performance benchmarks within various categories of sustainability.\u000a\u000aSix categories in LEED-NC, which governs \u2018new construction,\u2019 are sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, water efficiency, indoor environmental quality, materials and resources, and innovation in design. LEED-EB, a rating system for \u2018existing buildings\u2019 released in 2004, has one additional category, related to building operation and upgrades.\u000a\u000aExisting buildings\u000a\u000aNew construction techniques still garner the lion\u2019s share of the spotlight when it comes to media coverage related to building sustainability, observes Soni. But it is the facilities that already exist that represent the vast majority of building energy consumption and environmental impact, she adds.\u000a\u000aStatistics mentioned in the essay, relating to the US, speak of existing buildings accounting for 36 per cent of total energy use and 65 per cent of electricity consumption. \u201cThey make up 30 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and 30 per cent of waste output, a total of 136 million tonnes annually.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat can be heartening is that in India the rating system is applied with sensitivity to the context, addressing the national priorities. There is higher weight assigned to water efficiency, for example, potable water reduction and using grey water for landscape irrigation, one learns.\u000a\u000aEnergy conservation\u000a\u000aThe author lauds the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, which encourages energy-efficient design or retrofit of commercial buildings that have a connected load of 500 kW or greater, and buildings with conditioned floor area in excess of 1,000 square metres. \u201cIt is currently a voluntary scheme but could be made mandatory within the next few years, potentially yielding an annual savings of 1.7 billion units of power.\u201d\u000a\u000aAptly, she also mentions the Energy Conservation Building Code, ECBC 2007, developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (www.bee-india.nic.in), which is mandatory for commercial buildings and building complexes that have a connected load of more than 500 kW or a contract demand of 600 kVA or greater.\u000a\u000aThree stages\u000a\u000aGriha, you may know as \u2018house\u2019 in Sanskrit. But what is GRIHA? An acronym for Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment, a tool developed by TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute - www.teriin.org) for measuring and rating a building\u2019s environmental performance in the context of India\u2019s varied climate and building practices. This tool, adopted by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, uses qualitative and quantitative assessment criteria to rate a building on the degree of its greenness. The rating has the potential be applied to new and existing building stock of varied functions, the essay notes.\u000a\u000aThe \u2018basic features\u2019 of GRIHA, as described in www.grihaindia.org, speak of a system to help \u2018design and evaluate\u2019 new buildings, by assessing predicted performance over entire lifecycle \u2013 inception through operation. The first of the three stages of the lifecycle is \u2018pre-construction stage\u2019 with a focus on issues such as proximity to public transport, type of soil, kind of land, where the property is located, the flora and fauna on the land before construction activity starts, the natural landscape and land features.\u000a\u000aThe second stage is of \u2018building planning and construction,\u2019 where the issues are of resource conservation and reduction in resource demand, resource utilisation efficiency, resource recovery and reuse, and provisions for occupant health and wellbeing. And the third stage is of \u2018building operation and maintenance,\u2019 where attention is paid, among other things, to monitoring and recording of energy consumption.\u000a\u000aSavings in store\u000a\u000aTERI\u2019s work finds cited, again, in a section on reaping the benefits of green. Audits by TERI have revealed that annual energy bill can be saved 5 to 25 per cent, and therefore payback for recommended changed can be less than three years. A large portion of these savings are from the air-conditioning systems, and the remainder from areas such as lighting, Soni writes.\u000a\u000aSome countries have woken up to the need to incentivise energy efficiency, through concessional utility rates for energy-saving HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning) equipment, and newer models of computer that employ more power-efficient processors.\u000a\u000aFor instance, \u201cin the US, Energy Star programs currently enable owners or designers of new or existing commercial buildings to taka a tax deduction of up to $1.80 per square foot if they save at least 50 per cent of the heating and cooling energy of a building that meets American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards for energy-efficient design.\u201d\u000a\u000aHopes on the horizon\u000a\u000aA recent paper in http://new.evomarkets.com, titled \u2018Energy Efficiency in the US and India: A study in contrasts and possibilities\u2019 sees hope in venture capital funding to support companies that manufacture energy-efficient products and provide related services in the sector, in India. \u201cStay tuned; Indian policy is rapidly evolving with numerous favourable programmes on the horizon,\u201d conclude the paper\u2019s authors Patrick McCloskey and Stanley Trybulski of Evolution Markets Financial Services.\u000a\u000aRecommended \u2018green\u2019 read.

Another crucial issue heading into the next round of talks is the question of financial support and aid from developed countries for climate projects in developing countries.\u000a\u000aDemands from the West for Measurement, Reporting and Verification of emissions reduction projects in developing countries are another point of difference.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations in Tianjin would help narrow these differences and \u201cestablish the groundwork\u201d ahead of the November 29 Cancun conference, said Mr. Xie. A binding deal at the conference was unlikely, but China remained hopeful of reaching a deal in South Africa in 2011.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe already have a proposal on the table for long-term cooperative action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\u201d he said. \u201cAll countries will try to eliminate divergence as much as possible in Tianjin.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina, along with India, Brazil and South Africa, will play a key role in this week's talks in representing the interests of developing nations. Negotiators from more than 190 parties will attend the six-day talks in Tianjin. Between October 4 and 9, two working groups will meet to discuss two draft documents \u2014 a 70-page negotiating text for Cancun, as well as a draft proposal under the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aIndia's Minister of Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh is scheduled to arrive here on October 10, and will meet with Mr. Xie and other Ministers after the negotiations conclude.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations in Tianjin mark the first instance of China hosting high-level climate negotiations \u2014 an indicator, according to some analysts, of the country's growing influence on the climate debate.\u000a\u000aChina has committed to reducing the carbon intensity of its emissions, or emissions per unit of GDP, by 40 per cent of 2005 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aBut as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, developed nations say China should take on greater commitments.\u000a\u000aMr. Xie, however, said China had \u201calready paid a high price\u201d in taking on its current targets. \u201cAs a developing country, China faces more challenges than developed nations to control greenhouse gas emissions, since China has to boost economic growth, improve livelihoods and protect the environment at the same time,\u201d he said.

a((VGreen technology is a technology that is environment-friendly and ensures that natural resources are conserved. The chief aim of this green technology is to avoid any deterioration to the environment. Green technology helps in reducing the amount of pollution that is being emitted during the process of both production and consumption; air pollution, water pollution and atmospheric pollution, resulting in hazards such as global warming and the ozone hole.\u000a\u000aIndia is essentially a country that needs to implement green technology because of its vast geographic area and growing population, and also for the reason that India has been identified as one of the chief markets in the world. Both the production and consumption are on such a massive scale that one can easily witness the tremendous amount of damage that is being caused to the environment and natural resources. If the trend continues, then one day well no option but to rectify our mistakes, some of which are irreparable.\u000a\u000aGreen technology is not only essential for sustainable development in the long-run but there are also short-term advantages of using eco-friendly fuels. India can use cradle to cradle technology, rather than cradle to grave, that can be fully re-used. But the question is how can India develop and tap green technology\u000a\u000aThere are certain crucial issues that need to be focused upon while introducing green technology. For instance, a social awareness about the need for environment-friendly goods and services for production and consumption at a larger scale is required. For this massive campaigns need to be undertaken. Last but not the least, green technology as a subject needs to be made mandatory in academics.\u000a\u000aThe author is a student of MBA at the RK College of Engineering, Vijayawada

a((VThe term technology refers to the application of knowledge for practical purposes. And the field of green technology encompasses a continuously evolving group of methods and materials, from techniques for generating energy to non-toxic cleaning products. Its major components are sustainability (meeting energy needs in ways that can continue indefinitely without depleting natural resources), reducing waste by changing the patterns of production and consumption, developing alternatives to technologies that have been demonstrated to damage the environment, and creating a centre of economic activity around technologies and products that benefit the environment.\u000a\u000aAlso, renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar panels or bio-gas created by animal dung should be encouraged.\u000a\u000aSince India is a large country with a growing population, there will be a tremendous demand for technology-oriented production and consumption process in the years to come.

a((VUpdated: Mon, Oct 04 2010. 03 18 PM IST\u000a\u000aSingapore: In a strategic shift, the United Nations has stopped urging nations to commit to tougher pledges to curb carbon emissions, fearing further debate could derail already fraught talks on a more ambitious climate pact.\u000a\u000aIt is better to start with pledges already offered and build from there, officials say, given the short time left to hammer out a pact that broadens the existing Kyoto Protocol by signing up all major emitters to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aThis effort is critical to ensure there is no gap after the end of Kyoto\u2019s first phase in 2012, to assure certainty to investors in the $2.7 billion UN carbon market. \u201cThese pledges fall short of expectations but are not likely to change in the short run,\u201d senior UN climate official Halldor Thorgeirsson said in a speech late last month. \u201cContinuing to negotiate ambition delays delivery of action.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe comments recognise that the talks risk stalling over the bitter issue of sharing the emissions-cutting burden between rich and poor nations and the lack of trust between major players, such top emitters China and the United States.\u000a\u000aOne senior climate negotiator called the move damage control.\u000a\u000aThorgeirsson\u2019s comments are also recognition that existing pledges will not stop the world warming well beyond an agreed temperature limit of less than 2 degrees celsius.\u000a\u000aAbove this temperature, scientists say the world faces dangerous climate change, such as crop failures and wilder weather swings such as those that brought floods in Pakistan and drought in Russia this year.\u000a\u000aGovernments should focus on securing formal pledges of the emissions cuts already proposed, \u201cfully realising it is a first, necessary but insufficient step\u201d, the UN\u2019s top climate official, Christiana Figueres, told Reuters on the sidelines of UN climate talks in China.\u000a\u000aThe one-week talks began on Monday in the northern city of Tianjin and aim to try and find a way forward ahead of a major meeting in the Mexican resort of Cancun from late November.\u000a\u000aChallenges\u000a\u000aNegotiators are looking for ways to formalise the existing pledges of rich and poor nations listed under the Copenhagen Accord, a non-binding pact agreed amid acrimony at climate talks last year in Denmark.\u000a\u000aA leaked UN report last year said the pledges would mean a world temperature rise of 3 degrees celsius. Scientists say greenhouse gas levels are rising quickly from big emitters such as China and that there is little time to act.\u000a\u000aTough targets are also crucial to help governments and businesses frame policies to guide investment away from polluting fossil fuels into green energy, such as wind and solar power.\u000a\u000aMobilising potentially trillions of dollars in private capital is key to the climate fight and the final shape of any new climate pact will help determine how this money is spent.\u000a\u000aThis is why the UN hopes the Cancun talks agree on less controversial issues, such as launching a scheme to curb deforestation, a fund to help poorer nations adapt to climate impacts and a deal to share clean energy technology.\u000a\u000aFormalising the existing emissions reduction or mitigation, pledges and placing them in a legally binding form will be a much tougher challenge, negotiators and analysts say.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you don\u2019t crack the mitigation nut, I don\u2019t think you get a deal,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate and energy programme of the Washington-based World Resources Institute.\u000a\u000aOne of the big questions ministers face, she said, is \u201cWould they formalise their pledges and what is that linked with. Is that linked with a review of adequacy and what\u2019s the form of it?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was crucial to build in a future review of the targets and climate science that could trigger talks on agreeing tougher targets as a way of tightening a new agreement, she said.\u000a\u000aFirst cuts aren\u2019t the deepest\u000a\u000aThe UN climate panel says rich nations need to cut emissions by 25-40% by 2020 from 1990 levels to avert dangerous climate change.\u000a\u000aBig emitters China, India, Brazil and Indonesia have offered voluntary steps to rein emissions growth, but not absolute cuts. Kyoto only binds rich nations to meet emissions targets.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries have also insisted rich nations agree to cuts of at least 40% by 2020 as a first step and how this demand is resolved is key.\u000a\u000aAgreement on specific targets from rich nations is also unclear, since some nations have set ranges under the Copenhagen Accord, depending on the strength of any future climate pact.\u000a\u000aAustralia has pledged an unconditional cut of 5 percent by 2020 from 2000 levels to a maximum of minus 25%.\u000a\u000aEurope has pledged to cut emissions by 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels, Kyoto\u2019s base year, and up to 30% if all nations do more but it\u2019s unclear if Europe would accept Australia\u2019s minus 5% target as part of a binding decision.\u000a\u000aFor now, big emitters are unlikely to up their offers, partly because of lack of clarity on climate funds for poorer nations, no firm pact on monitoring developing countries\u2019 CO2-cutting efforts and failure of the US Congress to pass a climate bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith respect to the targets, I think there will be an effort to enshrine the targets into decisions,\u201d said Ian Fry, the lead negotiator from Tuvalu, a low-lying cluster of Pacific atolls that fears rising seas could wipe it off the map.\u000a\u000aHow to formalise the pledges remains a puzzle, Morgan said, but it goes to the heart of the eventual shape of a broader, legally binding climate pact.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s controversial for some countries to think about taking that (Copenhagen) Accord and putting it into decisions but in some ways we don\u2019t have a lot of time to start over again,\u201d Morgan said.

Therefore, we face significant constraints in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," he said.The Chinese government made set goals for itself before the Copenhagen climate talks in late 2009, including cutting the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent, compared with 2005 levels.China also said it would increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 15 per cent and have 40 million more hectares of forest by 2020.

a((VIndia is now world's third biggest carbon dioxide emitting nation after China and the US.\u000a\u000aThe new emission data from the United Nations is a probable cause of worry for India's climate negotiators at the next round of talks that started in Tianjin in China on Monday, where rich countries are expected to ask India and China to take legally binding emission cuts after 2012, when present global climate treaty expires.\u000a\u000aChina in 2009 moved to the top position while contributing 23 per cent of the total global emissions and India this year surpassed Russia to take the third position with five percent.\u000a\u000aThe saving grace is that the difference in total carbon emissions between the US (22 per cent) and India, is still huge. Russia's emissions have been fallen because of economic slowdown.\u000a\u000aThe data prompted Environment minister Jairam Ramesh to comment that the country cannot afford to strive for high economic growth and rise in carbon emissions.\u000a\u000a"We will unilaterally, voluntarily, move on a low-carbon growth path. We can't have 8-9 percent GDP growth and high-carbon growth," news agencies quoted Ramesh saying at the sidelines of an environment meet in Kathmandu.\u000a\u000aIndia's per-capita carbon emission is still lowest in the world (about 4.5 tonnes) but the demand for energy is rising, especially among the middle-class.\u000a\u000aRamesh, first to comment on India's position, said India's rush for wealth could not come at the expense of the environment. "Its to be low-carbon 8 percent, 9 percent growth and that is the objective that we have set for ourselves," he said.\u000a\u000aBut, the pressure on India and China to reduce emissions is rsing.

Now is the time to accelerate the search for common ground," UN Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary Christiana Figueres said in an address.The officials would discuss the negotiating text reached at the Bonn talks in August by the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention.A draft proposal, by the Chair of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol, will also be tabled for discussion.The two working groups have held three rounds of talks this year without any major success.This will be the last meeting before Cancun summit, and India, and other developing countries are not too optimistic about reaching an agreement on emission cuts with developed countries.Last year's summit in Copenhagen, which was projected as a make-or-break meeting, ended without producing a legally binding deal to curb global climate change.It is to be seen whether the India-China rapport displayed at Copenhagen which successfully withstood pressure mounted by developed countries to impose legally-binding cuts would continue.Figueres played down expectations of a binding deal being struck at the due to persisting differences."Let me be clear - there is no magic bullet, no one climate agreement that will solve everything right now... To expect that is naive," she said in a statement ahead of the talks.

George, secretary of the co-operative society told PTI.\u000a\u000aThis was for the first time that such a huge fall in honey procurement was recorded since the co-operative was formed 30 years ago, he said.\u000a\u000aAccording to V. Kesavan, president of the Kerala State Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Cooperative Federation, the apex body of the tribal co-operatives, the availability all the 32 tribal societies in Kerala recorded a sharp fall in wild honey collection this year.\u000a\u000aThe decline in honey production has made the lives of the tribal people miserable as collection of honey is their main source of livelihood for them in the monsoon season, Tribal welfare workers said.\u000a\u000aThe honey harvesting season in Wayanad stretches from April to September. At the outset of the season tribal men, especially \u201cKattunayakas\u201d, start preparing for their treasure-hunt deep in the forest.\u000a\u000aTheir folk knowledge, familiarity with the terrain and ability to withstand the ordeal make the Kattunayakas good honey collectors.\u000a\u000aBees tend to make hives on the same trees every year, which the tribal people call \u2018honey trees.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe honey collectors spend more than a week in the forests to harvest honey, which is not a sweet job as often they have to suffer not just single stings but dangerous attacks by drones.\u000a\u000aHoney is collected only during night as that is the traditional method, said Madhavan, who has been part of honey-harvesting band for long years said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we set out to the forest this year we saw heaps of perished nectar bearing flowers lying scattered,\u201d Madhavan, head of Kattunayaka settlement at Ponkuzhy said.\u000a\u000aFlowers have dropped off the trees and plants before growing into full bloom. This was the case not only in Wayanad but also the adjoining Mudhumala in Tamil Nadu and Bandipur in Karnataka, Mr. Madhavan said.\u000a\u000aFlowering and fruit-bearing stages of the trees are important in the production of honey and changes in climatic cycles would harm the natural process and lead to decline in honey production, Dr Anil Kumar, Director of M S Swamithan Research Foundation here said.\u000a\u000aThe honey bees collect nectar mainly from different species of Terminalia (Maruthu )trees inside the forest and honey production mostly depend on the blooming of the tree, he added.\u000a\u000aRock bees (apis dorsata), Indian little bees (apis florea), sting-less bees (of the trigona species) and the common honey bees (apis cerana indica) are the ones seen in Wayanad and the adjacent forests, a senior entomologist of the Horticultural College here said.

a((VUpdated: Wed, Oct 06 2010. 10 58 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: In data-based research that can influence the understanding of climate change, scientists have raised doubts about accepted theories on the extent to which solar activity heats up the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u000a\u000aSolar activity, astronomers have long held, waxes and wanes over roughly 11-year cycles. Increased activity heats up the earth\u2019s atmosphere at a faster rate.\u000a\u000aBut an analysis published in the journal Nature by scientists from Imperial College, London, using satellite data of solar radiation between 2004 and 2007, says that if accepted models that relate solar activity and Earth\u2019s temperature are accurate, Earth\u2019s climate should have cooled in these years.\u000a\u000aObservations, on the other hand, say that over the past decade, temperatures on Earth have steadily increased and are believed to be the key drivers of long-term and large-scale changes in climate.\u000a\u000aWhile many scientists and multilateral bodies such as the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) hold that the release of industrial gases into the atmosphere is mainly responsible for the rise in temperatue, the extent to which solar activity influences the process is not clear. Estimates on the role of solar activity in raising temperatures on earth range from 2% to 25%.\u000a\u000aIt is only since 1978 that scientists have been able to observe the solar radiation spectrum via satellites and model how each radiation affects various levels of the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u2018These observations were made during the declining phase of the previous solar cycle,\u201d said Joanna Haigh, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College and the lead author of the study.\u000a\u000aIn a telephone interview, Haigh said her team\u2019s observations could be a one-off case. It will take more than a decade\u2014 when solar activity is waning again\u2014before the same measuresments can be made and compared.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if this not an anomaly and a trend,\u201d she added, \u201cit could significantly alter our understanding of how solar variability affects earth\u2019s climate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study also found that key kinds of radiation\u2014ultraviolet, infrared and visible\u2014differently affected various layers of the atmosphere and didn\u2019t, as was supposed, heat all the layers uniformly.\u000a\u000aCurrent models that extrapolate climate trends into the future do account for solar variability, but don\u2019t account for how different wavelengths of radiation affect sections of the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more complexity that isn\u2019t being accounted for in current IPCC models,\u201d said Haigh.\u000a\u000aShe added that despite the anomalous observations, \u201cfluctuations in solar radiation was unlikely to significantly account for global warming.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to a research paper by the Stanford Solar Center, the variation in energy emitted by the sun through the 11-year cycle is only about 10%. Past studies have said that when the solar cycle is at a maximum, it puts out a larger percentage of high-energy radiation, which increases the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThe increased ozone warms the upper atmosphere and the warm air affects winds all the way from the stratosphere\u2014 the atmospheric layer at 6-30 miles from earth. Changes in wind strength and direction lead to different climate patterns around the globe.\u000a\u000aRolando Garcia, atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, US, said it was too early for researchers to revise their solar variability theories and models.\u000a\u000aSeveral independent observations over 20 years had borne out the mechanism between solar variability and climate, he said, and more observations are needed to cancel the effects of \u201cinstrument drift\u201d, when satellites give erroneous readings as they wobble out of orbit.\u000a\u000ajacob.k@livemint.com

Investors are already familiar with bond instruments, and as of 2009, the size of the worldwide bond market was an estimated $82.2 trillion, the report said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince international policymakers view the mobilization of substantial amounts of private sector capital into climate change financing within the next two years as a major priority, we see the results of this risk-ranking exercise as a useful illustration of the obstacles that need to be cleared in order to achieve this aim,\u201d said S&P.\u000a\u000aSome investors have bought green bonds, which help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. In December 2009, the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, one of the world\u2019s largest pension funds, bought green bonds in a $130 million issuance by the World Bank.\u000a\u000aOther alternative risk transfer instruments have been used to protect countries from the risk of natural catastrophes, which will increase the frequency of bad weather according to climate change commentators.\u000a\u000aMunich Re, the world\u2019s biggest re-insurer, said that there had been 725 natural hazard occurrences linked to weather in the first nine months of the year, which is a strong indication of climate change.\u000a\u000aCatastrophe bonds, in which insurers transfer the risk of natural hazards such as hurricanes to the capital markets, have been used to protect countries from such risks.\u000a\u000aIn October 2009, Swiss Re worked with the Fund for Natural Disasters of Mexico to issue a $290 million cat bond to protect Mexico against earthquake risk.

Smith was on a visit to city-based Suzlon One Earth headquarters in Hadapsar on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"There is a general impression that green buildings are costly. But the cost when spread over a period is not only beneficial but also of immense importance for saving our globe. Our aim is to promote responsible building amongst corporates. Green buildings cost less over period, are energy efficient and help defeat climate change," he said.\u000a\u000aUSGBC is a Washington DC-based non profit organisation committed to sustainable development through cost effective and energy-saving green buildings. The council also runs Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification programme as a part of which the LEED India provides building owners, architects, consultants, developers, facility and project managers tools that they need to design, construct and operate green buildings. "In India, till date we have had over 350 registrations, out of which 50 have been certified and three have been awarded Platinum rating by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC)," said Smith.\u000a\u000aWorking closely on a B2B module that involves urging developers towards creating green structures, Smith said in India he felt the need to involve the government agencies in promoting the concept.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Jan 31 deadline looms, those without Aadhaar ID will have to pay market price for LPG\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

While the deadlock between developed and developing nations continues over agreeing on a legally binding plan, China is driving home the point that it\u2019s taking drastic domestic action.\u000a\u000aBeijing had pledged to cut energy use per unit of GDP by 20 per cent in 2010, compared to 2005 levels. China\u2019s top climate negotiator said on Monday that 18 regions are likely to meet the target, but six to seven regions are facing challenges despite power blackouts.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe only achieved a 15.6 per cent cut by 2009, so we have to cut 5 per cent this year to reach our target,\u201d Xie Zhenhua, vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, was quoted saying in Tianjin.\u000a\u000aIndian environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who says India will focus on low-carbon economic growth at 8-9 per cent, will arrive in Tianjin on October 10. China would also focus on restructuring the economy to save energy use, top legislator Dai Bingguo said.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s energy consumption rose by 0.09 in the year\u2019s first half, after falling from 2005-09. Premier Wen Jiabao has warned that local officials may be punished or sacked for failing to meet energy efficiency targets. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging to further cut energy use,\u2019\u2019 the China Daily quoted Xie saying. \u201cWe have to adopt active measures.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina also plans to reduce carbon intensity, or carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 per cent of 2005 levels by 2020. India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon dioxide polluter, aims to cut carbon intensity by half as much.\u000a\u000aRich nations need to cut carbon: China\u000a\u000aGreenhouse gas cuts vowed by rich nations remain far from enough to escape dangerous global warming, a top Chinese climate official said on Tuesday, urging talks over a new climate change pact to confront the shortfall.\u000a\u000aBut Su Wei, the head of the climate change office at China's National Development and Reform Commission, said wealthy countries with their much higher emissions per head of population should make space for emerging economies.\u000a\u000a"The emissions targets of developed countries should be dramatically raised," he said adding that this would "create the room necessary for developing countries' emissions".

Differences have also surfaced over developed countries repackaging earlier development aid as climate-related funding.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot simply fill a new bottle with old wine,\u201d said Su Wei, director of the climate change department of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the country's chief climate negotiator.\u000a\u000aIndian and Chinese officials have also expressed their frustration at attempts by negotiators from the West, particularly from the United States, to divide developing nations on the finance issue. Developed countries this week reiterated calls for large developing nations to commit to financing projects in less developed countries.\u000a\u000aAt the Copenhagen summit in December last year, developed countries pledged to commit $30 billion to \u201cfast start\u201d projects in the next three years. While much of this amount has been identified, differences have persisted on how much funding would be new commitments and how much would be derived from earlier pledged development assistance. Mr. Su said on Wednesday the money had to be \u201cnew and additional\u201d, and not redirected from earlier commitments such as Overseas Development Assistance programmes. While Chinese officials this week played down expectations of a binding deal being reached at Cancun, they have identified climate finance as a priority for the year-end talks. \u201cThere is a lot of expectation of some agreement on climate finance being reached in Cancun,\u201d Yang Ailun, Greenpeace China's head of climate and energy, told The Hindu. \u201cThe Chinese delegation has even defined the success of the Cancun conference in terms of climate finance.\u201d\u000a\u000aDifferences, however, remain on how projects funded by financial aid would be measured, reported and verified (MRV) by developed countries.\u000a\u000aProposals from the U.S., according to sources, had called for strict measures in terms of data transparency as a condition for receiving assistance. Mr. Su said China had no objection to MRV for internationally-financed projects, as long as it \u201crespected developing countries' sovereignty\u201d and was \u201cnon-confrontational\u201d. But what would fall within those terms remained unclear.\u000a\u000aGreen groups have criticised moves to link data transparency to climate finance. \u201cIt is a tactic to put pressure on countries like China and India, by saying that if you want to get financial aid from us, there needs to be a particular level of data transparency,\u201d said Ms. Yang. \u201cThis tactic should be condemned, as developed countries, first and foremost, have a responsibility to commit aid. Linking this to another issue is irresponsible.\u201d

Estimates on the role of solar activity in raising temperatures on earth range from 2% to 25%.\u000a\u000aIt is only since 1978 that scientists have been able to observe the solar radiation spectrum via satellites and model how each radiation affects various levels of the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u2018These observations were made during the declining phase of the previous solar cycle,\u201d said Joanna Haigh, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College and the lead author of the study.\u000a\u000aIn a telephone interview, Haigh said her team\u2019s observations could be a one-off case. It will take more than a decade\u2014 when solar activity is waning again\u2014before the same measuresments can be made and compared.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if this not an anomaly and a trend,\u201d she added, \u201cit could significantly alter our understanding of how solar variability affects earth\u2019s climate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study also found that key kinds of radiation\u2014ultraviolet, infrared and visible\u2014differently affected various layers of the atmosphere and didn\u2019t, as was supposed, heat all the layers uniformly.\u000a\u000aCurrent models that extrapolate climate trends into the future do account for solar variability, but don\u2019t account for how different wavelengths of radiation affect sections of the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more complexity that isn\u2019t being accounted for in current IPCC models,\u201d said Haigh.\u000a\u000aShe added that despite the anomalous observations, \u201cfluctuations in solar radiation was unlikely to significantly account for global warming.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to a research paper by the Stanford Solar Center, the variation in energy emitted by the sun through the 11-year cycle is only about 10%. Past studies have said that when the solar cycle is at a maximum, it puts out a larger percentage of high-energy radiation, which increases the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThe increased ozone warms the upper atmosphere and the warm air affects winds all the way from the stratosphere\u2014 the atmospheric layer at 6-30 miles from earth. Changes in wind strength and direction lead to different climate patterns around the globe.\u000a\u000aRolando Garcia, atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, US, said it was too early for researchers to revise their solar variability theories and models.\u000a\u000aSeveral independent observations over 20 years had borne out the mechanism between solar variability and climate, he said, and more observations are needed to cancel the effects of \u201cinstrument drift\u201d, when satellites give erroneous readings as they wobble out of orbit.\u000a\u000ajacob.k@livemint.com

a((VUpdated: Sun, Oct 24 2010. 10 49 PM IST\u000a\u000aWith good reason, the United Nations has declared 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity, but global attention has been inadequate.\u000a\u000aA widely used technical definition of biodiversity is: \u201cThe variability among living organisms from all sources, including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: This includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.\u201d Simply put, it\u2019s the incredible number and diversity of life forms on earth, and their complex, mostly unknowable linkages.\u000a\u000aEstimates of the number of species currently on the planet vary from five million to 100 million, with a loose consensus around the 10-20 million level. This is the simplest measure of biodiversity.\u000a\u000aAlso Read | Anurag Behar\u2019s previous columns\u000a\u000aWhat does biodiversity do for us? There are some simple, direct benefits that all of us can see every day. A number of \u201ceconomic goods\u201d come from it: medicines, fibres, rubber, wood, paper, oil and so on. But this is just the most mundane and superficial impact of biodiversity. Some of the deeper, complex phenomena, on which humanity depends, are our entire food chain, practically all our \u201cecosystem services\u201d (for example, the chemistry of the atmosphere, purification of water in nature and its supply, soil nutrient cycles) and climate change, which both affects and is affected by biodiversity.\u000a\u000aWe, Homo sapiens, are an inextricable part of this complex web of life. It\u2019s both presumptuous and silly to ask what biodiversity does for us\u2014a little like asking what the rest of the body and organs do for the bones, or (since this is a business newspaper) what the rest of the organization does for the accountants.\u000a\u000aWe don\u2019t, and never will, actually understand all the intricacies of this complex web. Rigorous scientific research has given us many insights, among the most powerful being that the more biodiverse a system, the more stable it is.\u000a\u000aWe are losing this biodiversity at a rate that is about a thousand times faster than the \u201cbackground rate\u201d of the extinction of species. The \u201cbackground rate\u201d is the natural rate of extinction derived from fossil records of the past 540 million (sic) years. The potentially tragic destinies of the panda, the tiger and the rhino are always in the spotlight. We should be conscious of the fact that this is less than the tip of the iceberg.\u000a\u000aThe International Union for Conservation of Nature has developed a widely used classification of the causes of biodiversity loss. This is exhaustive and immeasurably useful, but it\u2019s not possible to repeat it here. For our purposes, E.O. Wilson\u2019s evocative capturing of the essence of the causes in the acronym HIPPO is sufficient. HIPPO stands for habitat destruction, invasive species, pollution, human overpopulation, and overharvesting of wild species. All of this is caused by humans. To this list we can add human-induced climate change.\u000a\u000aSome estimates project that 30% of all species currently on the planet will be extinct by 2050. These estimates also suggest that if the rates of biodiversity loss continue to be what they are, most species will become extinct in a few hundred years.\u000a\u000aFive times in the past 540 million years, the earth has gone through \u201cmass extinction\u201d\u2014the wiping out of millions of species in a short period of time. In each of these episodes, more than 50% of all erstwhile species became extinct. Fossil records are fairly clear about these extinctions. The last and most famous of these, the Cretaceous Tertiary Extinction, which happened around 65 million years ago, wiped out the dinosaurs.\u000a\u000aWe are actually living through the sixth such mass extinction, and the current rate of species loss is as much or more than that during any of the previous five episodes. Scientists call this phase the \u201cHolocene extinction\u201d.\u000a\u000aIs the situation as desperate and dramatic as I am making it out to be? The scientific evidence is fairly clear\u2014it\u2019s up to each of us to draw our own conclusions. It would be useful to remember that this is a drama that has in the past always happened over \u201cgeological time scales\u201d. This time, it seems to be unfolding in a flash\u2014over human generational time scales.\u000a\u000aThere are some hypotheses, but we are not sure as to what caused the last five extinctions, nor can we be sure what earth and life on it was like after each such episode. This, the sixth time, we are sure about the cause\u2014us. However, we can only be as unsure about what earth and life will be like afterwards.\u000a\u000aThere is another reason why I would like to be unsure about the outcome. This time around, the \u201ccause\u201d\u2014humanity, us\u2014can be conscious of its effect. And if we become conscious enough, we will hopefully do things to reverse the trend, making this not the sixth mass extinction, but an extinction blip in the long history and future of this planet. We need to place all our bets on that.\u000a\u000aAnurag Behar is co-CEO of Azim Premji Foundation and also leads sustainability initiatives for Wipro Ltd.

a((VWhere there is consumption, there is likely to be some waste. From a purely business perspective, no one would like waste. Businesses spend time and money to ensure that operations are efficient with the most optimum consumption of material resources and time. Therefore, building a low carbon global economy would be a natural progression for us.\u000a\u000aBuilding a truly low carbon economy is not just for the governments. It is a collective responsibility of all. This concept is necessitated by the consequences of industrialisation the spiralling impact of mass consumption. Beyond the esoteric definitions, a low carbon economy would be that which is sustainable today as well as tomorrow. Mahatma Gandhi once said, The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the worlds problems.\u000a\u000aAim of a low carbon economy\u000a\u000aThe aim of a low carbon economy is to integrate all productive aspects of the economy around technologies that produce energy and materials with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. It is to ensure that populations, buildings, machines and devices use energies and materials efficiently.\u000a\u000aFrom the perspective of an oil & gas company, low carbon economy means decoupling economic growth and consumption of carbon resources. It is perhaps ironical and a cruel twist of fate that just when the developing world have begun to industrialise and break out of decades of poverty, we have to deal with the blow of global climate change.\u000a\u000aThe status of developing countries from a development perspective can at best described as work in progress. Suddenly, a decade of prosperity in the developing countries is being targeted and people often forget the rampant exploitation of resources by the developed world for over a century.\u000a\u000aThe World Resources Institute estimates, in terms of historical emissions, show industrialised countries account for roughly 80% of the carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere till date. Since 1950, the US has emitted a cumulative total of roughly 50.7 billion tonne of carbon, while China (4.6 times more populous) and India (3.5 times more populous) have emitted only 15.7 and 4.2 billion tonne respectively. Annually, more than 60% of global industrial carbon dioxide emissions originate in industrialised countries, where only about 20% of the worlds population resides.\u000a\u000aOf course, this is not to shy away from the responsibility of mitigating climate change. For the developed world, climate change is a sporadic occurrence. But for the developing world, it is a matter of survival and the victims are most often those who are the poorest of the poor. The tragedy is that global climate change will affect the developing countries more than the developed ones. And the sooner the developing countries formulate plans and mechanisms to mitigate the impact, the better for them.\u000a\u000aFor a developing country, the challenge of transition into a low carbon economy is multipronged. The following paragraphs spell out some of the issues.\u000a\u000aA majority of the global workforce is in the unorganised sector and agriculture is a dominant part of it. In fact, in India, the agricultural sector accounts for 52% of the work force. Though the country has the second largest worldwide farm output, its agricultural yield is just about 50% of the highest average yield in the world. Farming contributes about a quarter of the total greenhouse gas emissions. So, one of the tasks could be to introduce more efficient irrigation processes, reduction of synthetic fertilisers and better crop mixes, etc.\u000a\u000aSecondly, the information technology revolution changed the way we perceive business. It empowered us, shrank distances, empowered people with information, reduced costs and digitised our lives. Similarly, we need a new revolution centered on sustainability. The model adopted to encourage environmental awareness amongst government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, and builders has already become a standard in many countries. Developing countries, including India, too would need green approach to construction design, waste management, energy and water consumption, etc. We need to re-look the way we build our offices and homes, the way we travel and the way we live. In the future, when engineers and designers plan a building, process plant or an industrial unit, they will do so keeping in mind sustainability issues. Training the construction force to build green buildings would be a huge opportunity.\u000a\u000aComing to sustainable models of transport, we can see that the US models of individualised transport requires another look in developing countries. In India, car ownership is rising and we cannot afford to build roads for 200 million cars in the future. The focus, rightly, is shifting to mass rapid transit systems and freight corridors.\u000a\u000aThe explosion in the number of computers, mobiles and gadgets is another area where expertise is required to ensure efficient design and maintenance. In fact, IT infrastructure is one of the biggest power guzzlers in companies and persons operating such facilities would do well to have green computing ability.\u000a\u000aCompetition for green talent will rise. Though Indias vast technical manpower will continue to make available adequate resources for domestic companies, there is competition to retain good talent. This would mean making more efforts to train semi-skilled labour in deploying cutting-edge green technologies. Green Collar jobs will pick up in the future. We could be soon seeing a new category of workers whose job would be to bring in sustainable concepts to business. In the post industrialisation era, the shift was from blue-collar workers to white-collar workers. We might as well see a further shift to green-collar workers who will be a vital part of a corporates operational strategy.\u000a\u000aIndianOils green initiatives\u000a\u000aIndianOil was among the pioneers in tapping alternative energy opportunities. We have set up wind farms and solar charging stations. We have one of the largest bio-fuel ventures for production of bio-diesel. There is a dedicated renewable energy group in the company that explores the potential in this field and invests resources.\u000a\u000aLiquefied petroleum gas has been a big tool in preventing deforestation. As a reliable and convenient domestic cooking fuel, LPG is supplied in cylinders. I remember that when we introduced bottled LPG in 1970s, there were apprehensions. People were not comfortable with compact cylinders which are called refills. We embarked on a countrywide multimedia awareness campaign and managed to change the mindsets of an entire generation of Indians. Today, LPG has lead to a substantial improvement in the health of women in rural areas by replacing smoky and unhealthy chullahs with Indane. And LPG has emerged as one of the biggest success stories in preventing deforestation in the country.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, when natural gas emerged as an alternative, we made plans to roll out city gas distribution networks for homes and automobiles.\u000a\u000aIndianOils network of retail stations, numbering over 18,000, dots the Indian landscape. Provision of automated facilities and solar-powered lighting at our retail outlets have contributed to a paperless and low-power consumption environment. But more needs to be done. We have taken several initiatives like the consolidation of servers which has helped improve power efficiency.\u000a\u000aCorporate accounting and reporting of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are not regulated in India. But the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in the year 2009 notes that 44 companies out of 200 Indian companies responded to the CDP survey.\u000a\u000aRecently, Prime Ministers Council for Climate Change in India has led to the identification of eight core national missions for sustainable development in the country. This includes the national solar mission and enhanced energy efficiency mission which is expected to save 5% of Indias annual energy consumption by the year 2015. The Energy Conservation Act of 2001 first established the Bureau of Efficiency which develops policies, schemes and strategies to encourage reduction of energy intensity in the economy.\u000a\u000aEvery citizen of the world has a responsibility to ensure that our future generations have an equally fulfilling and equitable life full of opportunities, if not more. The efforts need to be made across regions, countries, groups and beliefs. Building the skills or green talent for a low carbon economy is a joint responsibility. If we fail today, the future will judge us as a generation that failed them.\u000a\u000aThe writer is IndianOil chairman

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIn what may renew the debate over the science behind climate change, a new research has claimed that an increase in solar activity actually cools the earth.\u000a\u000aIt has been believed that sun\u2019s activity waxes and wanes over an 11-year cycle and that when its activity wanes, the overall amount of radiation reaching the earth decreases.\u000a\u000aNow, the new study by researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Colorado found that as solar activity decreased, the amount of light and heat reaching the earth rose rather than fell, causing the planet to become warmer.\u000a\u000aThe researchers, who looked at the sun\u2019s activity over the period 2004-2007 when it was in a declining phase of a cycle, said a decline in the sun\u2019s activity does not always mean that the earth becomes cooler. Its impact on melting polar ice caps, and drying up rivers could therefore have been exaggerated by conventional climate models during the period, the Telegraph reported.\u000a\u000aThe scientists also believe it may also be possible that during the next upturn of the cycle, when solar activity increases, there might be a cooling effect at the earth\u2019s surface.\u000a\u000aWhile this may support climate change sceptics\u2019 arguments in the short term, long term analysis suggests it actually provides further evidence that the heating of the planet is more than a natural, cyclical phenomenon, they said.\u000a\u000aProfessor Joanna Haigh, from Imperial College London, who led the study, said: \u201cThese results are challenging what we thought we knew about the sun\u2019s effect on our climate.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, they only show us a snapshot of the sun\u2019s activity and its behaviour over the three years of our study could be an anomaly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot jump to any conclusions based on what we have found during this comparatively short period and we need to carry out further studies to explore the sun\u2019s activity and the patterns that we have uncovered on longer timescales.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, if further studies find the same pattern over a longer period of time, this could suggest that we may have overestimated the sun\u2019s role in warming the planet, rather than underestimating it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe research, published in the journal Nature, is based on data from a satellite called SORCE (Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment) that has been measuring the sun\u2019s energy output at X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths.

But India has just not been very visible.\u201d\u000a\u000aNegotiators from several countries and climate analysts said the talks yielded some positive results, most notably on bridging differences over climate finance from developed countries.\u000a\u000aUnited Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres said she was optimistic that a plan for developed nations to fund $30 billion of \u201cfast start\u201d projects in developing countries to combat climate change would be finalised at Cancun, despite persisting differences. \u201cI have said and I will continue to say that fast-track finance is the golden key to Cancun,\u201d she said. \u201cI am confident that the golden key will be dutifully unlocked.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut this week's negotiations in Tianjin, a port city near here, have been overshadowed by continued sparring between China and the U.S.\u000a\u000aU.S. officials said China could not expect industrialised nations to take on bigger commitments unless it first agreed to strict measurement and verification of projects, and also took on more than voluntary targets.\u000a\u000aChinese officials have blamed the U.S. for seeking to backtrack from the Kyoto Protocol during the talks, by calling for a substantial amendment. \u201cAny move that aims to overthrow the Kyoto Protocol should be denounced,\u201d chief climate negotiator Su Wei said.\u000a\u000aChina's top climate official Xie Zhenhua earlier called on developed countries to \u201cdo more and do better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe talks have looked like a show going on between China and the U.S., with everyone else hiding behind the drama,\u201d Yang Ailun, Greenpeace China's head of climate and energy, told The Hindu. Ms. Yang, too, said India, along with Brazil and South Africa, had been \u201cvery quiet.\u201d \u201cIt is natural that with the talks being held in China, attention would be on the home country, but the silence of India has been very strange.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia is being represented at the talks by a 15-member delegation, headed by Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Forests J.M. Mauskar. Minister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh arrives in Tianjin on Sunday.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives of climate groups and the media in Tianjin said the delegation had been largely silent this week, leaving much uncertainty over where India stood on issues such as climate finance that have dominated the debate.\u000a\u000aIndia in the past closely coordinated its positions on most issues with China. Their interests and pressures have, however, diverged. China, as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases with 23 per cent of global emissions, was increasingly targeted by developed nations in talks this week. India accounts for only 5 per cent. It, however, stands much to gain \u2014 and lose \u2014from the outcome of this week's debate, particularly on issues such as climate finance.\u000a\u000aIndia, along with other developing nations such as Brazil and South Africa, had failed to take a leading role, analysts said, even as the debate was mired in disagreements between China and the U.S. This marked a contrast from the December climate summit in Copenhagen, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh played a key role in negotiating the compromise Copenhagen Accord, along with U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of China and Brazil.

a((VWhile re-acknowledging that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had erred in projecting the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers due to global warming, R K Pachauri, who chairs the panel, said the agency would unveil a strategy next week on correcting the mistake, besides strengthening the science of tracking climate change.\u000a\u000aWith all the criticism over the mistake, the has decided to bring in editors and coordinating lead authors (CLA) for its fifth assessment report (AR5). The former are to include many of the most established scientists in areas relevant to the assessment. Review editors are independent experts and selected based on lists provided by governments and participating organisations. They do the first review of the report. CLAs supplement the draft revision process and pay special attention to particular points of assessment or areas of major differences and do the second review.\u000a\u000aIn another first, the panel has taken into consideration the nominees\u2019 expertise, geographical and gender balance, and experience with assessments, while selecting the authors and editors. \u201cThe number of nominations to work on AR5 increased 50 per cent to about 3,000. From those, we selected 831 experts, compared with 559 in 2004. These experts were selected from fields including meteorology, engineering, biology, physics, oceanography, statistics and economics and represent a broad diversity of geographic locations and viewpoints,\u201d Pachauri had said.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC, marred with controversies, would not have taken these steps had the (IAC) not made its recommendations to the former last month while evaluating the panel\u2019s functioning. The IAC made these suggestions because of incorrect projection of the disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers by the panel in its Fourth Assessment Report. The 2007 report had said that the \u201clikelihood of (the glaciers) disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate.\u201d But it was later revealed that it was based on a 1999 article which was itself based on speculation, rather than original research. The article had been cited in a 2005 World Wildlife Fund report, which was in turn cited in the volume.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe acknowledge the mistake and the IAC\u2019s suggestions and the report will be discussed next week in Busan (South Korea). The error is there and nothing further can be done about it. The glacier issue will be looked at in the fifth report,\u201d said Pachauri. The AR5 is due in 2013 and 2014.\u000a\u000aLearning from error\u000a\u000aMore, the IAC has suggested a better management structure. The is considering constituting a formal decision-making body to facilitate efficient progress between meetings of the panel, especially on issues such as error correction and questions of scientific integrity, besides improving the responsiveness in urgent situations. Another suggestion the panel is considering is limiting the IPCC chair\u2019s term to the timeframe of one assessment.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the IPCC\u2019s plenary in October, the governments that form the IPCC will carefully review the recommendations of the IAC. It is important to remember that those governments will decide what actions to take. Whatever those actions are, it is clear that the recommendations from the IAC and other organisations will help guide the processes and procedures of the IPCC's future assessments of climate science,\u201d Pachauri had then said.\u000a\u000aThe council had also suggested the panel implement a communications strategy \u201cthat emphasises transparency, rapid and thoughtful responses, and relevance to stakeholders, and which includes guidelines about who can speak on behalf of IPCC and how to represent the organisation appropriately\u201d. To this, the panel says it has increased its investments in clear communication by upgrading the post of communications officer in the secretariat, engaging outside expertise to meet extra demands, and working toward a comprehensive communications strategy.\u000a\u000aBesides, the IAC emphasise engagement of local experts and inclusion of those from countries outside the region on the author teams. \u201cConcerted efforts are being made to encourage broad use of contributing authors with relevant expertise for the region, including experts working outside the region. A separate chapter on \u2018Regional Context\u2019 will help ensure that regional chapter authors and REs understand the strengths and limitations of the available regional climate information,\u201d the panel said.

a((VNEW DELHI: The first signs of rift in the BASIC group -- China, India, South Africa and Brazil -- have surfaced in the on-going climate negotiations. South Africa has put forward a proposal that has caused fissures in the group of four emerging economies, which had trumped Europe in dictating terms at the Copenhagen meet in 2009 and worked as a team.Expressing frustration with the current state of climate talks, South Africa has proposed that all decisions taken at the Cancun talks to be held in December should form part of a single legally binding agreement. China, India and Brazil are not agreeable to it as it could lead to a demise of the Kyoto Protocol and also sound the bugle for the end of the Bali Action Plan. The Bali Action Plan is seen by developing countries as the last remaining firewall between developed and developing countries in climate negotiations.The proposal by South Africa took ominous proportions when other developed countries along with the AOSIS group (Alliance of Small Island States) and some Central American countries -- all seen as close to the US -- in a concerted manner started pushing for a legally binding agreement to become the central pillar of all talks. At Copenhagen, the Basic four had worked ferociously to prevent such a move.India, China and Brazil have been caught unawares with the South African proposal as well as another move by Venezuela suggesting that three categories be created instead of the existing two (developed and other countries) to list out the international commitments towards reducing greenhouse gases -- one for developed countries that have targets under Kyoto Protocol, another for the US and the third for major economies such as India.The moves, if they find favour within the UN talks, could end up easing the pressure on the developed countries to take on strong greenhouse gas emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol or even completely finish it off, instead moving the global climate regime towards a single treaty where India and China are seen as comparable to the developed countries.A meeting of the BASIC ministers is slated for October 11 with a meeting of experts from the four countries preceding it. The BASIC meeting is expected to discuss issues of trade and environment and also discuss if they should agree to a partial agreement on forestry outside the UN convention -- what is known as a `plurilateral agreement' in international diplomacy jargon.US is seen keen to move towards such a process which sidelines the UN negotiations. The US deputy special envoy for climate change, Jonathan Pershing, was reported to have already warned that, "It may mean that we don't use this process (the UN negotiations) exclusively as the way to move forward."His public statement came as a follow up stating that developing countries were stepping back from the Copenhagen Accord signed last year.

a((VOn Sunday,350.org launched its worldwide 10/10/10 (October 10,2010) environmental campaign to inspire people to lower the human carbon footprint. The mission of the campaign was twofold. Firstly to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million (ppm),and to reduce carbon emission by 10 per cent this year and secondly they wanted to send a message to world leaders,“If we can get to work on solutions to the climate crisis,so can you.”\u000a\u000aIn India,350.org had people organising various activities in more than 20 states. In Mumbai,most of the programmes began symbolically at 10.10 am. One was the Butterfly Effect,in which the Sprouts Environment Trust installed a butterfly garden at their office terrace near Malad station. It used compost made of recycled bio-waste to grow plants and vegetables that will provide food as well as increase bio-diversity by attracting diminishing species of butterflies. According to Sprouts Trust,“This demonstrates how even city dwellers can grow food crops in small and confined spaces along with managing their everyday food wastes.”\u000a\u000aOrganisations like the Priyadarshini Park Protectors and Jalebi Ink along with children ran educational campaigns to create awareness on environmental issues. Another organisation,the Bicycle Project,organised a bicycle ride from Bandra to Worli to encourage people to use environmentally friendly forms of transport.\u000a\u000aSimona Terron,a Bicycle Project volunteer,said,“The event is targeting the young and young-at-heart,conscientious folks who care about the environment and want to make a difference.” Anand Pendharkar,Sprouts founder hopes his event will create a genuine “butterfly effect”,one that will show people all over the world how easy it is to manage their own garbage and be environmentally conscious in a way that beautifies all that surrounds them.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App

a((VNEW DELHI: The rift between developing and developed countries further widened at Tianjin, China, with the UN climate negotiations unable to build consensus on what small decisions the UN convention members could possibly agree to as an interim formula at Cancun in December.The talks and public posturing turned more acrimonious with US trying hard to isolate China and changing its goalposts, demanding that the emerging economies should allow a strong regime of international scrutiny of their mitigation actions.China is known to be completely averse to any international scrutiny of greenhouse gas reduction actions that it takes without the financial support of the developed countries.The US, on the other hand, sources said, have now begun asking for parity between the scrutiny of its own actions and that undertaken by emerging economies.At present, under the UN climate convention, only the rich countries are required to undertake international commitments to reduce GHGs. This is done under the Kyoto Protocol, which also sets up a `compliance' mechanism to scrutinise if the actions have been taken and expected reductions in GHGs achieved. But the US has never signed on to the Kyoto Protocol. Developing countries -- emerging economies or not -- are not required to have commitments and consequently are not obligated to submit their actions for international scrutiny.The US stance of demanding equal level of scrutiny of mitigation actions of emerging economies is considered a backdoor route of converting the voluntary actions of countries like China, India, Brazil and South Africa into international commitments.The US has also, sources said, asked that the international scrutiny regime should not only review the aggregate effect of the actions of developing countries but penetrate deeper to study sector-level impacts on emissions.While India is officially opposed to such a move, political flexibility on the issue has always existed in UPA-2. China, on the other hand, is strictly opposed to such intrusive gaze of developed economies.The attempt to push for a common set of rules for review of rich and poor countries is seen as rewriting the UN convention. Under the Copenhagen Accord, the developing countries, especially the BASIC four, had already made a compromise and allowed international consultation and analysis of their domestic actions funded by their money. But the attempt to lower the scrutiny of US actions to that of the emerging economies has only created a stalemate, which may not be resolved by the time the Cancun meet happens.One more minister-level meeting of countries is to be held in Mexico in early November before the final negotiations of the year start in November-end.

a((VWith tree plantings in Australia's biggest city Sydney and gardening near its iconic Bondi Beach, hundreds took part on Sunday in what organisers say will be the world's biggest day of climate change action.\u000a\u000aThe 10/10/2010 event known as the "Global Work Party" kicked off in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific and is set to spin its way across the globe via more than 7,000 community events in 188 countries. "The only countries that aren't taking part, we think, are Equatorial Guinea, San Marino, North Korea so it's clearly the most widespread day of environmental action," co-founder of the 350.org campaign Bill McKibben said.\u000a\u000a"And as far as we can tell, the most widespread day of civic engagement on any issue ever in the planet's history."\u000a\u000aThe events come as long-running United Nations efforts to broker a global deal on tackling the issue have stalled, and McKibben said while organisers had feared that people would be disillusioned by this, the opposite was true.\u000a\u000a"People are discouraged but they are taking out their frustrations in action," he told AFP via telephone from Washington.\u000a\u000a"They have decided that we are going to have to show our leaders what leadership looks like." In Australia, the call for practical action resulted in gardeners sharing tips on going green, bicycle rides to urge less use of carbon-polluting cars, the planting of trees and public talks on reducing household emissions.\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest events Down Under is expected to be a protest at a coal-fired power plant in Hazelwood, Victoria, in which hundreds of demonstrators are planning to carry models of solar panels.\u000a\u000aIn the Pacific, every island is taking part in the event, from the "no car" campaign in Tonga to cycling events in Papua New Guinea, tree planting in tropical Fiji and gardening in New Zealand, coordinator Aaron Packard said.\u000a\u000a"Often I find the issue of climate change pretty depressing when you look into the details of it," he said. "But the thing that really gives me hope is the way the people of the Pacific have responded. It's just incredible because you know darn well they have done so little to contribute to climate change but they are some of the most vocal, the most willing, to get to work and do really inspiring things."\u000a\u000aThe 350.org campaign, named for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that scientists say is the safe limit for humanity, is spearheading the actions around the world that take in Afghanistan, Russia and China. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, war refugees will plant a "Forest of Hope" while in Iraq, students will install solar panels on the roof of the University of Babylon.\u000a\u000aMore than 1,200 events are planned for the United States, and in China some 30,000 students will help launch the "Great Green Initiative" which local organisers say is "the largest grassroots, youth-led environmental campaign in China".

a((VMeghalayas capital city, Shillong, has undergone substantialchangesin its climate pattern. With urbanisation, Shillongs problems like water shortage, inadequacy of sanitation and civic services, choked roads, and a degraded urban environment have compounded. In an initiative to raise awareness on climate change, a radio jockey, popularly known as Bah Manik, is tirelessly spreading the message of abandoning plastic use through his popular programme Hei Kapla. He has emerged as one of the states most knowledgeable and passionate communicators about the urgent need to address climate change.\u000a\u000aTaking a cue from the efforts of people like Bah Manik, the Indian business houses can best utilise the current times to dedicate efforts towards mitigating climate change. It is time for them to earn kudos for acting for the environment. They need to check emissions of harmful substances from their manufacturing units in ways that doesnt hamper growth and expansion. They should embark upon ways to bring in efficiency through optimal use of resources by adopting environment friendly mechanisms.\u000a\u000aClimate change hits India hard in terms of costs and livelihoods disrupted, even though India accounts for just about 4% of the worlds greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Historically, the responsibility of GHG emissions rested largely with the industrialised world, but developing countries are likely to be the source of an increasing portion of future emissions. As the global economic recession has proven, every crisis brings with it an adversity and opportunity. The one who makes the most of the opportunity in the face of adversity would emerge as the true winner.\u000a\u000aSomething similar can be said about global warming. It poses a threat to our planet while providing an opportunity to humankind to understand, change and evolve. The threat is in terms of the severe impacts that climate change will have on ecosystems, sea level, crop production and weather patterns.\u000a\u000aThis, in turn, will lead to increased international pressure on nations as well as corporations across all industries. They will be subject to increasingly stringent environment regulations as well as sustained pressure from customers, employees and investors to deliver on a triple bottom line of social, economic and environmental performance. The opportunity comes in the form of a driving force for Indian companies to discover new technologies, processes, means and strategies to not only meet their business goals but also keep emissions under check.

A major door to door plastic collection drive in Assolna and similar initiatives on a smaller scale in Sancoale and Campal turned out to be an eye-opener for the people."We planned to cover 2 km from Campal to Miramar, but we could barely clear 200 metres of the newly formed beach opposite old GMC ," Pankaj Kudtarkar, a volunteer said. It was a carpet of plastic, glass and thermacol all the way and ten volunteers found it difficult to plod through heaps of it.In Assolna, the villagers loaded four tempos with plastic waste and two more with other wastes in a collection drive lasting five and half hours. "We knew we could barely manage plastic waste and would have needed more manpower for other garbage," Francis Braz, a participant said.The clean up drive co-ordinated by Nelson Fernandes commenced on Saturday with the help of scouts and guides of the Assolna church school in coordination with the headmistress and others. More than 80 plastic bags were filled with non-biodegradable waste near the school during the clean-up. "The villagers were sensitized on the issue by the parish priest and announcements were made through the public address system," Braz said.There are a few lessons for everybody, especially the younger generation about the menace of plastic, he added. "Once segregated, we can manage it. And awareness at school level is important to sensitize children," Braz added.Starting from the newly formed beach opposite old GMC building, the volunteers collected plastic, thermacol and glass waste, filling 15 bags with it. "It was not possible to go any further as every square metre of space was dotted with lots of waste," another participant said. "The waste was segregated and given to the recycler," Kudtarkar said.

They argue import tariffs are needed to offset the loss of competitiveness industries in countries that accept binding targets are likely to face. This claim is also being backed by the World Trade Organisation.\u000a\u000aThe Basic group of countries \u2014 India, China, Brazil and South Africa \u2014 called it a \u201cunilateral protectionist measure\u201d and rejected it on Monday at a meeting in Tainjin, China.\u000a\u000a\u201c(Basic) ministers rejected the notion of unilateral actions against products and services of developing countries on grounds of combating climate change, which will jeopardise international collaboration on climate change and international trade,\u201d said a resolution adopted by the ministers.\u000a\u000aThe text, which India first proposed in 2009, says developed nations \u201cshall not resort to any form of unilateral measures including countervailing border measures, against goods and services imported from developing countries on grounds of protection of climate\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe would like this text to be reflected in the final (climate) agreement,\u201d Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said at the meeting attended by officials from Yemen, Ethiopia, Venezuela, Argentina and Egypt.\u000a\u000aIndia has said such moves would violate the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

a((VWith less than two months to go for the year-ending annual climate change conference — this time to be held in the Mexican beach resort of Cancun in November-December — there is little clarity on what the meeting should realistically aim to achieve.\u000a\u000aUnlike last year in Copenhagen,when the goal of reaching a comprehensive and global agreement on climate change was the stated objective till the very end — notwithstanding the fact that everyone realised it was not going to be possible — the countries this year have very divergent hopes from the meeting. Some just want a set of decisions to come out of the meeting while others are hoping for a more ambitious outcome.\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop,the ministers of the four large emerging economies — Brazil,South Africa,India and China,which together have formed a powerful bloc known as the BASIC group — on Monday met in the Chinese city of Tianjin to discuss their strategy for the meeting. A joint statement issued after the meeting said the Cancun conference must aim for an outcome that would pave the way for a global legally-binding agreement at the next meeting in South Africa in 2011.\u000a\u000aThe meeting urged the rich countries — held predominantly responsible for causing climate change — to take on more ambitious targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions for a period beyond 2012 when their current emission reduction commitments under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol come to an end. The joint statement also called on the US,which has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol and does not have any emission reduction commitment,to take “comparable” targets for the future.\u000a\u000aWhile discussing the pressures being brought on them by the rich countries,the BASIC group rejected all attempts to link trade restrictions with climate change goals. Their joint statement said any notion of unilateral actions by the developed countries against products and services of the developing world on grounds of combating climate change will be rejected and such attempts would seriously jeopardise collaboration on both climate negotiations as well as international trade.\u000a\u000aIn a bid to unite all the developing countries,which have at present grouped themselves in different blocs,the ministers of BASIC nations had invited representatives from a large number of other countries for the meeting. The joint statement therefore incorporated the concerns of these countries as well.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VUrging the developed countries to fulfil the obligation of providing the developing nations with $30 billion, the group of countries, formed by Brazil, South Africa, India and China, today said this fast-start financing should be made available as soon as possible in a transparent manner.\u000a\u000aThe fund was promised for 2012 at last year\u2019s and the developed nations had also pledged to secure $100 billion annually till 2020.\u000a\u000aThe group agreed that mid- and long-term financial support provided by the developed nations would also determine the outcome of the Cancun climate change summit, to be held next month.\u000a\u000aIt also affirmed its full support for the establishment of a new fund under the (UNFCCC) by the developed nations, to be funded by public money and not private, as suggested by the rich countries.\u000a\u000aBesides, they also rejected the developed nations\u2019 proposal of unilateral actions against products and services of developing nations on the grounds of combating climate change, including tax and non-tax, or other fiscal and non-fiscal border or other measures.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is against the principles and provisions of UNFCCC and will seriously jeopardise international pact on climate change and global trade,\u201d the ministers said.\u000a\u000aThey emphasised the importance of the issue of equitable access to sustainable development as a central element in building a comprehensive and balanced outcome for climate change negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201c ministers focused their discussions on issues in relation to the Cancun conference, and expressed their determination to facilitate a comprehensive and balanced outcome in Cancun in accordance with the mandate of the Bali Roadmap,\u201d said a joint statement issued at the end of the 5th Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey expressed concern with the lack of transparency and the relevant information on fast start finance and reiterated that these resources must be new and additional to the existing ODA (Official Development Assistance) and bilateral funds,\u201d the statement said.\u000a\u000aThe meeting was attended by environment ministers of Yemen, Argentina, Grenada, Ethiopia and Egypt and the ministers emphasized that the outcome in Cancun should pave the way for a legally binding outcome next year in South Africa.\u000a\u000aFurther, they said that \u201cthe outcome of Cancun conference should be based on the balance between and within the two negotiating tracks under UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, and that it should be open, transparent, inclusive, party driven and based on consensus.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey group also urged developed countries to commit to more ambitious emission reduction targets under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The ministers called for developed countries that did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol to undertake comparable emission reduction targets under the Convention.\u000a\u000a\u201cMinisters underscored the importance attached to developed countries fulfilling their obligations of technology transfer and agreed that intellectual property rights should not be allowed to become a barrier to technology transfer,\u201d said the statement.

a((VNEW DELHI: India will push for R K Pachauri to continue as the chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) while it debates the fifth assessment report at the IPCC meeting in Busan, South Korea thatstarted on Monday. New Delhi will also press for the immediate implementation of all the other reforms that the InterAcademy Council review has sought.Though the Council had recommended that the "the term of the IPCC Chair should be limited to the timeframe of one assessment", and Pachauri has already headed one such assessment report, which was released in 2007, the Indian government plans to back the director of The Energy Research Institute (TERI) at the meeting.But, the Indian representatives at the meeting will ask for immediate implementation of all the other reforms of the committee set up after the Himalayan glacier scandal that had dented the IPCC's reputation earlier this year.So far, the IPCC has provided four comprehensive assessment reports of which the last -- referred to as AR4 -- was the most high profile, and helped take the debate on climate change beyond the scientific community. In 2009, though the IPCC was awarded the Nobel prize, it got embroiled in controversy this year, with concerns about veracity of some of its findings being challenged.The Busan meet aims to clear the agenda for the fifth assessment report, which includes reviewing the recommendations of the InterAcademy Council report. The Council has recommended several structural changes in the IPCC as well as strengthening of the processes by which scientific facts are included in the final report.The other controversial recommendation of the Council to the IPCC -- not to venture into policy recommendations --- will also come up for a crucial debate as the fifth assessment report promises to dwell more into its normative end than the earlier ones.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe BASIC group of large developing nations \u2013 India, China, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 on Monday intensified their efforts to win the crucial support of small island States on the climate change debate ahead of the year-end U.N. summit at Cancun in Mexico.\u000a\u000aTheir attempts, however, faced hurdles, with persistent differences on emission reduction targets between the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the BASIC countries.\u000a\u000aThe AOSIS has emerged as a key voice in the climate debate, given the particular susceptibility of small islands to the consequences of climate change and rising sea-levels.\u000a\u000aThe West, in the past, used the interests of the AOSIS countries to pressure large developing nations like China and India to take on greater commitments.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives from Grenada, current chair of the AOSIS, attended a two-day meeting of the BASIC group, which concluded here on Monday.\u000a\u000aMinister for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said, Grenada's attendance, and contribution to a statement released on Monday, was \u201ca very positive development.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe most important thing is the statement has been brought out by not just the BASIC group, but other countries as well, including representatives of the AOSIS who greatly contributed to this meeting,\u201d he told The Hindu.\u000a\u000aDifferences\u000a\u000aThe statement, however, suggested continuing differences between the BASIC and the AOSIS. The AOSIS has been calling for a climate deal that would limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees centigrade by 2050.\u000a\u000aThe BASIC, however, wants a 2 degree cap, citing the need for the developing countries to be able to continue their growth, and the absence of any agreement with developed nations on equity in using carbon space. The small island States have argued that their very survival is at stake.\u000a\u000aThe final BASIC statement reflects some of those differences, saying that the Ministers \u201creaffirmed their support for the aspirational objective of keeping global temperature increase well below 2 ºC,\u201d but also \u201crecognised diversity of views on more ambitious aspirational objectives.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt said, \u201cThe resolution to this issue links directly to reaching a political understanding of equity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe AOSIS is sticking to the 1.5 degree [cap],\u201d Mr. Ramesh said. \u201cBut the fact that they are talking to us is very, very important.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir support, he said, was crucial, given that \u201cEuropean and Western countries have been using the AOSIS\u201d to put pressure on India and China.\u000a\u000aGrenada has invited Mr. Ramesh, along with China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua, to a meeting with the AOSIS representatives on the island on November 1.\u000a\u000aRe-connecting with G77\u000a\u000aTo secure the support of the AOSIS and African countries, China has been promoting a \u201cBASIC-plus\u201d approach, to expand the influence of the BASIC group within the G77.\u000a\u000aMr. Xie recently told The Hindu that China believed that expanding the negotiating block was needed to bring on board the AOSIS and less developed countries, whose interests diverged with the BASIC group at Copenhagen.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is more effective to include different countries for different issues,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThis attempt to find common ground with other developing countries, which form the larger bloc of the Group of 77, was also reflected in the statement, where \u201cMinisters reiterated that the BASIC as part of the Group of 77 and China will continue to work and strengthen the unity of the Group, and play a constructive role in facilitating climate change negotiations.\u201d

a((VAs I rush out from the elevator, I am greeted by Dario Schworer who tells me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take the stairs?\u201d I promise to use the stairs instead of escalators and elevators in future and then I begin an hour-long conversation with this environmentalist, climatologist, qualified ski and mountaineering guide about his family \u2014 wife Sabine, a nurse and three children Salina, Andri and Noe \u2014 and their awe-inspiring journey across the world to spread one message \u2014 living in harmony with nature. It\u2019s been eight years since they kickstarted their ToptoTop Global Climate Expedition in 2002. TOPtoTOP is a non profit organisation under the patronage of the United Nations Environment Program and Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u201cThroughout our journey hitherto, we have come across thousands of people who believe that climate change is not a problem at all; especially people living in the cities who are averse to doing anything about it as they aren\u2019t directly affected,\u201d says Dario. But he and his wife did realise the impact. \u201cSabine and I decided to embark on this expedition in 2002, when we saw the impact climate change was having on the Alps. We first tried to climb all major summits in Switzerland, which later snowballed into this journey of climbing the tallest summit in each of the seven continents.\u201d Leading by example, the family, in order to minimise their carbon footprints, walks, cycles and sails their way to every destination.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSailing to save the climate\u000a\u000aTheir sailboat \u2013 Pachamama \u2013 means \u2018much more than mother earth\u2019 and signifies a lifestyle in harmony with nature. It is a vessel that uses renewable energy. Till date the family has sailed over 70,000 kms, climbed 4,00,000 vertical metres and cycled over 18,000 kms.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThey hope that their initiative encourages people to travel by foot whenever possible or use bicycles more often as regular means of transport. \u201cChildren are our future and our mission is to inspire young people to work towards a more sustainable future. We hope more and more people join us and make individual efforts towards protecting the environment,\u201d says Dario. Which is why, everywhere they go, the family makes it a point to meet schoolchildren, in addition to companies that promote eco-friendly practices and members of the corporate world to share their experiences, the message of environment conservation and connect with the local community.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDario and his family\u2019s clean-up drives in mountains are anything but a glaring example of the amount of damage humans are inflicting upon the environment. Till date, the family has collected more than 22 tonnes of garbage on their mountain expeditions! \u201cParticipating in sports is important but how many of us do it without causing any damage to the environment?\u201d he remarks. His vision is that TOPtoTOP becomes a lasting platform which brings active people closer to nature and sports.\u000a\u000aAnd life hasn\u2019t been easy. Dario and Sabine with just $2000 in their pocket, set out in 2002 to do what they believed in. There were nights when they had to clean dishes in restaurants and survive on whatever food they could get their hands on, but with each year passing by, they have evolved to be more optimistic individuals. \u201cA few years back, everyone began to voice concerns about the issue of climate change. It\u2019s been years since the world has been introduced to the problem. What we want to do is not highlight the problem but suggest solutions,\u201d says Dario.\u000a\u000aHe adds that people aren\u2019t sensitised enough towards climate change and its hazardous impacts. \u201cThere is this huge gap between rural and urban areas in India especially. \u201cDuring our interactions with people in cities, they say things like \u2018why should we care\u2019; why should we change?\u2019 This leaves us flummoxed. The adverse affects are right in front of us. Take Bangalore for example, a few years back, Bangaloreans never needed any air conditioners to survive in the city. Now they do! If this isn\u2019t a warning sign, what else is?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDario says that change starts from an individual. \u201cIndia has this huge population, if each citizen does something, brings that little change in their lifestyle, imagine the breakthrough!\u201d says Dario. But what about the cynics I say - people who argue that cycling to work or taking the bus is not a practical option, that carpooling doesn\u2019t help much? Dario answers immediately, \u201cIt might be difficult to start with but if everyone considers the long term benefits of such moves, it is definitely worth the effort. If you can\u2019t avoid taking your car to work, walk short distances; instead of taking your two-wheeler to the supermarket, walk or cycle the distance; take the stairs instead of using elevators in malls and use public transport; install solar panels on roofs or heaters instead of using electrical geysers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI make a note, thanks Dario; walk out of the room; walk down to the stairs and on my way to the nearest bus stop. As Dario says, \u201cThe change needs to begin with you.\u201d

a((VUpdated: Tue, Oct 12 2010. 11 55 PM IST\u000a\u000aR. Chidambaram, principal scientific adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and a former director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, spoke in an interview about plans to develop technologies for the next generation of power plants, as well as implications of the recent approval of the Civil Nuclear Liability Bill. Edited excerpts:\u000a\u000aIndia has been planning to start work on the advanced ultra super critical power generation equipment.\u000a\u000aThe government already has a super critical programme in place. But the idea here is to have an advanced ultra super critical programme. All this depends on the steam pressure and the temperatures we can achieve. The higher we go in these, the greater the efficiency we can achieve. The programme we are thinking of is to bring together the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), which has a great deal of experience with fast breeder reactors and materials developed. Then, of course, we have NTPC Ltd, India\u2019s largest power utility, and then, of course, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel).\u000a\u000aThe first step we have taken is to have an MoU (memorandum of understanding). IGCAR will be involved in the science and core technologies, NTPC will field test materials and be involved with the project management. Bhel will develop capabilities for developing the large generators and turbines needed. If these come together, we can come up with the first prototype plant by 2017.\u000a\u000aWe are told that the total investment for this is nearly Rs8,000 crore. Where is the funding going to come from?\u000a\u000aAll that we have to see. I\u2019m only talking about the science part. Let\u2019s get our science right, and that\u2019s a very crucial step because (the) higher the efficiency we achieve, the lower our carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt, and the development will have implications for all the other things. The money part will come.\u000a\u000aIs India developing all the core technologies required for this by itself?\u000a\u000aYes, all the core technologies. But today, nobody can overwhelm India in matters of technology. If we need something from outside, it\u2019s available, and we\u2019ll bring it from there so that we have control over the entire technology.\u000a\u000aOnce this technology is in place, do we have nearly 50% of our future orders based on advanced ultra supercritical technologies?\u000a\u000aOnce this is successful, of course. It is better than super critical.\u000a\u000aDo we know where the prototype is going to be located?\u000a\u000aNot yet. We\u2019ll take a decision on this shortly.\u000a\u000aYou have been closely involved with discussions around the National Knowledge Network. Where are we on it?\u000a\u000aThe initial phase of the National Knowledge Network was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in April, and a few months back, the entire project was cleared by the cabinet committee on infrastructure. Parts of the project, such as virtual classroom and inter-connections between several IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) have already been achieved. In the next phase, we will be connecting most of the universities. The CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) labs will be connected and once you have this kind of gigabit connectivity, teaching as well as research are going to be much better. Suppose you are developing some component for the fast breeder reactor and it involves the IGCAR and other universities, any change in design, etc., can be quickly implemented.\u000a\u000aRecently, Parliament cleared the civil nuclear liability Bill. How will this impact and change India\u2019s nuclear industry?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t want to get into those details. I think these things will work out on their own. There is a nuclear renaissance taking place in the world driven by the energy security needs of India and China. Independent of the threat of climate change, there is not enough fossil fuel for India or China to consume fossil fuels at the levels which already developed countries are doing. We have to look for alternate sources of energy and nuclear is a major source. Different countries are gearing up in different ways.\u000a\u000aI went to Abu Dhabi recently and they are developing a nuclear plant. They don\u2019t want to be dependent on that one source (fossil fuel). In countries which have seen a steady growth, knowledge management has not been a problem. Young people have been joining the field. In developed countries where growth has stagnated, there\u2019s an entire young generation that has not been working in this field. Such countries would look to partner countries like India. That\u2019s primarily because of the sheer quality of the human resource. Also, the cost of manufacturing in India can be brought down. So there are going to be collaborations in not just supply, but also manufacturing.\u000a\u000aWill this mean that organizations such as BARC will expand their workforce?\u000a\u000aYes, that can and will be done. As of now, the number of people who are joining BARC are a minor fraction of those who apply.\u000a\u000ajacob.k@livemint.com

a((VIndia will spend $2.3 trillion to boost its energy sector by 2030 by improving energy efficiency and using clean technology to help Asias third largest economy balance growth and environmental aims.\u000a\u000aWhile the country will need to keep burning cheaper fossil fuel to expand the reach of electricity to half of its one-billion-plus population without power, relying on conventional energy alone would be unsustainable as reserves deplete and costs rise.\u000a\u000aAnd being the worlds third-worst carbon emitter only makes it imperative to shift to a greener economy, BK Chaturvedi, a member of Planning Commission, said.\u000a\u000aWe should develop this in the context of a two-pronged strategy: The first is improving energy efficiency, and the second is changing the mix of the energy which we consume, Chaturvedi said.\u000a\u000aHe said the country plans to spend $2.3 trillion on the energy sector by 2030, which will include a substantial burden for expanding the countrys energy basket to include green sources such as solar, wind and nuclear power.\u000a\u000aSome of it will be towards energy consumption, but a lot of it will go towards improving energy efficiency and improving the composition of energy, Chaturvedi said. This cost will have to be borne by the economy. He did not mention what portion of the amount would be spent on making the shift to a green economy in the next two decades.\u000a\u000aGoing green\u000a\u000aThe country last year set a goal for slowing the growth of its emissions, saying it will try to rein in its carbon intensity the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of GDP by between 20% and 25% by 2020, from 2005 levels.\u000a\u000aChaturvedi said target was doable, and that thrust for efficiency was being laid on power, transport and industry among a slew of energy-intensive sectors.\u000a\u000aHe said the government had set up a panel on transport sector efficiency which would submit its report by early next year. We are taking measures for improving the energy efficiency of cars, and setting up the dedicated freight corridor so that we are able to expand goods faster, he said.\u000a\u000aWe are trying to move to increase the share of rail transport from 30% to around 50-60%. In developing that you require a lot of investment in the rail sector.\u000a\u000aPower remains a top priority in terms of increasing energy efficiency and use of renewables as well.\u000a\u000aIndia aims to add about 100 gigawatts (gw) of power generation capacity by early 2017, much of it from coal, despite conceding it would miss by 79% an earlier five-year target of adding 78.7 gw by March 2012. The country aims to almost triple the use of hydro power by 2032 and that of nuclear by almost six times during the same period, which could help India slow the growth of its emissions.\u000a\u000aGame changing technology\u000a\u000aAdditionally, it hopes to generate 10.5 gw of wind power by 2012 and 20 gw of solar power by 2022, as part of plans to lift the contribution of green power sources to Indias energy mix to about 20% by 2020. Just about 6% of the countrys total power mix now comes from renewables.\u000a\u000aBut Chaturvedi said renewables were still expensive energy and that it was important to develop technology to cut costs.\u000a\u000aHe, however, warned the world was still awaiting game changing green technologies. Things are coming up, but these are not game-changers, he said, adding the private sector was key in developing research.\u000a\u000aWhat we are doing is trying to see how we can use or adapt these (Western) technologies, and pick up some of the other areas of energy efficiency to invest these funds.

a((VPUNE: City-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has come together with the European Union (EU) for a project to understand the variability of monsoon in India over the last three years."The tie-up began in 2008 and is part of the Indo-EU collaboration on fighting climate change in India that took shape in 2004. Scientists from both parties are trying to find out the reason behind the huge variation in the monsoon season as witnessed in the country between 2008 and 2010," said officials of the British High Commission here on Wednesday.The Reading University in the United Kingdom (UK), the European Centre for medium-range forecasting, the Hadley Centre of UK Meteorological Office are part of the project which is being co-ordinated by the IITM.IITM scientist K Krishna Kumar, who is coordinating the project in India, said, "We are trying to explore various matters related to monsoon. In the last few years, the country has been seeing drastic variations during this season. For example, we will try to understand why there was drought in India in 2009 and a fairly good monsoon this year."Kumar also said, "The fluctuating monsoon season in India will be studied along with the global phenomenon and its impact on the Indian monsoon. We are trying to find out this link and EU experts will be helpful on this front. Weather is fluid and nothing happens in isolation. For instance, some weather phenomenon in one part of the world will invariably have a cascading effect on other parts. Though, the monsoon variations in our country are undoubtedly a local occurrence, but they do have a global connection."The project is in its second phase, and two research students have been sent to UK to attain their doctorate in one of the climate change topics, the officials said, adding "Broadly, we are also undertaking various monsoon predictions projects, such as vegetation of India during the monsoon, predicting the monsoon about 15 to 20 days in advance, among other things."Meanwhile, Kumar said UK has earlier also been involved in research pertaining to monsoon in India. "It is out of mutual interest that we strive to understand increase in the green-house effects on global warming and what will be its impact on monsoon."

Robin, Anindya Sinha and Uma Ramakrishnan of the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore, and National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, reveals that the Western Ghats, the Palghat Gap and the Shencottah Gap, both of which provide major rail and road connectivity across the Western Ghats between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, caused a break in the populations of the species.\u000a\u000aMillion years' story\u000a\u000aThe populations across the Palghat Gap got separated 5 million years ago, and the Nilgiris and Anamalai hills, to the north and south of the gap, harbour two different species of the white-bellied shortwing. Across the Shencottah Gap, the populations were separated about 2 million years ago.\u000a\u000aThe researchers argue that the single species of white-bellied shortwing should be split into two different species \u2014 white-bellied shortwing and rufous-bellied shortwing on either side of the Palghat Gap. These were the names used earlier by ornithologist Salim Ali.\u000a\u000aThey are of the view that glacial cycles, especially the ice ages, may also have played an important role in splitting these species.\u000a\u000aIce Age impact\u000a\u000aDuring the Ice Age, the tropical regions got drier, driving species adapted to wet-forest conditions higher up into the mountains where they then became isolated. The most recent ice age about 20,000 years ago had also impacted these species.\u000a\u000aThese isolated populations on mountaintops were severely affected as the forests shrunk drastically and they went through a massive population decline.\u000a\u000aWhen the Ice Age ended and the forests recovered, the survivors of the species multiplied to the current population, according to the researchers.\u000a\u000aHigh elevation species are strongly affected by climatic change.\u000a\u000aAs it gets warmer, these species move higher up on mountains and face greater threat of extinction due to global warming. But the climate has been changing since millennia.\u000a\u000aHowever, the DNA of the species retains signatures of past population changes. Genetic tools can then be used to understand species response to past climate change, they said.\u000a\u000aThe study reveals how species respond to changes in climate based on their ecology. Such information will help predict how species may respond to future climate change allowing more targeted conservation.\u000a\u000aThe focus is on how the species got to these island mountain tops of the Ghats and the extent of relatedness among populations on different islands, they said.

a((VA plant which was originally found in warmer regions of Uttar Pradesh has gradually migrated to higher elevations of 1,300 metres in the Himalayan regions in the last fifty years, indicating the impact of climate change, scientists have said.\u000a\u000a"It appears that S Anthemifolia is responding to the changing climatic conditions and showing an uphill movement pattern. Studies on its habitat requirements and dispersal mechanisms therefore become important," researchers have said as they kept track on its migrating pattern.\u000a\u000aOriginally, a native of South America and Australia, Soliva anthemifolia, a diffuse, creeping, stoloniferous herb was reported for the first time in 1963 from Uttar Pradesh at an altitude of 630 metres is now observed in Palampur in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 1300 metres, they said.\u000a\u000aAnd since Palampur has shown an increase of 0.6°C in temperature over the last three decades, ie 1978\u20132008 and is also a relatively wet place that receives substantial rainfall, both the factors are favourable for the mesic habitat-loving species of the warm regions.\u000a\u000aTracing the plant's dramatic growth movement, the experts noted that in 1966, its extended distribution northward into the Himalayan states was reported from Dehradun (now in Uttarakhand), where it was growing at an altitude of 640 metres.\u000a\u000aIn 1973, it was reported as new addition to the flora of Delhi. Later, its extension to Jammu, where the plant was collected from an altitude of 400\u2013700 metres, was reported.\u000a\u000aThe plant was also reported from Rajasthan and Haryana. Soon after, the plant was observed growing along water channels at an altitude of more than 1000 metres in the Patti locality of Himachal Pradesh.\u000a\u000a"It should be noted that the higher limit of its distribution in the Himalayas has been mentioned to be 1000 metres. Subsequently, the plant has now been observed in Palampur at an altitude of 1300 metres," said the team of researchers Sanjay Uniyal, Om Parkash and RD Singh, from a leading organisation, Institute of Himalayan Bioresource (CSIR) in Palampur.\u000a\u000a"This area is frequently visited by us and we had also not encountered this plant in our earlier surveys, until the recent one," the authors noted in their study published in latest edition of Current Science journal.\u000a\u000aVarious studies have warned that the change in the length of growing season and their severity will dramatically affect food supply and potential for food security.

He said the government had set up a panel on transport sector efficiency which would submit its report by early next year.\u201cWe are taking measures for improving the energy efficiency of cars, and setting up the dedicated freight corridor so that we are able to expand goods faster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to move to increase the share of rail transport from 30 per cent to around 50-60 per cent. In developing that you require a lot of investment in the rail sector.\u201dPower remains a top priority in terms of increasing energy efficiency and use of renewables as well. India aims to add about 100 gigawatts (Gw) of power generation capacity by early 2017, much of it from coal, despite conceding it would miss by 79 per cent an earlier five-year target of adding 78.7 Gw by March 2012.India aims to almost triple the use of hydro power by 2032 and that of nuclear by almost six times during the same period, which could help India slow the growth of its emissions.Additionally, India hopes to generate 10.5 Gw of wind power by 2012 and 20 Gw of solar power by 2022, as part of plans to lift the contribution of \u201cgreen\u201d power sources to India\u2019s energy mix to about 20 per cent by 2020. Just about six per cent of India\u2019s total power mix now comes from renewables.But Chaturvedi said renewables were still expensive energy and that it was important to develop technology to cut costs.He, however, warned the world was still awaiting \u201cgame changing\u201d green technologies.\u201cThings are coming up, but these are not game-changers,\u201d he said, adding the private sector was key in developing research.\u201cWhat we are doing is trying to see how we can use or adapt these (Western) technologies, and pick up some of the other areas of energy efficiency to invest these funds.\u201d

a((VThe UN Secretary General recently announced the setting up of a high-level Panel on Global Sustainability, tasked with \u201crethinking the development paradigm in a low-carbon world\u201d. Humanity is already living beyond the earth\u2019s ability to sustain it, threatening the Millennium Development Goals of achieving food security, eradicating poverty and reaching education to all. It explicitly categorises current development paths as \u2018outdated\u2019.\u000a\u000aTwenty-three years ago, a similar group headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland produced Our Common Future, a document heralded as a major step in the direction of sustainable development. This was followed by Agenda 21 in 1992, meant to lead the world into sustainability by the 21st century. Both of these, however, have been largely consigned to history\u2019s dustbin, with the world headed towards even greater ecological collapse and socio-economic inequity. Will this new initiative break away from this trend?\u000a\u000aInterestingly, Brundtland is a member of the new panel, as is our Minister of State for Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh. Headed by the current premiers of Finland and South Africa, the panel contains several other heads or former heads of state and a few scientists.\u000a\u000aWhat should such a panel conceive of that can take humans away from their current headlong trajectory into ecological suicide? And how should it do so?\u000a\u000aTo begin with, the panel needs to acknowledge that we can no longer afford to tinker around with purely technical solutions to the challenges confronting us. Whether it is climate change or biodiversity loss, conflicts or poverty, the causes are not technical or technological but an unsustainable and irresponsible path of \u2018development\u2019 in which the earth\u2019s elements are simply raw material, ecosystems are sinks for our wastes and people are labour or consumers to be exploited. Other causes include an elite minority that wants to consume more, stoked by powerful corporations and corrupt governments that benefit from this craving. Current patterns of energy and materials use and unregulated global trade and financial transactions are other forces driving unsustainability and inequality.\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly some of the answers will be technological or managerial, for instance in adopting the latest energy-efficient materials and construction, renewables and fuel-efficient public transportation. Sustainable farming and fisheries are well established around the world. Decentralised water harvesting for villages and cities is a no-brainer.\u000a\u000aBut the bigger picture is in fundamental changes in governance and development paradigms. We need a deeper form of democracy in which each citizen has the right and the capacity to participate in decision-making that affects her life. Such decisions need to be based on the twin imperatives of ecological sensitivity and social equity. As part of this Radical Ecological Democracy, contrary to current economic globalisation policies, each local settlement (rural or urban) is empowered to take decisions for its environment. It can be connected to institutions at ever-increasing scales, for management of larger landscapes defined by ecological boundaries and political and cultural ones. At the international level, the environment and human rights instruments that most countries are signatory to, need to be given the kind of teeth that World Trade Organisation and other economic instruments currently enjoy. Financial markets have to be reined in. The UN system should become a United Nations of Peoples, reducing the role of nation-states and bringing back the role of peoples and communities. Curbs have to be put on the runaway consumerism of the rich.\u000a\u000aAt the heart of the situation is a change in values: from competition to cooperation, from individual profit to social good, from homogeneity to diversity. It is also a change in indicators of welfare and prosperity: from material accumulations to health and well-being, food and water security, happiness, stable social relations and education.\u000a\u000aTo evolve such paradigms, the UN panel must adopt a consultative public process. It has to learn from the thousands of experiments already showing results. It would have to hear the world\u2019s indigenous and other traditional communities, whose lives are often far more sustainable than those of \u2018global\u2019 metropolitan citizens. The panel, however, does not have representatives of such communities.\u000a\u000aThe task before the panel is difficult and complex, but not impossible. We can only hope that the panel is able to show the courage and leadership needed to facilitate the voices of sanity spread across the world, and synthesise them into breakthrough visions of global sustainability.\u000a\u000aAshish Kothari is with Kalpavriksh Environmental Action Group.

Such an effort will help implement pension and other welfare programmes. Besides, we can increase recycling work and produce bio gas from the organic waste with the help of this money," said Gaikwad recalling her speech at the UN convention."The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN will be helpful for us in this fund raising," she said, adding, "right now the CDM finances private companies that burn waste. This burning leads to pollution. Instead, this waste could be recycled and composted. We will be able to do that and make our contribution to the fight against climate change."Gaikwad also put up the demand for an identity cards for waste pickers. "I-cards will help us carry out our work more safely," she added.A city-based NGO Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (KKPKP), was associated with the arrangements of the tour. The organisation too has vouched for a CDM for waste pickers.According to Nalini Shekar of KKPKP, recycling reduces emissions from deforestation, mining, manufacturing, transport and disposal. "The waste pickers' work has not got enough attention on the international platform. This picture should change. These people have made a lot of contribution in solid waste management," she said.

a((VWith climate change taking its toll on Earth, rock avalanches and landslides have become more common in high mountain ranges over the last decade.\u000a\u000aThe collapses are caused by melting glaciers and permafrost, which remove the glue that binds steep mountain slopes together.\u000a\u000aHowever, the worse part may be to come. Thinning glaciers on volcanoes could destabilize vast chunks of their summit cones, triggering mega-landslides capable of flattening cities such as Seattle and devastating local infrastructure.\u000a\u000aTo assess the risk, Daniel Tormey of ENTRIX, an environmental consultancy based in Los Angeles, studied a huge landslide that occurred 11,000 years ago on Planchón-Peteroa.\u000a\u000aHe focused on this glaciated volcano in Chile because its altitude and latitude make it likely to feel the effects of climate change before others.\u000a\u000a"Around one-third of the volcanic cone collapsed," Tormey says. Ten billion cubic metres of rock crashed down the mountain and smothered 370 square kilometres of land, travelling 95 kilometres in total.\u000a\u000aStudies have suggested that intense rain cannot provide the lubrication needed for this to happen, so Tormey concludes that glacier melt must have been to blame.\u000a\u000aWith global temperatures on a steady rise, Tormey is concerned that history will repeat itself on volcanoes all over the world. He thinks that many volcanoes in temperate zones could be at risk.\u000a\u000a"There are far more human settlements and activities near the slopes of glaciated active volcanoes today than there were 10,000 years ago, so the effects could be catastrophic," New Scientist quoted him as saying.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Islamists rally in Egypt ahead of referendum vote, 3 killed\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VTill a few years ago, climate change was the elephant in the room at global development forums. Leaders were aware of it but either chose not to see it or denied it had consequences that could be even remotely catastrophic. Things have changed since, quite dramatically. Today, climate change is viewed as a problem of elephantine proportions.Things have moved up a notch from last year, which ended with the much publicized no-show at the Copenhagen summit . Not only has a global consensus emerged that climate change is for real, but there\u2019s increasing discussion about the tricky question of action required to contain it.While much scientific literature, as well as striking images, is available on the devastation that greenhouse gases have been wreaking on the globe \u2013 glacial and polar ice melts, rising global mean temperatures and sea levels \u2013 what is now needed is more country-specific research and discussion on the hazards ahead and ways to mitigate them."Climate Change, Society & Sustainable Development: Agenda for Action", makes a good beginning in this direction, for India. It\u2019s a collection of papers by experts \u2013 scientific researchers, agriculture agriculture and energy specialists, policy-planners, non-governmental voices and advocacy groups. It presents both the wide arc of the problem as well as a deeper look into the sectoral issues involved.The book aims to, according to the foreword by M S Swaminathan , father of the Green Revolution , provide information that would help "develop a strategy for sustainable human security in our country". That may sound ambitious but the book\u2019s multi-disciplinary approach is the right way to go about understanding these issues in India.However, it has some limitations. These are imposed by our current level of knowledge. For instance, veteran glaciologist Syed Iqbal Hasnain in his paper on the Hindu Kush and Himalayan glaciers points to the need for more on-site research to better understand the dynamics of melting and downwasting of glaciers. Climate scientist S K Dash, while touching on differential temperature increases in regions, prolonged fog in cities and changes in rainfall patterns, also calls for more data. That said, the book will serve both the serious reader who wants to look at the intertwined shoots and branches of the climate problem, and the policy planner for whom it would be a ready reckoner of sorts.

a((VBANGALORE: How do changes in climate affect species and biodiversity ? A study by scholars from Bangalore-based National Institute of Advanced Studies ( NIAS ) and National Centre for Biological Sciences ( NCBS ) has shown that climate change infact caused the emergence of two species from one in the case of some small birds in the mountains of western ghats A genetic study conducted by V V Robin, Anindya Sinha and Uma Ramakrishnan from NIAS and NCBS examined how a species of bird found only in the western ghats, the white-bellied shortwing, gave rise to two species of birds.According to an NCBS release, their genetic data found that the major geographical gaps in the western ghats, the Palghat gap and the Shencottah gap, both of which today provide major rail and road connectivity across the western ghats (between Kerala and Tamil Nadu), caused a break in the population of the species.Population across Palghat gap separated five million years ago, and the Nilgiris and Anamalai hills, to the north and south of this gap, harbour two different species of the white-bellied shortwing. Across the smaller Shencottah Gap, population separated about two million years ago. The study of these species by the three scholar shows that single species of thebird can now be split into two different species -- white-bellied shortwing and rufous-bellied shortwing -- on either side of the Palakkad Gap. These were names used by legendary Indian ornithologist, Salim Ali.Interestingly, glacial cycles, especially the ice ages, may also have played an important role in splitting these species, scientists say. During the ice ages, the tropical regions got drier, driving species adapted to wet-forest conditions higher up into the mountains where they became isolated.According to the study, the most recent ice age about 20,000 years ago also impacted these species. These isolated populations on mountaintops were severely affected, and as forests shrunk drastically, they went through a massive population decline. When the ice age ended and forests recovered, the survivors multiplied to give us the current population, the NCBS study says.It provides an example of how species respond to changes in climate based on their ecology. Such information will help predict how species may respond to future climate change allowing more targeted conservation.The Western Ghats is a biodiversity hotspot, and forests on hill tops here (called sky-islands) harbour highly specialised species not found in lowland forests. These specialised plants and animals are virtually trapped on these islands, and studying them gives clues to their origin.High elevation species are strongly affected by climatic change and as it gets warmer, species move higher up on mountains. These species therefore face greater threat of extinction due to global warming. So genetic tools can then be used to understand their response to past climate change.

a((VCompanies using Indias coasts to transport goods between domestic ports can soon start claiming carbon credit as shipping ministry, in collaboration with its environment and commerce counterparts, is framing a mechanism to enable firms know how much carbon emission they have prevented and receive the monetary benefits for that.\u000a\u000aThis is the first time that the government is linking shipping sector with carbon credits. It is one of the measures through which the shipping ministry wants to promote coastal shipping, which accounts for only 6% of the total domestic cargo movement even though the country has more than 7,500-km coastline and over 200 ports. In Europe, coastal shipping has a 40% share in total cargo moved.\u000a\u000aUse of waterways is cost effective and most environment-friendly mode of transport but it is difficult to attract customers. We are working on a policy to promote coastal shipping. One part of the policy is to make carbon credit feasible. The technicality of the situation is to whom the benefit should go Our thinking is that it should go to the users of the waterways, shipping secretary K Mohandas told FE. Waterways are considered cheaper mode of transport as it results in up to 40% saving when compared to roadways.\u000a\u000aThe ministry has given a time of two months to Directorate General of Shipping (DG Shipping) to form the policy. In turn, DG Shipping has involved Indian Coastal Conferencethe lobby of coastal ship operators, major and minor ports and coastal states.\u000a\u000aI think within this time we will be able to put the policy in public domain even as discussions continue at the departmental level, Director General of Shipping Satish B Agnihotri told FE from Mumbai over telephone. I am going to announce the preparation of the policy at a conference organised by Indian Coastal conference on November 16, Agnihotri said.

a((VAway from the limelight, and shorn of the hype that surrounds climate change negotiations, more than 190 countries are meeting in Japan from Monday to finalise a landmark environment agreement that will have far-reaching implications for biodiversity-rich nations like India.\u000a\u000aThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) \u2014 which emerged out of the same 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that gave rise to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \u2014 is meeting in Nagoya, Japan, for its tenth biennial conference from October 18 to 29. The most important agenda before the meeting is to decide how the benefits accruing out of commercial exploitation of bio-resources, like medicinal plants or herbs, can be shared with local communities which own these resources or whose traditional knowledge about these resources had made the benefits possible.\u000a\u000aThe 'Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) Protocol', that is under negotiation, is being designed to deal with situations like those that had emerged following attempts by large multinational corporations to patent the medicinal properties of neem or turmeric \u2014 properties that have been known to several communities in India for hundreds of years and actively used in a number of circumstances.\u000a\u000aThe Protocol-in-the-making is based on the principle that the benefits of genetic resources must not be monopolised by individuals, corporations or even governments and that these must be shared with the larger communities of people.\u000a\u000aAccording to Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, there were about 400 applications pending before the US patent office seeking to use genetic resources found in India. About 200 such applications are said to be pending before the European patent office and approximately 100 in Australia.\u000a\u000a"For India, the ABS Protocol is as important as the climate change agreement, if not more. There is so much traditional knowledge available in our country and we need to protect that. When foreign companies access our bio-resources they must be made to share the benefits with us," Ramesh said.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Narendra Modi a monster, Trinamool has pact with him: Buddha\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

But similar pledges to stem biodiversity loss, first made when the U.N. biodiversity convention was adopted in 1992, have not been fulfilled. At the start of the decade, U.N. members pledged under the Millennium Development Goals to achieve \u201ca significant reduction\u201d in the rate of wildlife loss by 2010, the International Year of Biodiversity. Instead, habitat destruction has continued unabated, and some experts now warn that the planet faces its sixth mass extinction phase \u2014 the latest since dinosaurs vanished 65 million years ago.\u000a\u000aNearly a quarter of mammals, one-third of amphibians, more than one in eight birds, and more than a fifth of plant species now face the threat of extinction, said the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\u000a\u000aIn May, a U.N. report warned of looming \u201ctipping points\u201d that could irreversibly damage ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest, through logging and land clearance, and coral reefs through global warming and overfishing. The Earth's 6.8 billion humans are effectively living 50 per cent beyond the planet's bio-capacity in 2007, according to a new assessment by WWF, adding that by 2030, humans will effectively need the capacity of two Earths.

a((VIndias ambitious solar power mission which envisages investments of about Rs 3 lakh crore by 2022 and is a key component of the national action plan on climate change, has been put in serious jeopardy by bankers loath to lend to solar projects. Public sector banks and financial institutions dedicated to the power sector told FE that they have no way to assess the commercial viability of these projects and would tread warily.\u000a\u000aConcerned that lack of funding might derail the programme, the government is meeting bankers and solar power developers on Tuesday to discuss ways to finance solar projects.\u000a\u000aThe cost of setting up solar power projects in India works out to Rs 17 crore per mw, four times that of conventional projects. Bankers are also unsure about the performance of these plants. They are also apprehensive about the way the model power purchase agreement (PPA) has been structured.\u000a\u000aBankers want to know who will compensate for the shortfall if these plants fail to achieve minimum load factor of 20% as mentioned in the PPA. They feel the payment security mechanism is far below expectations.\u000a\u000aOur technical people want assurance on plant load factor, either from equipment supplier or the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) said HD Khunteta, finance director, Rural Electrification Corporation.\u000a\u000aA Oriental Bank of Commerce official said: The cost of a solar project is almost four times that of a thermal power plant. Therefore, debt-servicing for solar projects is tough... If the government gives subsidy in the form of higher tariffs, then these projects could become a little easier to finance.\u000a\u000aA senior executive from another PSB said: There is no provision for assigning PPA in favour of lenders as is the normal practice for conventional power projects. Further, there is no recourse for lenders in case of termination of PPA by NVVN, These issues were raised by bankers in a recent meeting with NVVN. However, NVVN said it would not be possible to accommodate bankers concerns, the executive said.\u000a\u000aIndia Infrastructure Finance Company CMD SK Goel said: Generally, solar projects which have entered into a PPA are easier to finance. If there is no PPA, then there is a risk and financiers would usually not want to lend to such projects. He, however, added that IIFCL was positive on solar projects, even though price remains a concern.\u000a\u000aPower from solar projects would be bundled with cheaper power from NTPCs coal-fired power plants. The bundled power will be sold to distribution companies at tariffs determined by central electricity regulatory commission (CERC).\u000a\u000aThe government is now trying to persuade the reluctant banks. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is holding a get-together of leading bankers and developers on Tuesday to evolve a financing model for solar projects. Indian banks remain wary of financing solar projects as they do not know how to appraise commercial viability of these projects, said Deepak Gupta, secretary, MNRE.\u000a\u000aBankers do not know about solar power generation technologies, their performance and international experience. We urge bankers to visit solar power plants which are already in operation in states like Karnataka, Gupta told FE.\u000a\u000aWe had a conference of bankers and developers in Mumbai on September 25. Chairmen of banks like SBI and Central Bank participated in the meeting. We suggested that banks set up a small working group to outline a financing model for solar power projects. We have also sought Asian Development Banks help in this matter, Gupta said.

But critics have warned that the good intentions, as with many of the proposals that will arise at the U.N. meeting in Nagoya, Japan, are likely to be outweighed by economic interests.\u000a\u000aThey also allege the plans are so domestically focused they will do little to halt the over-consumption and illegal trade of scarce species.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s biodiversity action plan designates 52 priority conservation areas, covering 23% of the country; it promises state funds for protection; and sets a target of controlling biodiversity loss by 2020.\u000a\u000aSichuan has been the first province to put the plan into action. It has set aside about 930m yuan and identified five ecological protection areas: one links to existing giant panda reserves, another restores an area damaged by industry, two conserve semi-tropical flora and fauna, and another offsets the impact of dams. The national plan, which builds on China\u2019s existing 2,500 nature reserves, has been praised by foreign conservationists.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are solid commitments. If China can implement this plan systematically, then they will be managing better than any other country,\u201d said Matthew Durnin, lead scientist in north Asia for the U.S. group Nature Conservancy.\u000a\u000aOuyang Zhiyun, vice president of the Ecological Society of China, said moves were also afoot to revise wildlife protection laws and ramp up \u201cecological transfer funds\u201d that reward counties for safeguarding areas that sequester carbon, conserve soil and biodiversity. This year the government has budgeted 30bn yuan for such environmental service payments, up from 12bn yuan last year.\u000a\u000aBut some conservationists have warned that poor enforcement often undermines such initiatives. \u201cSometimes the laws are not well implemented so the destruction ... goes unpunished,\u201d said Yan Xie, of the Wildlife Conservation Society.\u000a\u000aThe 10th conference of the Convention on Biological Diversity, lasting two weeks, will try to set targets for biodiversity protection and establish rules on sustainable and fairly shared genetic resources. But, noting the failure to meet the goals it set 10 years ago, some critics doubt the effectiveness of its voluntary actions. \u2014\u000a\u000a© Guardian News & Media 2010

Recycling paper alone has mitigated 4,633 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission, equivalent to planting 18,532 trees, and neutralized the negative impact of climate change on 2,895 average Indians.This was some good news from the year-long Solid Waste Management Round Table (SWMRT) shared here on Tuesday. SWMRT had also commissioned climate change experts no2co2.in to calculate the annual amount of carbon dioxide emission prevented by recycling domestic waste.Leading the success stories is Diamond District which now earns Rs 15,000 as average monthly income from recycling waste. About 900 households here regularly segregate wet and dry waste. Over 3.8 tonnes of dry waste is recycled here monthly.Same with Platinum City where 700 apartment units now segregate waste and 20 of its residents spread awareness to all. The complex has been earning between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 from dry waste over the past two months. Two streets in Sadashivanagar are also involved in dry waste collection."BBMP has allotted us four spaces where we collect dry waste. Over the past year, on an average, 320 tonnes of dry waste has been collected per month and recycled. This is just 10% of the city's garbage. We need to spread awareness," Dr Meenakshi Bharath told TOI.These statistics will also be shared with BBMP at SWMRT's second presentation at the Lok Adalat on October 23.

Technology and finance are central to the interventions, which are needed to propel a low-carbon growth.\u000a\u000aWhile acknowledging the challenges, the India Report 2010, released today, pointed out that moving away from a high-carbon infrastructure to clean technologies had the co-benefits of improvement in cost competitiveness and productivity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith 85 per cent of the country\u2019s infrastructure yet to be built, there is an opportunity to build and not commit the mistakes (of high emissions) made by the developed country,\u201d said former power minister and member of Parliament Suresh P Prabhu, while unveiling the report prepared under the aegis of 3-i Network, a collaborative effort of IDFC, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.\u000a\u000aPrabhu said it was the state\u2019s responsibility to build infrastructure and the government needed to create conducive atmosphere to enable increased private investment in infrastructure building. He stressed on creating a global regime, supported by the developed world, for technologies which could be used in reducing emissions in any part of the world.\u000a\u000aA large part of the government\u2019s effort towards low-carbon growth is directed in the power sector, since electricity contributes 38 per cent to the gross emissions of 1.9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

a((VLONDON: Beleaguered Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chairman and noted Indian economist Dr. Rajendra Pachauri has reportedly been put on notice to carry out new guidelines and ensure a management restructure after weathering a storm of criticism about mistakes in the IPCC 's most recent climate assessment report.Pachauri's handling of the affair was compounded by allegations of conflicts of interest and he was under intense pressure to quit.However, at the end of the IPCC's plenary meeting last week in Busan, South Korea, Pachauri remains firmly in charge.The Nature magazine quoted Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and co-chair of the IPCC's working group on climate-change mitigation, as saying that Pachauri has been put on notice.Edenhofer said: "Governments made it very clear that they expect him to make changes -- both to improve the IPCC's climate assessments and to foster greater public and political confidence in its work.""Delegates avoided talking about Pachauri's role," added Edenhofer.Insiders said there was a fear that targeting Pachauri could provoke a confrontation between the IPCC's rich and poor member countries.Instead, delegates in Busan focused in part on how to implement recommendations for reform from the Amsterdam-based InterAcademy Council ( IAC ), a consortium of national science academies.In March, the United Nations -- the IPCC's parent body -- asked the IAC to carry out a review of the IPCC and propose organizational and procedural changes.To restore some of the IPCC's lost credibility, and to make sure that its future assessments are more robust, the meeting eventually agreed on new guidelines, recommended by the IAC, on the use of non-peer-reviewed literature; on the characterization of scientific uncertainty; and on how to handle and correct errors.In future, IPCC authors will use consistent terminology to qualitatively describe uncertainties, and will cross check more thoroughly the authenticity and robustness of data and information taken from 'grey literature' that has not been peer reviewed.Most climate scientists say that errors in the assessment report -- such as the notorious statement that all Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 -- do not undermine the scientific case that human activity is dangerously warming the planet. But such errors must be corrected quickly and transparently to preserve the IPCC's credibility, the IAC said, and climate scientists agree.The IAC also proposed more far-reaching changes to the IPCC's management structure to streamline its decision-making. But delegates postponed any action pending the outcome of further investigation by several newly established task groups.By January 2011, these groups will propose options for improving the IPCC's management structures, review procedures, communication strategies and conflict-of-interest policies.The IPCC will decide how to implement these at its next plenary session, to be held in May 2011 in Abu Dhabi.Pachauri is optimistic about the future. The IPCC, he says, is well prepared to march ahead towards producing a fifth assessment report by the end of 2014."Despite all the noise we have not wasted a single minute to do what the world expects us to do. I, for one, never lack the physical and mental energy that is required for the job," he said.

The projects will be implemented under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission.\u000a\u000aHPGCL managing director Sanjeev Kaushal told FE that the solar power plants will be grid interactive and the process to finalise the consultants is on. So far we have been producing power through coal and hydel sources but now that the clean processes are available and the regulator is allowing its use for generation so we plan to foray into solar power generation. Moreover there can be improvement on technology front in this segment and we can make use of it, Kaushal said.\u000a\u000aFollowing a new model, the solar power plants will be set up at the existing land of thermal power plants at Panipat, Yamunanagar, Hisar and hydel power plant in Yamunanagar.\u000a\u000aHPGCL had floated tenders for engaging services of a consultant on June 28 this year. But after relaxing some stringent qualifying requirements, the tenders were reissued on July 14 and opened on July 28. Another senior official of HPGCL said seven firms had evinced interest to offer their consultancy services and three were shortlisted. HPGCL plans to establish the solar power plants within six to eight months and to take the process on a fasttrack. A solar and renewable energy cell has already been created.\u000a\u000aAs per the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) guidelines, a cost of Rs 16.90 crore per mw is involved in setting up solar photovoltaic power plant and Rs 15.30 crore per mw is involved for solar thermal plant.\u000a\u000aThe tariff fixed by CERC is Rs 17.91 per unit for solar photovoltaic and Rs 15.29 per unit for solar thermal.

a((VHUBLI: The South Western Railway chief electrical engineer V K Tempe has said the railways has taken several initiatives for maintaining energy conservation.Speaking at a seminar on carbon credit in the city recently, he said, "SWR has so far provided 28,720 CFL lamps at various places and 8,400 more such lamps will be provided by the end of March. A total of 14,126 T-5 (slim tube lights) fittings have been provided at various stations and other work spots and provision of such T-5 fittings numbering 32,000 during 2010-11 is under progress."He said three re-generative battery chargers have been provided at Hubli and Mysore workshops. At least 252 stations have been provided with light Circuits on railway platforms. Plans are on to provide 208 solar lights at level crossing gates during 2010-11. Eighteen solar street lights and 103 solar emergency lights have been provided at various stations. In addition to that, 52 (17,400 litres capacity/day) and 25 (12,500 litres/day) of the solar water heaters have been provided for different areas, he said, hoping that these measures would definitely save lot of power consumption.He further said that a windmill to generate 10.5 megawatt of power has been proposed at an estimated cost of Rs 65 crores, which would definitely give positive results in saving power.Kuldeep Chaturvedi, general manager, SWR, said, "Though railways have done a lot for saving energy, still a lot of commitments needs to be done with regard to utilizing innovative devices."

a((VAHMEDABAD: The 11-day Common Wealth Games (CWG) 2010, which concluded recently in New Delhi, produced 1.28 lakh tonnes of carbon emissions.The estimate was done by a team of students of the post graduate programme in management (PGP) at the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad ( IIM-A ) as part of its academic project.The second-year students - -Bhanu Prabha, A Pratheeba and Tabassum Perween - had used secondary data from various sources to separately calculate the carbon footprints of the event, including transportation, construction, electricity, food and beverages, the opening and closing ceremonies and even the CWG Queens Baton.The project, under the guidance of professor at IIM-A Amit Garg, revealed that out of nine major stadiums whose carbon footprints were analysed, SP Mukherjee stadium released 1,100 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the largest.Tabassum said, \u201cA technology called \u2018screw chiller\u2019 used to maintain the water temperature of swimming pools has contributed to the stadium\u2019s high carbon emissions. With an emission of 14 tonnes of CO2, the least polluting stadium turned out to be Dr Karni Singh stadium, where shooting competitions were held.The students said that the proper arrangement of seating to accommodate the maximum number of audience, the process of conducting the events, and its design, apart from its size, play a significant role in deciding the carbon emission of a stadium.The students said that the actual carbon footprint of CWG, if different from their estimation, can only be higher than the figures they have arrived at. Prabha said, \u201cSince we were not present at the event and had no access to precise data, we have adopted a very conservative estimation. So, in a way, the figure we have projected is the minimum if not the exact.\u201d According to the students\u2019 report, out of the 1.28 lakh tonnes of C02 emitted at various CWG venues, 70 per cent comes from the use of electricity during different phases of the event, including the construction of infrastructure, lighting of the stadiums, power consumption at the Games Village and so on.The second major cause of pollution was transportation, which accounted for 21 per cent of the total figure. The maximum carbon footprint came from organizers and players who flew down to Delhi.The students suggested that pollution from transportation could be cut down by optimizing air transportation of the payers through prior planning and co-ordination to avoid vacant seats on flights.The students also suggested that the carbon footprint of each player be calculated and companies should be asked to sponsor it. The organizers, players and the audience must reduce their own carbon footprints, they suggested. An attempt to offset the carbon footprint is the next step, said Garg.

a((VHOUSTON: In a commercial scheme that attempts to rectify some of the inequalities inflicted by the beginnings of climate change, water from a lake in Alaska will be sent to a new, yet-to-be-built water hub in Mumbai and then exported to arid cities in the Middle East.A San Antonio, Texas, based company has announced plans to export 12 billion gallons of water per year from the Blue Lake Reservoir in Sitka, Alaska, to a new, yet-to-be-built water hub on the west coast of India.There's trillions of litres of water in a three mile-long reservoir near a town called Sitka in the archipelago off the western coast of Canada.It's named Blue Lake, and fewer than 9,000 people live nearby, meaning that there's very little local pressure on the water supply.The water in the lake is pure enough to drink without any treatment, and a local bottling business has for some time siphoned small quantities out for thirsty people around North America.But a new deal with Texas company S2C Global Systems could see far greater amounts extracted for a much larger-scale operation.S2C's plan is to siphon off 10.9 billion litres of water -- enough to meet the needs of a city of 500,000 -- each year from the reservoir, which then be pumped into a tanker and sent to a port south of Mumbai on the west coast of India.There, it'll be bottled and distributed around the region for profit, including to a port in Iraq.For security reasons, the company did not disclose the port, however this first hub will include a berth for a Suezmax vessel, an offloading system to a dedicated tank farm and a distribution complex for packaged water.Within 18 months after that we will be able to switch to a very large class vessel (302,833 cubic meters/80 Million USG), as both the ship and the berth for her will be completed within this time frame.The company will be able to sell from its hub bulk fresh water by way of smaller ships that can deliver to shallower ports, like Umm Qasr in Iraq (located within 4 days of India's west coast).S2C will also sell fresh water in 20-foot containers with flexi-tanks (4623 USG) suitable for pharmaceutical/high tech manufacturing and packaged water (18.9 and 10L) for the consumer markets anywhere containers are delivered in south and west Asia from India.Alaskan mountain water is so pure it requires no treatment except to remove organics that might be present through the natural cycle.During its 30 day voyage from Alaska to the Arabian Sea we will protect the water using an "Ozonating" system in the ships holds."S2C Global has an exciting future in India and the region", Rod Bartlett, managing partner of Alaska Resource Management and president of S2C Global Systems, USA said.

a((VThe author is professor of policy studies at IIT-Delhi\u000a\u000aThe climate constraint will become increasingly problematic for developing countries as they try to meet their development needs. For example, it is estimated that more than 2.7 billion people worldwide still rely on biomass, burnt in open fires or traditional three-stone \u2018cookstoves\u2019 and that almost 1.4 billion people do not have access to electricity. On a per capita basis, developing countries use one-fifth of the energy of industrialized countries, and least-developed countries , only one-sixteenth . Thus developing countries will need to significantly enhance their energy infrastructure in the coming decades to meet development needs even as the atmosphere is increasingly overloaded with the accumulated greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from industrialized countries.The reference scenario in the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook 2009 suggests that as much as 90% of the growth in energy demand worldwide between 2008 and 2030 will come from non-OECD countries (mainly in Asia) and that these countries will account for almost two-thirds of the power generation capacity addition worldwide during this period. This scenario has also estimated that global power-generation investments during this period will be about $7.2 trillion and that more than half of these investments will be needed in developing countries. Under a scenario to maintain GHG concentrations below 450 parts-per million (a commonly-talked about target), the required investment would increase by almost 30%.So these countries are faced with daunting energy needs, ever-harder climate constraints and potentially enormous incremental investment needs. Technology could, in principle, play a crucial role by allowing for a low-GHG growth and some level of adaptation against climate impacts . But realizing the potential of technology to help meet this challenge is not always a straightforward task.In fact, successful innovation \u2013 translation of knowledge or technology into commercial application \u2013 requires paying attention to a range of activities underpinning the development and deployment of technologies and often involves a variety of actors. But developing countries often have weak innovation capabilities. Thus a targeted mechanism to supplement and strengthen these capabilities to advance innovation on climate technologies could make an enormous impact.With precisely this in mind, the government has proposed Climate Innovation Centres (CICs) \u2013 these would be institutions in developing countries aimed at enhancing their climate innovation processes through a systematic analysis of the gaps across various parts of the innovation chain for particular technologies within that country\u2019s context and then working with existing actors to address these gaps.The CICs would advance a range of innovation-relevant activities, such as helping refine and adapt technologies and products to local conditions, product demonstration projects, market-creation activities, design of delivery models, incubation of enterprises and development of policy regimes \u2013 while ultimately building indigenous capacity on climate innovation.This concept has received support from many quarters and hopefully will find acceptance as part of the Technology Mechanism under the Climate Convention. Of course, climate negotiations follow their own logic and there are other perspectives on the technology issue. But as President Obama rightly said during his recent announcement of the firstever US Development Policy that \u201cthe purpose of development...is creating the conditions where assistance is no longer needed.\u201d Climate Innovation Centers are intended to do precisely that \u2013 move away from a world of dependency on \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d and help developing countries build capacity to meet their climate challenges. Hopefully the climate negotiators in the upcoming climate meeting in Cancun will see it the same way.

If governments continue negotiating at this pace, there may be nothing on the plate by the end of the conference."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNevertheless, there are still hopes the talks will pick up steam when environment ministers turn up in Nagoya this week and take over from their advisers for the final three days of the summit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the opening day of the talks last Monday, delegates from the 193 members of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) were told that a meaningful deal in Nagoya was crucial to save the world's biodiversity.

a((VMUMBAI: Green buildings or environment-friendly buildings do not find a mention in BMC\u2019s draft property tax rules.In 2007, the BMC had appointed the United States Agency for International Aid USAID ), the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC) and the Science and Technology Park, Pune, to formulate the technical criteria and a plan for implementing the eco-housing programme. BMC had even announced its intention to give a 50% rebate on property tax for buildings and individual houses that were environment-friendly.Increasingly, builders in the city are offering constructions that are termed Green Buildings and even certified as such by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) a globally recognized green building certification system. Green buildings are structures that minimize the damage to the environment through the use of solar energy, natural lighting, water recycling, rain-water harvesting, local and natural construction materials and generating minimum garbage etc.However, the draft property rules go so far as to even include the area of the structure for an effluent treatment plant while arriving at the capital value of a building.It is now mandatory for all new constructions with a plot size of more than 2,000 sq m to have a rainwater harvesting system and for over 20,000 sq m it is mandatory to install an effluent treatment plant for treating 20% of the sewage generated by the residents."The BMC has the opportunity to promote eco-housing by providing weightage to such buildings in its property tax rules. At least it will incentivize citizens to implement some environment-friendly," said sources.S S Shinde, joint municipal commissioner, in charge of assessment and collection, however, said the property tax rules were business rules. "Eco-housing programme is a policy. We can subsequently issue circulars announcing property tax rebates for such buildings. But it is not possible to include it in the property tax rules since it is all about computing capital value," he said.Citizens can send in their objections and suggestions on the draft property tax rules before November 16.

From holding up the Navi Mumbai airport project to thumbing down hydel projects in the north-east, Ramesh's ministry has been in the thick of the action. Dilli is impressed at the sudden emergence of this new nerve centre of UPA's policy making.It is also buzzing with questions on Ramesh's remarkable survival instinct. Is it the Prime Minister who opposed him on Vedanta? Who is backing Ramesh in his environmental adventurism? Is it 10 Janpath? Or is it Rahul Gandhi?Now it is beginning to look more likely that Ramesh indeed has the backing of the party President. And with the Maharashtra government now throwing the gauntlet at him again by controversially approving mining in the Western Ghats, apparently a state subject, Dilli awaits Ramesh's response to this new challenge.Few tears would have been shed in Dilli if the authorities had driven the dreaded Blueline buses off the roads (an unsuccessful aspiration, cut short already). But in Mumbai, the concern is over the state government's decision to change the colour of the city's cabs from the familiar black-and-yellow to listless beige.Naturally, the first to protest this seemingly whimsical directive are the city's taxi unions, who fear it is another step towards depriving them of their livelihood.But the fact is that the black-and-yellow cabs are fighting a losing battle, especially since 2008 when a city court had ordered these taxis to be phased out.While Mumbaikars may or may not miss the old decrepit Fiats, the Mumbai authorities are now keen to brand the city and bring it up to global standards.This, then, could be just a step towards that shiny, happy future and hopefully even more new-age taxi variants.

"Farmers have bred seeds for drought, flood and salt tolerance over millennia. Climate resilience ultimately depends on farmers' innovation, biodiversity and agro-ecological processes staying in the hands of farming communities."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSilvia Ribeiro of ETC Group warned: "The gene giants are stockpiling patents that threaten to put a choke-hold on the world's biomass and our future food supply. The breadth of many patent claims on climate ready crop genes is staggering. In many cases, a single patent or patent application claims ownership of engineered gene sequences that could be deployed in virtually all major crops - as well as the processed food and feed products derived from them."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aETC Group has identified over 262 patent families, adding up to 1,663 patent documents published worldwide (both applications and issued patents) that make specific claims on environmental stress tolerance in plants (such as drought, heat, flood, cold, salt tolerance).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDuPont, Monsanto, BASF, Bayer, Syngenta and their biotech partners account for 77 percent of the patent families identified. Just three companies - DuPont, BASF, Monsanto - account for over two-thirds of the total. Public sector researchers hold only 10 percent.\u000a\u000a"In a desperate bid for moral legitimacy and to try to ease public acceptance of genetically modified crops, the gene giants have donated a few proprietary crop genes to poor farmers in Africa," said Ribeiro.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"The quid pro quo is that developing country governments must facilitate market access for genetically modified crops and embrace biotech-friendly patent laws. It's an unacceptable trade-off. In exchange for untested technologies, these governments are being pressured to surrender national sovereignty over intellectual property, biomass, and food."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Governments meeting at the UN biodiversity summit must put a stop to the patent grab, yet another false solution to climate change. They should instruct their patent offices to reject or rescind all of these patents," said ETC Group's Neth Daño. "A fundamental review of all intellectual property claims in agriculture should be jointly undertaken by the CBD and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). These patents also clearly violate the FAO Seed Treaty and its governing body must investigate and take action."

They can make a difference in rural areas that suffer from power shortage or those which have not been electrified.The company has drawn up a rate contract with the Maharashtra Energy Development Authority (MEDA), the nodal agency of the state government for renewable energy initiatives. The system will be subsidised by the Union government.The first such solar water pump was installed by the gram panchayat of Talegaon Dhamdhere in Pune district earlier this week. Zilla Parishad president Savita Dagde was present.Nitiyan Mutiyan, director of Span Pumps, said, "A large percentage of India's rural communities depend on borewells for drinking water. These borewells are fit with hand pumps. It takes about 40 strokes to fill a bucket of water. The solar-operated submersible pumps will help draw between 5,000 to 20,000 litres every day. It will operate automatically on solar power and store water in an overhead tank."The pumping system consists of the pump and solar array. It has been specially developed for borewells, said development consultant Narendra Purankar. "A solar array (300-800 W) is installed near the borewell. A pump is installed below the hand pump cylinder, and works on power generated from photovoltaic solar cells. Both the submersible and hand pumps share the same pipes. Unlike other solar systems, the new system operates without battery or an inverter. The pump draws power from the solar array directly. The pump is connected to a storage tank and water is dispensed through a stand post," he said.On a regular day, the pump operates for about 7-8 hours between sunrise and sunset. After sunset or when solar power is not available the users can pump to draw water. The system has a back-up and ensures uninterrupted water supply."The initial installation cost is between Rs 2.5 and Rs 4.5 lakh depending on the capacity of the solar array and the pump. "Solar power is free and there is no loss or wastage of power. Besides, the solar panel will last for 15-20 years, and both operations and maintenance costs are low," Purankar said.So far, 50 such pumps have been installed in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and 15 pumps have been exported to African countries, Mutiyan said.Eom//kscleared/mdStory-Istory: Solar powered hand pumps for rural areasTimes News NetworkPune: Solar energy powered hand pumps have been launched by a city based company to help villagers draw water from wells without the laborious manual pumping process.The pumps developed by Span Pumps Private Limited help save time and energy in pumping ground water, mainly in rural areas which are not reached by electricity.

Do you see danger with the Copenhagen Accord (CA), reaching the same stalemate as the Kyoto Protocol (KP) when it comes to burden sharing of emission cuts?\u000a\u000aIn terms of the 29 countries (who negotiated the accord), those were the ones in the small room negotiating and now when it comes to association with the CA, it\u2019s almost 140 countries and I think that\u2019s remarkable. Whether it will lead to a dead end...I hope not, because it is a commitment taken at the level of the heads of state. It is in the end a political agreement but also it is a political commitment at the highest level. And I would find it very hard for individual countries to run away from the CA. You can, on one hand, say look under KP we have much more detailed provisions on implementation. The CA is just a two-and-a-half pages, so it is a skeleton but there are a lot of important decisions in there. And those commitments we would like to see put into practice. As other countries expect us to deliver on fast-track finance, we would expect the countries who made some pledges to really implement them right now.\u000a\u000aThe CA shifts the argument towards a pledge-and-review system, which the US is pushing. Does that derail talks on the KP?\u000a\u000aFor us, definitely. We would not like to see it as a pledge-and-review process. We still hope that there will be a point in time when we would discuss those pledges one by one. The way it is done, the matrix of those commitments is very different in one country from the other. That\u2019s the beauty of the KP. You talk of one base year, 1990, reduction in emissions in terms of percentages etc. It is much clearer in KP. Still we would hope that on the CA, it is not the last word.\u000a\u000aIt is the start for a discussion and debate but it was very difficult in the last months to really put it on the agenda. A lot of hesitation to come back to those pledges and discuss them. And a particular number of developing countries who seemingly have difficulties explaining that in the official setting of the UN.\u000a\u000aDoes the EU leadership feel slighted about the climate agenda being turned towards what the US wants?\u000a\u000aMaybe we are a bit sad. At least when we came out of Copenhagen. We were sad that okay, it is not going in the very structured way of the KP. On the other hand we also know that maybe in the present point in time, in terms of what is possible in terms of a political compromise is not more than what we have in the CA. Even the Accord is something that is not agreed to by everybody. If you seek consensus with all parties, it might be watered down further. So there is a trade-off.\u000a\u000aFor us, what is important is that it takes the fight against climate change further. There is recognition of actions by developing countries. We believe that is important. In the current system, you do it in an irregular manner in the form of national communications, which come too late. With the CA, we can have that on a more regular basis. So hopefully this is a start for gaining further momentum. Not to be seen as an end point at the very rock bottom. The good thing is that the CA sets an aspiration, a target of 2 degrees (Celsius). It also sets out the process.\u000a\u000aHow optimistic are you about Cancun?\u000a\u000aI am still optimistic. I hope there is a realization that this process needs to show the rest of the world that this can deliver. If not, then I think we have seen the public reactions after Copenhagen and what was in the media. To have a similar reaction again is going to undermine public confidence in the UN process. It\u2019s not about just confidence and trust between parties. It\u2019s really the men and the women in the street who want to know if this will get us anywhere. They are the ones who pay for the process. And they want to know what\u2019s the value for money. If there is no progress, then they will say it is just useless guys, sitting there, talking to each other.\u000a\u000aHas the UN outlived its purpose in climate negotiations?\u000a\u000aI think it can deliver and there is a way forward. Maybe we have to look at a kind of a flexible approach. Of course, the UN system is such that everyone has to be on board. But maybe this is something we need to reflect on. And I think we see some international initiatives such as on REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) and the partnership. Not everyone is involved because not everyone is a stakeholder.\u000a\u000aAnd also if you look into the convention, there is a particular paragraph dealing with saying the UN should encourage regional action. It should encourage limited groups to take the agenda forward.\u000a\u000aIsn\u2019t a smaller group taking decisions for everyone unfair to the rest of the countries?\u000a\u000aAs long as you keep an open structure, if you want to contribute to the same objectives, then please come on board. That is where we have seen the 29 countries in the small room agreeing but then afterwards other countries saying that we also want to associate with the CA. As long as you keep an open structure, I don\u2019t think one could say it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not about an exclusive club. It will be more difficult if some countries want to do the opposite. Because then you would have the same stand as in the UN system.\u000a\u000aWhat is the balance between the amorphous nature of the CA and the structure of the UN?\u000a\u000aYou see, at the end, what counts is as they say, \u201cproof of the pudding is in the eating\u201d. So what is going to happen after you commit, whether in the UN or in the context of the CA. Let\u2019s be frank. If you look at KP, in terms of what it has delivered, we cannot say everyone is on track to meet commitments under Kyoto. So, despite the fact that you have a compliance system in place and enforcement provisions, there is no 100% guarantee that people will comply. So, when we say one is wishy washy, I think one has to look at the end result. After the end of the commitment period, you have to ask where we stand.\u000a\u000aWill the world be able to avoid a 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature?\u000a\u000aThere will be effects of climate change. That is inevitable. Even if we talk about managing to reach the 2-degree objective, there is still something that will happen within the 2- degree framework. Future generations will have to cope with that.\u000a\u000aThat is the legacy we will give them. The question is, will it be 2 or 4 or 6? I am still confident that we can make it. Because the voices of the younger generation will be more numerous. And they will put more weight in the political process.\u000a\u000apadmaparna.g@livemint.com

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aSouth Africa is to unveil plans this week for what it claims will be the world\u2019s biggest solar power plant \u2014 a radical step in a coal\u2014dependent country where one in six people still lacks electricity.\u000a\u000aThe project, expected to cost up to 200bn rand (GBP18.42bn), would aim by the end of its first decade to achieve an annual output of five gigawatts (GW) of electricity \u2014 currently one\u2014tenth of South Africa\u2019s energy needs.\u000a\u000aGiant mirrors and solar panels would be spread across the Northern Cape province, which the government says is among the sunniest 3% of regions in the world with minimal cloud or rain.\u000a\u000aThe government hopes the solar park will help reduce carbon emissions from Africa\u2019s biggest economy, which is still more than 90% dependent on coal\u2014fired power stations. In April, the World Bank came in for sharp criticism from environmentalists for approving a $3.75bn (GBP2.37bn) loan to build one of the world\u2019s largest coal\u2014fired power plants in the country.\u000a\u000aEnergy is already a high priority in South Africa where, at the end of racial apartheid, less than 40% of households had electricity. Over 16 years the governing African National Congress has undertaken a huge national expansion, with a recent survey showing that 83% are now connected, but power outages are still not uncommon in both townships and middle\u2014class suburbs.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 200 foreign and domestic investors will meet this week in Upington, Northern Cape, with a view to funding the hugely ambitious solar project. A master plan will be set out by the US engineering and construction group Fluor. This follows a viability study by the Clinton Climate Initiative, which described South Africa\u2019s \u201csolar resource\u201d as among the best in the world.\u000a\u000aJonathan de Vries, the project manager, said today: \u201cI\u2019d hate to make a large claim but yes, this would be the biggest solar park in the world.\u201d De Vries said the park, costing 150\u2014200bn rand, would aim to be contributing to the national grid by the end of 2012. In the initial phase it would produce 1,000 megawatts, or 1GW, using a mix of the latest solar technologies.\u000a\u000aAn initial 9,000 hectares of state\u2014owned land have been earmarked for the park, with further sites in the \u201csolar corridor\u201d being explored.\u000a\u000aDe Vries, a special adviser to the energy minister, said the Northern Cape had been chosen for insolation readings (a measure of solar energy) that rank among the highest in the world. \u201cIt hardly ever rains, it hardly has clouds. It\u2019s even better than the Sahara desert because it doesn\u2019t have sandstorms.\u201d The Orange River would provide water for the facilities, he added, while existing power transmission lines would be closer than for similar projects such as in Australia.\u000a\u000aNorthern Cape, which contains the historic diamond\u2014rush town, Kimberley, is South Africa\u2019s biggest province and one of its poorest. But it is hoped that the park would create a \u201csolar hub\u201d and regenerate the local economy with fresh opportunities in manufacturing.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa currently consumes 45\u201448GW of power per year. It is estimated this will double over the next 25 years. \u201cIn South Africa over 90% of our power comes from the burning of coal and we need to reduce this because of our international obligations on climate change,\u201d de Vries said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this proves to be cost competitive with coal and nuclear, the government will roll out more solar parks. This is a very bold attempt.\u201d He added: \u201cSolar power isn\u2019t a panacea that will cure all but it\u2019s a part of the solution, and a very important part. There are zones in the world that are ideally suited to it, often those with low population density.\u201d\u000a\u000aCopyright: Guardian News & Media 2010

a((VBetter to focus on bilateral deals rather than waste resources on multinational talk fests.\u000a\u000aThere was one prominent absentee at the of the last week. Even more significantly, he was the one who had coined the phrase \u201ccurrency wars\u201d, a topic that was central to this So, why did the finance minister of Brazil choose to stay away? Perhaps it was due to the pressure of national elections, says of the Financial Times charitably. But is there a bigger message? Is G20 already sputtering? It was born 11 years ago as a discussion forum. It wasn\u2019t supposed to take binding decisions, and certainly did not have the authority to impose its decisions on members outside the club. The emergency meeting of November 2008, convened by the outgoing US president, changed that perception. Subsequent success in global coordination of fiscal stimuli seemed to increase its credibility and clout. But questions about G20\u2019s legitimacy and representativeness remained. It may not be merely an enlargement of the erstwhile G7, but it cannot speak for everybody. It seems to be a self-appointed body that will set universal rules. But will others listen? It prides itself on not having any permanent secretariat but it still needs a much stronger and well-defined constitution, and transparent rules of engagement. Else its image as a just series of talk fests without consequences is likely to get entrenched. Already there are cracks within, and Brazil\u2019s no-show at Seoul is not helping.\u000a\u000aGranted, that the issues being discussed at G20 are inherently intractable and require multinational coordination. So, failure of G20 may be less institutional, and more to do with the issues themselves. Even then, G20 appears increasingly ineffective in tackling the challenge of preventing mindless currency devaluations, or correcting trade imbalances. The former requires that everyone gang up on China, from which even US allies shy away. The latter requires that Germany, Japan and China cut back on exports, which they won\u2019t. Even the IMF quota reform announced in Seoul is also not really a G20 achievement. India has been campaigning for quota reform for 15 years in the IMF. It has been a net lender to the IMF for most of that time. So, if IMF realignment is happening now, it is a belated victory of a long-running campaign, and not just due to hard-bargaining within G20.\u000a\u000aIt is not just G20, but even the other well-founded organisations of global governance are facing similar challenge of looming irrelevance. IMF quota reform has come now, but just two years ago, the IMF was searching for a new mandate for itself. Since the East Asian crisis, have been stocking up on foreign exchange as self-insurance, declaring independence from contingent IMF rescue. Back in 1997, Malaysia showed that capital controls work against IMF advice, and eventually in 2010 the IMF agreed. The IMF advocates risk diversification, but its own funds are concentrated in just four risky countries. As for the World Bank, it has acknowledged that private investment and aid flows completely dwarf its development funding. The ability of sub-national entities to directly tap into capital markets and global investors has made the Bank less relevant. Besides, who wants Bank/Fund conditionalities? Ever since one of their own insiders (now ostracised) wrote scathingly of the Bank\u2019s record, especially in Africa, there has been recurrent talk of reforming the Bretton Woods organisations.\u000a\u000aThe (WTO) isn\u2019t faring much better. The round of talks launched in Doha in 2001 is now in its 10th year, with no end in sight. The western economies will not reduce their agricultural subsidies, and the developing countries will not ease industrial trade barriers in return. There seems to be no way out of this multilateral deadlock. To make matters worse, the financial and job crises seem to be making western economies more protectionist. Non-tariff barriers may be going up. The WTO also seems to be unfairly loading the trade agenda with unrelated issues like environment impact, labour rights, intellectual property rights and newfangled ideas like food miles.\u000a\u000aMore than free trade, or global financial architecture, the issue of global warming is a genuine global commons concern, requiring multilateral coordination. Here too there is currently a distinct lack of enthusiasm. In December 2009, Copenhagen was the venue for a historic 15th meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It was also an occasion for a meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol. That protocol will expire in 2012, and Copenhagen was to have resulted in a clear road map beyond 2012. The most important non-signatory to Kyoto was expected to lead the charge. But Copenhagen was a failure. There were no binding agreements, no firm commitments, no adoption of numerical targets, only vague statements of intention. There was just an insipid accord signed by six big countries, including India. It was indeed an anticlimax to a frenzied build-up to what was promised to be a defining milestone in global cooperation.\u000a\u000aIndia has thus far invested heavily in conforming to and strengthening multilateral fora. It prides itself on being a founder member of Bretton Woods and GATT. Its negotiating teams whether to G20, or WTO, or UNFCCC are ever larger and include non-government delegates as well. There are hectic pre-conference parleys to ensure predictability, or softening of opposing stands. There are world trips by various government officials to project soft power and evidence of good faith. But what is India getting in return? It can be argued that even the end of nuclear apartheid that India was subjected to for three decades came not by multilateral negotiations, but by single-focused deal-making with one country. So also in trade. India\u2019s largest trade partner is now China, a country hardly known for its passion for multilateralism. It understands quid pro quo, and this is best achieved in bilateral talks, not multilateral ones. India belatedly woke up to the futility of multilateralism in trade, and furiously worked to make up for lost time, with signing up of several free trade agreements (FTAs). Those FTAs are reaping richer dividends for India than what the WTO has done so far. In nuclear diplomacy too, the bilateral deals with France, Russia or Japan will go a long way than any multilateral engagement with the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\u000a\u000aSeoul, Copenhagen, Doha (or Cancun, or Geneva, or whatever is the latest venue) are all pointing to a fatigue of multilateralism. India needs to play this down cycle of globalisation with realigned priorities and reallocated resources.\u000a\u000aThe author is chief economist, Aditya Birla Group.

Shell and South African state-owned company Sasol own 2.44 per cent each.\u000a\u000aLocated at the Statoil Mongstad oil refinery, northwest of Bergen, the CO2 Technology Centre would have access to flue gas from the gas-fired combined heat and power plant and the refinery catalytic cracker. CO2 stands for carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aAfter the development of a viable technology, the process could be commercially used in countries like India and China, which have a growing demand for carbon-emitting energy. The partners have already invested about $450 million in the project. Carbon capture and storage technology involves capturing CO2 emissions from industrial sources and transporting them by pipeline to sites, where they are injected into deep rock formations for permanent storage. The centre will test two types of capture technology on flue gas, both from the Mongstad refinery cracker and a gas-fired combined heat power plant on the site. While the gas-based power plant yields CO2 contents of about 3.5 per cent, the refinery cracker gives 13 per cent of flue gas, equivalent to a coal-based power plant.\u000a\u000aDesigned to capture about 100,000 tonnes CO2 annually, the project was earlier expected to be completed in 2011, but funding issues have delayed its full commissioning to 2012. In May 2010, Sasol joined the project. \u201cThe partnerships are important for us since we want to get the point of views of other into the project,\u201d said Henriksen.

a((VA Chinese boy cycles past a cooling towers in Dadong. Researchers at Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen said that climate change probably occurs as a result of different chaotic influences and as a result would be difficult to predict. File Photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aClimate change is a topic for hot debate across countries right now, but is it possible to predict future climate change?\u000a\u000aResearchers at Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen said that climate change probably occurs as a result of different chaotic influences and as a result would be difficult to predict.\u000a\u000aThe most pronounced climate shifts besides the end of the ice age is a series of climate changes during the ice age where the temperature suddenly rose 10-15 degrees in less than 10 years. The climate change lasted perhaps 1000 years, then -- bang -- the temperature fell drastically and the climate changed again.\u000a\u000aThis sudden change is called the tipping point and researchers have not been able to simulate it in their labs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have made a theoretical modelling of two different scenarios that might trigger climate change. We wanted to investigate if it could be determined whether there was an external factor which caused the climate change or whether the shift was due to an accumulation of small, chaotic fluctuations\u201d, explained Peter Ditlevsen, a climate researcher at the Niels Bohr Institute.\u000a\u000aAccording to Ditlevsen, in one scenario the climate is like a seesaw that has tipped to one side. If sufficient weight is placed on the other side the seesaw will tip -- the climate will change from one state to another. In the second scenario the climate is like a ball in a trench, which represents one climate state. Turmoil in the climate system such as storms, heat waves, heavy rainfall and the melting of ice sheets may finally push the ball over into the other trench, which represents a different climate state.\u000a\u000aCurrently, an increase in the atmospheric content of CO2 may be triggering a shift in the climate again.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Earth has not had such a high CO2 content in the atmosphere since more than 15 million years ago, when the climate was very warm and alligators lived in England,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis could mean that the climate might not just slowly gets warmer over the next 1000 years, but that major climate changes theoretically could happen within a few decades\u201d, Ditlevsen added, but stressed that his research only deals with investigating the climate of the past and not predictions of the future climate. The results have just been published in Geophysical Research Letters.

a((VLONDON: Scientists have warned that global warming could reduce rainfall , contrary to the belief that rising temperatures lead to increase in overall precipitation levels.Previous studies have shown that rainfall will increase globally by 2-3% for every degree Celsius that the Earth's surface heats up.But, scientists at the University of Leeds who looked at a range of climate change scenarios, found that rainfall may actually decline if temperature in the atmosphere continues to increase. "Clearly there's something else going on," said lead author Timothy Andrew."We found that precipitation isn't just affected by temperature change at the surface. It also responds directly to increased heating in the atmosphere," Andrews said.And because the atmosphere responds to heating much more quickly than the surface the effect on rainfall is also much faster, Andrewssaid.

a((VThe Chinese have a problem. They are ageing fast and one-child policy hasnt helped. Such an adverse demographic shift, where a country greys before it becomes rich, has serious socio-economic consequences. Many years ago, Albert Maslow postulated a hierarchy of needs, first in a 1943 paper and then in a 1954 book. Physiological needs come first. The world of psychology may have debated and empirically tested Maslows postulates, however, we do know at different levels of development, priorities are different. Water-borne diseases may be important at a certain level of income, life-style diseases at another.\u000a\u000aJohn Snow (1813-58) lived in 19th century England, when people knew little about infectious diseases like cholera. In 2003, a poll among British doctors voted Snow as the greatest physician of all time. Snow taught us the importance of clean drinking water and sanitation, a lesson India still hasnt imbibed. Should India worry more about health outcomes resulting from these improvements and existence of malnutrition, or should we be concerned about high cholesterol This is also true of environment. Simon Kuznets (Nobel Laureate in 1971) is associated with two curves. The first correlates inequality with per capita income and suggests that, as development proceeds, inequality first increases and then declines.\u000a\u000aThe second is an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), not suggested by Kuznets himself, but named after him because it exhibits the same inverse-U pattern. This has also been empirically tested and has been found to hold for some variables connected with the environment, though not all. Environmental measures and policies are no longer part of WTO negotiations in the sense that they were originally suggested in Singapore in 1996 or Seattle in 1999. What was the Indian reaction when developed countries proposed inclusion of labour and environmental standards These were perceived as thinly disguised attempts at protectionism. At our level of development, we arent ready for these. Open up your markets. Allow our exports, so that we attain higher levels of per capita income. We will then begin to attach premiums to environment and labour.\u000a\u000aNegotiations on climate change are no different. Here is a sample, from the Joint Statement of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) environment ministers at Cape Town on April 25, 2010. Ministers were of the view that it will not be possible to deal with mitigation actions by developing countries, without also dealing with support for those actions and the two-fold commitments by developed countries to both provide finance for developing countries and reduce their own emissions, with consequences of non-fulfilment.\u000a\u000aFairly explicitly, a trade-off between environment and growth is stressed and without directly mentioning Kuznets, EKC is brought in, emphasising that because of concerns of equity between developed and developing countries, developed countries shouldnt push environment too hard. Fair enough and it is a compelling argument. By the same token, environment should be less of a concern in Indias backward states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa), because poverty and non-development are major issues there. One cannot have one kind of logic for international negotiations and another for domestic policy. As a country, we are rich in labour resources. Therefore, as developed countries, dont use NTBs (and other means) to restrict our exports of labour-intensive products. Most (though not all) of Indias poorer states are rich in mineral resources. However, sitting here in Delhi, we will not allow those to be exploited. We will resist environmental standards when they are perceived to be imposed by the developed world from the outside. But we have now internalised the process and we will therefore impose environmental standards on poorer states. Who should be the right entity to take a decision about the trade-off Should it be the ministry of environment & forests (ME&F)\u000a\u000aForests and protection of wild animals and birds figure in the Concurrent List and mines figure in both the Union and State lists. Quite often, protecting environment is about appropriate property rights (interpreted as decentralisation) and right prices. Indian systems are inordinately centralised, a legacy of colonial times. Ostensibly, we have a decentralised constitutional system in place. It is just that government doesnt believe in decentralisation and planning from down upwards. Witness the way ME&F treats reserve forests. Witness the way Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act of 2006 diluted the original Bill (and recommendations of a JPC) and reduced role of the gram sabha, circumventing spirit of PESA, too. Hence, let us not mix up issues.\u000a\u000aYes, tribals should be consulted when exploitation of mineral resources is planned. But no, ME&F sitting in Delhi should not determine their destiny. By allowing ME&F this role, we have ensured Indias backward areas become green before they become rich. Or more accurately, they remain green without becoming rich. In a perverse way, ME&F has accomplished what we didnt want developed countries to do.\u000a\u000aThe author is a noted economist

a((VThe UN climate panel should make predictions only when it has solid evidence and should avoid policy advocacy, scientists said in a report on Monday that called for thorough reform of the body.\u000a\u000aThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was widely criticised after admitting its 2007 global warming report wrongly said Himalayan glaciers would vanish by 2035 and that it overstated how much of the Netherlands is below sea level.\u000a\u000aSuch firm forecasts should be made only when there is sufficient evidence, said a review group supported by the academies of science from the United States, Netherlands, Britain and around 100 other countries.\u000a\u000aCritics of the idea of mandatory limits on so-called greenhouse gas emissions have said the IPCC errors show the science behind global warming is questionable.\u000a\u000aThe UN has been concerned about that focusing only on errors by the panel, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice-president Al Gore for work on global warming, could undermine the broader UN message that climate change is a real phenomenon requiring urgent action.\u000a\u000aThe report said the IPCCs mandate calls for it to be policy relevant without advocating specific policies. But some senior IPCC officials have been criticised for remarks that appeared to support specific policy approaches.\u000a\u000aStraying into advocacy can only hurt IPCCs credibility, the report said.\u000a\u000aThe review said the limit of two six-year terms for the chair of the IPCC, currently Rajendra Pachauri of India, was too long and should be shortened to one term, as should the terms of other senior officials on the UN climate panel.\u000a\u000aThe report did not call for replacing Pachauri, the IPCC chairman since 2002. Asked if he would resign if requested to by the IPCCs 194 member states in October when they discuss the scientists recommendations, Pachauri told reporters he would abide by any decision the UN climate panel made.\u000a\u000aThe report also called for an overhaul of the panels management, including the creation of an executive committee that would include people from outside the IPCC.\u000a\u000aThe review touched on concerns about Pachauris work as an adviser and board member for energy firms, as well as IPCC scientists reviewing their own work. The report noted the IPCC lacks a conflict of interest policy and recommended it adopt a rigorous one to avoid biases.\u000a\u000aUN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has acknowledged there were mistakes in what is known as the Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007, a document of more than 3,000 pages that cited more than 10,000 scientific papers. But he has insisted its fundamental conclusions were correct.\u000a\u000aBans office issued a statement welcoming the review of the IPCC and reiterating he firmly maintains that the fundamental science on climate change remains sound.\u000a\u000aHarold Shapiro, a Princeton University professor and chair of the committee that reviewed the IPCCs work, told reporters one IPCC report contains many statements that were assigned high confidence but for which there is little evidence.\u000a\u000aShapiro said the IPCCs response to errors when they were subsequently revealed was slow and inadequate. The errors, he said, Did dent the credibility of the process.\u000a\u000aAsked about the Himalayan glaciers error, Shapiro said: In our judgment, it came from just not paying close enough attention to what (peer) reviewers said about that example.\u000a\u000aPachauri said the IPCC will be strengthened by the (scientists) review and others of its kind this year.\u000a\u000aBut Shapiro made clear the review did not assess the validity of the science behind the IPCC reports, leaving open the possibility the panel could face a new wave of attacks from its critics.\u000a\u000aThe next IPCC report on climate change will be published in 2013 and 2014.

a((VDatamonitor's latest survey titled 'Green Consumers in India\u2019 finds that the Indian consumer is increasingly getting conscious about using According to the survey, making green choices is a high priority for around 60 per cent of Indian consumers. And 95 per cent of consumers who make green choices claim to do so to protect the environment.\u000a\u000aThe study reveals that the number of consumers willing to switch to using green products and services is increasing and will continue to increase over the coming years.\u000a\u000aThis report provides an analysis of the Indian consumers' attitude towards green practices, products and services across, mainly, three sectors- energy, retail and transport. It also rates different consumer segments by assigning them green scores, based on their level of adoption of green behavior across these sectors.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCommenting on the findings of the report, Gaurav Grover, analyst, Datamonitor\u2019s Sustainability team says, \u201cConsumers\u2019 concern about the environment has been on the rise in the country. Over 85 per cent of consumers in the country consider human activities to be the primary factor driving climate change, and more than half say that air pollution is their primary environmental concern.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAkhil Sivanandan, analyst, adds, \u201cOver half the consumers feel that India\u2019s automotive industry has the greatest potential to make an impact on the environment by reducing carbon emissions.\u201dThe report further indicates that women and urban dwellers are more inclined towards adopting green behavior across the three sectors as compared to men and the rural population. It also predicts that consumers in the 35\u201354 years age group will be surpass other age groups in adoption of green practices across the three sectors.As per the Green Scores, India scores higher than most except China. Since, the Chinese consumers adopt green practices such as buying environment-friendly cars and using green energy at home more willingly as compared to Indians.As a final word, Grover adds, \u201cIndia therefore, seems to have a large potential for green products and services. Competitive pricing and targeted marketing campaigns are expected to drive the growth of the market.\u201d

a((VUN climate panel chief Rajendra Pachauri, facing criticism for errors in a landmark report, has refused to quit, saying that he will remain with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change till the fifth report is produced in 2014.\u000a\u000a"At the moment, my mandate is very very clear. I have to complete the fifth assessment and now I feel that I have an additional responsibility in seeing that the reforms are carried forward on the strength of the IAC (InterAcademy Council) recommendations," Pachauri said.\u000a\u000a"Till such time that I see anything different, I feel the task that I have begun is something that I can't walk away from," he said.\u000a\u000aPachauri was responding to queries yesterday about how he intended to implement several recommendations made by the InterAcademy Council, which conducted a review of the working of the IPCC following widespread criticism stemming from erroneous conclusions in its fourth report.\u000a\u000aFollowing a review of the procedure and processes of the IPCC, the InterAcademy Council committee released a report on Monday, which urged "fundamental changes" to the management of the IPCC.\u000a\u000aThese recommendations included cutting down the tenure of chair of the IPCC, which currently consists of two six-year terms.\u000a\u000aThe committee, however, stressed that its present conclusion was not based on media reports that had raised questions about Pachauri's earnings from his consultancies with carbon trading companies and calls by some groups that he should resign. "An organisation like this needs to have its leadership constantly changed to increase the vitality here," said Harold Shapiro, chair of InterAcademy Council committee, adding that the suggestion was "not in anyway connected to Pachauri or any other leader of the IPCC."\u000a\u000aPachauri emphasised that the recommendations would have to be debated by the 194 governments of the IPCC at the upcoming meeting in Busan, South Korea in October.\u000a\u000a"These will be debated by all the governments of the world and they would then decide what's to be implemented, when it is to be implemented," the scientist said. "I am in no position to speculate on what that decision would be." "I have been elected to continue the fifth assessment process. But I am a servant of the IPCC and of course I shall decide abide by any decision that the ICC takes," he added.\u000a\u000aThe InterAcademy, founded in 2002, assembles leading scientists and engineers from all nations to provide peer-reviewed advice to international bodies. The review of the IPCC's working method was set up in March following the discovery of exaggerated claims in the fourth report of the scientific body.

a((VKOLKATA: The unplanned and unchecked real estate growth on EM Bypass and its adjoining areas, sans basic civic amenities , could spell disaster across the city, says a World Bank report submitted to the state government.It outlines how climate change and global warming are pushing these areas "to the brink of civic disaster".This first-of-its-kind study was conducted in some of the major cities in the country and identified Kolkata's environment as the most vulnerable and has a grim forecast for the Kolkata of 2050.The study warns that those who have either bought or plan to buy homes along EM Bypass and other areas of the eastern fringes, like Tiljala, Topsia, Tangra and Pagladanga (Wards 58, 59, 65, 66) could be the worst hit by environmental degradation because of rapid real estate growth sans a matching improvement in civic amenities.State chief environment officer Debal Roy said the World Bank study factored in Kolkata's social, economic and environmental circumstances. While identifying areas vulnerable to climate change, the team considered the state of a locality's drainage and sewerage systems and its hygiene standards. They were alarmed to find that ponds in eastern fringes are being filled up to make way for buildings that are being constructed in an unplanned manner in an area without a proper drainage system. Repeated waterlogging and accumulation of garbage is slowly degrading the environment.Based on the report, the environment department is framing a new state action plan on climate change, Roy said. The department has been working on these lines for some time and had come out with a report a few years ago on ways to improve conditions in areas like Tiljala and Topsia. It recently decided to make it mandatory for billboards to be solar-powered. Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said Kolkata Municipal Corporation would implement recommendations to improve the environment and include these measures in its own environment protection plan.The World Bank had earlier sanctioned Rs 347 crore for development of Bengal's coastal areas after the state submitted an integrated coastal zone management plan. The environment department is preparing poverty alleviation and skill development schemes for the coastal population. The government has taken an initiative on energy conservation, particularly for high-rise and multi-storied buildings in the hospitality sector.

a((VIn a bid to cut down carbon emissions, the aviation regulator has asked airlines to become fuel-efficient.\u000a\u000aThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) last week issued a circular directing domestic carriers to make in-house operational changes in order to discipline fuel usage.\u000a\u000aBy mid-October, all domestic carriers should submit reports of their fuel consumption patterns. Every quarter the regulator will review their performance.\u000a\u000aAir traffic contributes about 3 per cent of green house gas (GHG) emissions in the world. There is no researched data on what part Indian air traffic plays to that but projections show the country is amongst the few nascent markets to grow at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent in next five years.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are at a crucial stage. It is a good time to discipline out fuel usage,\u201d said a DGCA official requesting anonymity, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Using eco-friendly fuel is one of the most important changes suggested in the circular.\u000a\u000aAccording to the International Air Transport Association, the world\u2019s biggest airline lobby, expects its member to replace 10 per cent of aircraft jet fuel with alternative fuels by 2017.\u000a\u000aLast year four international member airlines had already experimented with biofuel mixes of jatropha, algae, or coconut oil, often blended with kerosene.\u000a\u000aIATA expects that the usage of such biofuels could potentially reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint by 80 per cent.\u000a\u000aCurrently, a single person\u2019s return journey from Mumbai to Delhi on an economic class ticket bears a carbon footprint of 246.12 kg.\u000a\u000aThe DGCA has suggested simple measures such as keeping the engine and airframe clean, using fuel-efficient airplanes such as the Airbus A 380 and cutting down flights on routes with low passenger loads.\u000a\u000aIt has already enforced rules that punish airlines for delays in order to eliminate fuel wastage because of circling above airports or waiting endlessly on tarmacs.\u000a\u000a\u201cAirlines until now used to solely blame air congestion for bad fuel efficiency. That excuse will not work anymore,\u201d said a senior official with the civil aviation ministry, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to the media.

a((VCleared of financial wrongdoing, R K Pachauri , who heads the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change , is weighing reforms put forth by a UN-ordered probe.\u000a\u000aYou have emerged unscathed out of the accusations about your role as chairman of the IPCC...\u000a\u000aWhat are the key flaws the report (set up by the UN secretary-general and IPCC) has pointed out that IPCC how needs to work on?\u000a\u000aWhat's your view on this?\u000a\u000aAnything in the UN probe report you completely or partly disagree with?\u000a\u000aDoes this raise a larger issue of how science is used by society? And is there a political guidance to it?\u000a\u000aStifling politics out of science, does that make it devoid of its real social purpose?\u000a\u000aWhat are the new elements in the next climate assessment report (due in 2014)?\u000a\u000aAren't you treading on more dangerous territory with this, because this is the most contentious bit of the negotiations \u2014 the North South divide?\u000a\u000aSo the issue of equity is central to the next report?\u000a\u000aIn the case of Sunday Telegraph, I had to pursue the case legally. I had no choice but to retain a firm of legal specialists who are strong on defamation cases and they pursued it. They (Telegraph) have also agreed to pay the legal fee of something like £53,000. It didn't happen by itself, which is unfortunate. They had published a pack of lies and there was absolutely no basis to it and their intention was to damage my reputation. I have just had to persevere and I had to keep my cool and remain determined. I am glad that finally, the truth has come out.There are two sets of recommendations. One, I would call fairly significant, like they have suggested that we have an executive committee which is empowered to take decisions between the sessions of the panel. In 2006, I had established something called the E-Team or the executive team of the panel comprising the chairs and the co-chairs and so on. So, essentially, they have formalized what I had done and I am very happy about that.The other recommendations are frankly only in terms of merely implementing our own procedures a little more rigorously. They have also suggested that the term of the top team \u2014 chairman, co-chair of the working groups and what they have suggested as the executive director should be there for only one assessment cycle.This is an issue that has to be looked at from a variety of angles. They have said that changing the team will bring some freshness in approach. But, I think you really have to weigh the consequences of experience versus a completely new team and the whole issue of institutional memory. After all, an institution like this has to bring out one assessment report after the other, building on the previous one, building on the experiences and what happened in the past. So it's a set of issues the panel will have to consider very carefully.They have talked about quantifying uncertainties. To some extent, we are doing that, though not perfectly. But the issue is that in some cases, you really don't have a quantitative base by which you can attach a probability or a level of uncertainty that defines things in quantitative terms. And there, let's not take away the importance of expert judgment. And that is something the report has missed or at least not pointed out.Sure...Let's face it, we are an intergovernmental body and our strength and acceptability of what we produce is largely because we are owned by governments. If that was not the case, then we would be like any other scientific body that maybe producing first-rate reports but don't see the light of the day because they don't matter in policy-making. Now clearly, if it's an inter-governmental body and we want governments' ownership of what we produce, obviously they will give us guidance of what direction to follow, what are the questions they want answered. Unfortunately, people have completely missed the original resolution by which IPCC was set up. It clearly says that our assessment should include realistic response strategies. If that is not an assessment of policies, then what does it represent? And I am afraid, we have been, in my view, defensive in coming out with a whole range of policies and I am not saying we prescribe policy A or B or C but on the basis of science, we are looking at realistic response strategies.But that is exactly what this committee has recommended that we get out of \u2014 policy prescriptions. It is for this reason that I brought out that this what is written in the IPCC mandate. This is a misperception on the part of some people in the scientific community. And I hope I can correct it.Some of things that are certainly going to be included this time are issues of equity. It's yet to be accepted by the panel, so I can't really say definitely. At the meeting, we dwelt at length on Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which says the central objective of the convention is to prevent the anthropogenic interference with the climate system which is in terms of ecosystem, ensuring food security and ensuring that development can take place. These are three central pillars. This is something that science can't answer. Because what is perceived as dangerous, depends on value judgements. But science can provide as much information as possible by which the negotiators and decision-makers can decide what is dangerous and we are trying very hard to get this together.It is but I also believe this is something the IPCC must do. And I must say I owe it to what has happened over the past few months that I have certainly shed any inhibitions or feelings of cowardice. I believe this is now my opportunity to go out and do what I think is right. In the second term I may be little more uncomfortable for the people than I was in the first. Maybe they realize it.Certainly, but not only equity, we have also used the word 'ethics'. There are certain ethical dimensions, even of the scientific assessment of climate change which we are going to try and assess.

a((VOne way of framing the complexity of China\u2019s long history is to understand it as the interplay of ideas between the pragmatic, human-centric precepts of Confucianism and the nature-worshipping, harmony-seeking philosophy of Daoism.\u000a\u000aThis dichotomy between values that stress conquering nature for human benefit and those that emphasise the importance of seeking a sustainable balance between man and nature is mirrored in the modern-day clash between the mainstream advocates of GDP-before-all-else and the swelling ranks of eco-warriors.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian\u2019s Asia correspondent Jonathan Watts\u2019 new book is an eco-travelogue across the denuded topography of what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy, detailing the environmental consequences for and the world of a Confucian victory over Daoism.\u000a\u000aThe benefits of China\u2019s economic miracle are well documented: the lifting of 400 million-plus people out of poverty, the financial salvation of multinational companies selling everything from burgers to cars, a re-orientalisation of the world away from its West-centric tilt.\u000a\u000aBut Watts\u2019 travels tell another, less uplifting story. As he wanders from the deserts of Gansu and Ningxia in the north to the manufacturing hubs of the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas in the south, Watts elaborates a depressing catalogue of foul air, choking waterways, disappearing bio-diversity, ballooning urban waste and its terrible costs for human health.\u000a\u000aIn 2007, the World Bank estimated the cost of pollution in to be equivalent to 5.8 per cent of its GDP annually, taking into account health costs, 700,000 premature deaths a year and damage to crops and infrastructure.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s rivers are running dry and black, its 87,000 dams creating as many problems as they solve. The country\u2019s air is so poisonous that lung cancer rates are galloping. Grasslands are turning into dusty deserts, forcing the relocation of millions of people. Entire species are vanishing, the Yangtze dolphin amongst them.\u000a\u000aAs China\u2019s GDP swells and its people join the ranks of the global consuming class, nature is the loser, says Watts. The country\u2019s march to GDP supremacy is ensuring that natural resources are gobbled up at an unprecedented scale and speed.\u000a\u000aYet, his conclusions are difficult. In its rush to get rich, may have polluted and ravaged the environment in the best western tradition, but what would the alternative have looked like? Seven hundred thousand people may die prematurely due to the health effects of pollution today, but were China to have remained mired in poverty and famine, would its population be any more healthy?\u000a\u000aThe problem is that while Watts is disparaging of the rich world\u2019s favoured strategy of \u201cget rich first, clean up later\u201d, there is no precedent for an alternative model of development.\u000a\u000aTelling a country that its citizens must change their habits and consume less when they still have so little smacks of the unfairness that underlies much of the global discourse on climate change and other environmental issues. As a foreign correspondent in Beijing, Watts and his colleagues have privileged lives. While they may not consume as much as some of the new-rich in the big Chinese cities, they nonetheless live a comfortable existence peppered with air-conditioning and bottled water.\u000a\u000aTo Watts\u2019 credit, he admits the underlying unfairness of the situation. China, he says, is extraordinarily unfortunate to be hitting this particular stage of development at this time in human history.\u000a\u000aWatts\u2019 conclusions are stark but he does leave some room for grey. As he travels across the country, the people he meets are optimistic and overwhelmingly believe their lives are getting better even as they cough from blackened lungs and the despair of having to drill ever deeper into the earth to obtain water.\u000a\u000aHe also sees some signs of China emerging as a green superpower with businesses taking the lead in developing alternative energies and the country\u2019s leadership increasingly making the right sounds. But overall, he tends to pessimism, believing Beijing\u2019s new environmentalism to be akin to putting a bandage on a broken arm. The focus in China, he says, is on increasing the efficiency of the old model rather than developing a new model.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Watts\u2019 arguments appear to boil down to the cold fact that China is different from other countries because it has so many people. The population of China is twice as large today than that of the entire world in 1750, he says. With finite global resources, the assault of a population this big is what appears to be at the heart of the country\u2019s environmental stress as it seeks to feed and provide water for its mass of humanity. Watts\u2019 Malthusian sympathies are evident in the title of the book itself, conjuring up the spectre of a billion Chinese jumping in catastrophic unison.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the book, Watts is honest enough to ask himself whether his perceptions are coloured more by the Chinese government\u2019s propaganda or his own \u201cWestern, liberal, middle aged prejudices\u201d. While some readers might well conclude the latter, the book is full of sobering, thought-provoking scenarios all of which are deeply relevant to India and its environment as the country embraces its own brand of GDPism.\u000a\u000aWHEN A BILLION CHINESE JUMP\u000a\u000aHow China will save mankind or destroy it\u000a\u000aJonathan Watts\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFaber and Faber, 2010483 pages; £14.99

a((VNEW DELHI: Away from the centrestage occupied by the climate finance dialogue, an informal ministerial on biological diversity was also taking place in Geneva . Biogical diversity, which gets far less attention than climate change, plays a crucial role in maintaining the \u201cbenign conditions\u201d that are necesary for the well being and survival of the human species. The ministerial stressed the need for \u201cimmediate action\u201d as \u201cfate\u201d of biodiversity \u201cfor the millennia to come\u201d would be determined by the \u201caction or inaction over the next decade or two\u201d.The one-day Geneva meeting was attended by 11 ministers of countries that have held or will hold the presidency of the conference of parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity . Environment minister Jairam Ramesh was among those participating in the ministerial as India will hold the presidency in 2012-14.The news is not good. The third Global Biodiversity Outlook, which was released in May, came up for discussion at the meet. The outlook is grim. It states that human actions are putting a strain on the environment, such that the \u201cability of the planet\u2019s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted\u201d. Worse still the there appears to be no easing up on the pressures which are leading to loss of biodiversity. The issues of climate change and biodiversity loss are inextricably linked. Each can exacerbate the impacts of the other, but at the same time there are policy options that can address both issues.In what was a cause for \u201cextreme concern\u201d for the ministerial, the Outlook states that \u201cthe consequences of current trends are much worse than previously thought.\u201d Should current trends persist over the next decade, several \u201ctipping points\u201d will be reached before the end of the century. This will cause \u201cirreparable damage to the ability of major ecosystems to continue providing their goods and services.\u201dIn view of the urgent situation, the ministerial in its declaration has appealed to world leaders to do more for biodiversity by committing themselves to a common long-term vision and short-term mission for biodiversity and to global, regional and national targets to be achieved. In order to ensure implementation of the new biodiversity strategy, the ministers called for a strategy for resource mobilisation. The aim is to ensure adequate and predictable financial resources, and technology transfer, to developing countries.The Geneva ministerial has asked that equal attention be given to three objectives of the Convention\u2014the conservation of biological diversity; the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilisation of genetic resources.This ministerial, being held just ahead of the tenth meet of the signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity, sought to underscore the importance of finalising a global biodiversity agreement at the October meet in Nagoya, Japan. The Geneva ministerial has also decided to support Tokyo's initiative to recommend to the UN to consider declaring 2011-2020 as the 'International Decade for Biodiversity'.

a((VVARANASI: The Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) has joined hands with the Banaras Hindu University ( BHU ) to promote better understanding of vegetation-environment relationship, including development of predictive ability to study the vegetation response to the climate change.While BHU vice-chancellor D P Singh inaugurated the ISRO-funded automated agromet weather station (AMS) at the Rajiv Gandhi South Campus (RGSC), Barkachha (Mirzapur), on Friday, it also marked the start of the first activity of the newly established Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development (IESD) in the university.As per A S Raghubanshi, coordinator, IESD, BHU, the AMS would work with the help of a 10-metre tall micrometeorological tower, installed at RGSC, that also became functional on Friday.The data collected through the sensors placed at various sites in the biodiversity park of the RGSC would be uplinked every hour to the AMS transmitter of INSAT/KALPANA-1 satellite and again retransmitted through the extended C-band transponder to the earth station at Ahmedabad, said Raghubanshi.It may be mentioned here that the installation of AMS at RGSC (BHU) is a part of ISRO-sponsored nationwide 24 automated weather stations. The AMS has sensors capable of measuring radiation, energy and soil-water balance components continuously with a total of 26 quantities at half-an-hour interval.For this, the sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, soil temperature, moisture and heat flux have already been placed at various sites in the biodiversity park of the RGSC.According to J S Parihar, deputy director of ISRO-Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad, a databank of ISRO-agromet observations is being created at Ahmedabad which would soon be made accessible to the internet users.He also emphasised that characterising the exchanges in energy, water and carbon dioxide within vegetation and atmospheric surface is important in developing the predictive ability to study the vegetation response to the climate change, which would be done through the station.R P Singh, a scientist at SAC, said the data generated by the network would help in understanding the effect of vegetation climate using remote sensing and process based modelling.A number of senior university officials including rector B D Singh and officer on special duty (OSD) Onkar Singh were also present during the inauguration programme.Make BHU a world-class varsity: V-C to students, teacherstimes news networkVaranasi: Reaching the top is difficult but retaining the top position is even more difficult, said BHU vice-chancellor D P Singh while addressing the students, teachers and non-teaching employees at the RGSC, Barkaccha, in the new academic session (2010-11) on Friday.Referring to the recent visit of US Ambassador to India, Timothy J Roemer to the university, the vice-chancellor emphasised that the university has attracted worldwide attention and the onus for making it a world-class varsity rests with the students and teachers.He said that the BHU is the first university to come up with a set of environmental policies.Earlier, he also inaugurated the BPharma (Ayurveda) laboratory at the RGSC.A number of senior university officials including director, Institute of Medical Science (IMS), T M Mohapatra, and dean, faculty of ayurveda, V K Joshi were also present on the occasion.

a((VIn an important step toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions,the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI),an international partnership of information and communications technology (ICT) companies,today unveiled a methodology for evaluating the carbon-reducing potential of new ICT initiatives.\u000a\u000aThis practical tool,prepared by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on behalf of GeSI,with assistance from WSP Environment & Energy,aims to provide businesses,policy makers and the ICT industry with a common yardstick for assessing carbon emissions savings arising from ICT-based solutions such as smart motors,smart logistics,smart buildings,and smart power grids.\u000a\u000aAccording to GeSI’s ground-breaking SMART 2020 report,published in 2008,ICT solutions have the potential to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 15% and save up to €600 billion ($750 billion) by 2020. The follow-up methodology announced today,provides specific guidance on how to identify and quantify the potential benefits of an ICT solution. With its focus on simplifying assessment,and a practical online tutorial,the approach aims to promote greater alignment among ICT companies,government officials,planners,and policy makers.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on the eve of the global report launch,Luis Neves,GeSI Chair,stated,“ICT innovation encourages a low carbon economy,efficiency,and preservation of our environment. This tool will help us to assess emission reductions,and to refine ICT applications so that they can deliver even more net carbon savings.”\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VUpdated: Sun, Sep 05 2010. 09 52 PM IST\u000a\u000aThe battle for climate change last decade was pitched. Green activists pushed for a new morality of organic foods and biomass fuels; sceptics and outright deniers pushed back, often with equal ideological fervour. Caught in the crossfire was a reasoned debate, one where policymakers would be aware of the challenges here. Without enough consideration, they launched head-on into a much-touted conference at Copenhagen in December.\u000a\u000aThat conference collapsed. Now perhaps the old polarized debate is starting to collapse, too. Last week saw two giants on opposite ends of the spectrum cut down to size.\u000a\u000aTake Rajendra Pachauri who, as head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the world\u2019s leading climate change proponent. The January scandal now called Himalayagate (IPCC\u2019s loud assertion that glaciers would melt by 2035) has dented its credibility. An independent review released last Monday couldn\u2019t help notice that IPCC makes claims with \u201chigh confidence\u201d, but \u201cweak evidentiary basis\u201d.\u000a\u000aThen take Bjorn Lomborg, whose The Skeptical Environmentalist (2002), established him as the world\u2019s leading critic. While he doesn\u2019t deny global warming, Lomborg earlier argued that it shouldn\u2019t be a top policy priority: Starting in 2004, he asked economists to look at better ways to spend $50 billion. Yet, last week, The Guardian reported a voluntary about-turn. His next book, out this month, notes that global warming is so big a challenge that world governments should actually be spending $100 billion a year.\u000a\u000aSo where does that leave this debate?\u000a\u000aClimate change can\u2019t be denied. But because the world knows so little about the nature of this threat, it\u2019s never been clear how much or what kind of insurance policymakers should buy to protect against it. The challenges of understanding here can be overwhelming. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for research to keep evolving.\u000a\u000aSimon Dietz, Geoffrey Heal and Antony Millner echo the uncertainty around this debate in a VoxEU.org research piece this month. But they point to another challenge: When policymakers encounter uncertainty, their aversion to academic ambiguity could force them to support strong measures. While the world has a chance to debate this issue anew, policymakers should make sure they don\u2019t unnecessarily whip up excitement for another Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aWhere is this debate headed?

a((VNEW DELHI: Hope of progress on a global climate deal at the year-end Cancun summit is rapidly dimming with rich countries backtracking on their commitment to provide climate funds. Finance is a key issue for rebuilding trust among developing and developed countries.The two-day informal Geneva Dialogue on Climate Finance held late last week focused on sources of long-term climate finance, particularly the role of public and private funds. The developing world is concerned about the increased emphasis by industrialised countries on private sources and markets for climate funds.There is hesitation on the part of the rich countries to commit public funds on account of global financial crisis and the ensuing austerity cuts.Environment minister Jairam Ramesh , who attended the meeting, cautioned industrialised countries not to walk away from their commitment because of the current financial crisis. According to Mr Ramesh, the Geneva meeting was \u201cnot a productive event\u201d as there was \u201ca conscious effort by developed countries to underplay finance and overplay the role of markets in climate finance.\u201dIndustrialised countries are going back on their funding commitments made in Copenhagen. The developed countries had pledged to provide $30 billion as fast-track finance between 2010 and 2012 for poor developing countries. This was supposed to be new and additional funds.In the Copenhagen Accord, the industrialised countries had pledged to mobilise $100 billion every year by 2020 to help fund climate change action in developing countries. This money was to be raised from a \u201cwide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of funding.\u201dSince the December 2009 climate summit there has been a concerted push to look to markets to raise climate funds. The industrialised countries have consistently pushed for a greater role of markets in climate finance. The European Union has been a prime mover for increased role of markets.The pitch has become louder in view of the global crisis. This is not a viable option for the developing world, particularly the most vulnerable and the least developed.\u201cThe whole financing game, with the financial squeeze in the developed countries, there is an attempt to redefine their obligations as part of paragraph 5 in the Copenhagen Accord,\u201d Mr Ramesh stressed.This attempt to redefine obligations is bound to have repercussions on the global climate talks, which has been dogged by an absence of trust between the developed and developing world. UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres acknowledges that finance is of critical importance for rebuilding trust between the rich developed and poor developing countries.\u201cIf there is anybody who is backtracking on the Copenhagen agreement it is the Americans and the Europeans because they are reinterpreting the $100 billion by 2020.By and large financing for adaptation has necessarily to be public financing, while mitigation will involve a mix of public and private funds.Now they are trying to redefine the $100 billion by saying that if we come with ten billion and leverage the remaining $90 billion, we have met our target of $100 billion,\u201d Mr Ramesh said.Industrialised countries have argued that new "innovative" sources were always part of the long-term financing promise. The rich industrialised countries have suggested that \u201cemerging\u201d countries contribute to providing resources for climate financing. This is not acceptable to India and China, two key advanced developing countries.The financial crisis has also cast doubt on how much of the $30 billion fast track finance is actually new and additional. "With the growing financial crisis in the developed countries, there is a visible backtracking on the public component of $ 100 billion and they are also redefining 'new and additional funds,\u201d Mr Ramesh said.There is growing apprehension that developed countries are re-routing existing developmental aid as climate fund. Ms Figueres, who also attended the Geneva meet said that the developing countries expectation that the fast track finance would \u201ccompletely new and additional\u201d was \u201cvery justifiable\u201d.Global climate talks have been hamstrung due to the slow progress and lack of clarity on funding for developing countries. Finance is one of the building blocks of the Bali Action Plan. Headway on funding of climate action is crucial for a global deal.The Geneva dialogue was one of the informal ministerial being organised by Mexico, which holds the presidency of the 16th Conference of parties under the UNFCCC. These meetings are not part of the UNFCCC negotiations process but efforts to provide a constructive atmosphere for discussions and regaining trust in order to breathe life into the stalled process.

a((VPromoting energy-efficient technologies to reach the of 50 per cent reduction from 2005 energy-related emission levels by 2050 is the aim of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, a non-government organisation advising 28 member-countries. Its executive director, Nobuo Tanaka, who in his earlier role as a Japanese diplomat oversaw the implementation of Japan\u2019s international nuclear energy policy and led negotiations of bilateral nuclear agreements, spoke to Jyoti Mukul and Sudheer Pal Singh on India\u2019s energy challenges. Edited excerpts:\u000a\u000aIEA in its report has suggested that decarbonising the electricity sector will involve use of nuclear and renewable energy and increasing the share of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to coal plants. How do you compare nuclear versus renewable energy for a country like India?\u000a\u000aWe need all the options. India needs energy efficiency first. Then comes renewable energy, which has different applications; India has hydro and solar. In Europe and the US, maybe wind (energy) is more applicable. It depends on a country, whether it is willing to take the nuclear option. In our Blue Map scenario, half the power will be generated by renewable, the other half by nuclear and CCS. If we can do more renewable, you can have less nuclear and if you can do more CCS, you can have less nuclear. We feel nuclear is a very important option globally, if we have to reduce CO2 emissions by half till 2050.\u000a\u000aNuclear power must be as safe as possible. Safety is a major issue. Also, there is another consideration, the non-proliferation requirement. These two requirements are very important.\u000a\u000aThe Indian Parliament recently passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill. Industry is of the view that with the increase in liability, companies will be deterred from supplying equipment. Do you think the apprehension is correct?\u000a\u000aIt depends on how law is going to be implemented. For example, if a defect is found in the nuclear reactor or product, certainly supplier is responsible for that but if it because of human error of the operator then he may not be responsible. Already they have some responsibility resulting in regulation. One has to see how this legislation is interpreted and implemented. The industry response will depend on how it is interpreted.\u000a\u000aWhat is the way out?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNuclear power must be as safe as possible. Safety is a major issue. Also there is another consideration like non-proliferation requirement. These two requirements are very important conditions.\u000a\u000aHow should the issue of liability be addressed?\u000a\u000aIt depends on different countries. Certainly, if you need safer and better facilities, it may be one idea. But does it really help supplier to supply more and what is the cost implication of that? There are plenty of issues which could be considered in the implementation. A lot things could come up during implementation.\u000a\u000aWould increase in liability increase insurance cost and consumer price?\u000a\u000aIf it is implemented as such, cost for the supplier could increase and that means cost to consumers could increase.\u000a\u000aIndia is a price-sensitive market, where it is important to make power affordable for a large section that does not have access to electricity. How far is it feasible to reduce dependence on cheaper coal-based power generation?\u000a\u000aIt is an important point. To reduce coal power usage by using carbon capture storage on coal power plants, there is need for a carbon price or cost. The CO2 emission must be penalised by some measure\u2014carbon tax, carbon price, carbon trade mechanism. CCS needs to be made viable. In a cost-sensitive market, it is a challenge but it is a necessary price to make this technology possible.\u000a\u000aDo you think the methods adopted by the Indian government for cutting carbon emissions are good enough?\u000a\u000aThe Indian government is pledging improvement by putting up programmes for energy efficiency in buildings and developing solar priorities and nuclear (energy). There are plenty of programmes for making India move towards sustainability or a low-carbon economy. We are calculating these measures and their impact. It seems to us it is much more than India has pledged at Copenhagen. It can do more. Of course, negotiations are negotiations and we understand that but what India is planning to do for the future is much more. When you calculate the individual measures into one, then I think India can do more.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to reducing the emission level, do you think India should share the same targets as developed countries?\u000a\u000aIn our calculations in this model, Indian efficiency increase and new technologies can provide very low per capita intensity trajectory. In our assumption, India should start some kind of carbon trade measures around 2030. India needs some kind of measures to price carbon, eventually.\u000a\u000aGas and nuclear are increasingly becoming important for India but both these fuels do not compare too well with coal in terms of pricing. How can this be addressed?\u000a\u000aThis is the challenge for India. To make low-carbon options more viable, you have to put the carbon price (right) somehow, by a carbon tax or carbon trade mechanism or some kind of regulation to give more advantage to gas or renewable or nuclear. This depends on the development and potential. Each government should design support measures like feeding rates, carbon price or government R&D money. That kind of intervention is necessary to make a low-carbon power sector.\u000a\u000aAre you saying the government should offer subsidy?\u000a\u000aA kind of subsidy can be given. It depends on technology. For instance, in CCS or technology which is primitive, the government should provide R&D money. On the other hand, if wind technology is getting more commercially viable, you can do not only feeding tariff (rates) but do more tradable green certificates. Depending on the level of maturity, you have to design the right tools to support technology.\u000a\u000aHow important is price decontrol?\u000a\u000aThat is important. Energy efficiency is one of the major contributions to sustainability. Subsidy or price control disturbs the market pricing. Consumers must be given the correct signal from the market, otherwise efficiency gains will not materialise.

a((VIndia has the potential to become a global manufacturing hub for solar power equipment given its low labour cost advantage and ever-growing electricity demand. However, the country has to adopt a holistic approach to realise its potential.\u000a\u000aDrawing a clear road map for the sector, providing regulatory and policy clarity, removing supply-side bottlenecks and creating public awareness about the benefits of solar power in the fight against climate change would be the key components of an effective strategy to harness Indias potential in solar power business.\u000a\u000aThe government needs to put in place a regulatory framework and set long-term goals on solar power usage to attract serious investors into the sector. That would in turn help slash the cost of solar power generation, which is currently prohibitively high.\u000a\u000aWith tariffs for solar power still a long way off grid parity, the government has to provide incentives to help the sector take off. A long-term, consistent policy on this is a prerequisite to attracting investors.\u000a\u000aGovernment policies such as feed-in-tariff, renewable purchase obligation and tax rebates are essential for creating demand for solar power in the country, global consultancy firm Ernst & Young (E&Y) says in a recent report Conquering the Sun.\u000a\u000aBesides providing policy support, the government has to formulate policy to improve domestic availability of key inputs like polysilicon and cell for solar power project developers.\u000a\u000aBottlenecks in the availability of skilled manpower is another issue that beckons a solution.\u000a\u000aTalented and skilled professionals can be attracted to the industry through various means such as industry-awareness programmes conducted at schools and colleges. In addition, necessary courses and vocational training could be launched at colleges and other educational institutes, the report says.\u000a\u000aIndia has agreed to reduce its carbon emissions on a voluntary basis. However, it might find it a tough challenge since the country continues to depend on coal-fired generation to meet its electricity needs.\u000a\u000aWith the economy projected to grow at 8-10% over the long term, the countrys energy requirement should also rise commensurately.\u000a\u000aA switchover from coal to gas for power generation on a large scale would help. But the wide gap in domestic demand and supply of natural gas and volatility in the LNG market have held back the domestic power sector from making a desired switchover to gas based generation. The situation is not expected to improve significantly over the long term either.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, promoting the usage of solar power is a credible option for India to reduce its carbon footprint. Developing public awareness about the advantages of solar power is as important as creating generation capacity.\u000a\u000anoor.mohammad @expressindia.com

a((VAround this time last year,there was frenetic activity in the climate change circuits in the lead up to the widely anticipated summit meeting in Copenhagen,even though it had become sufficiently clear that a comprehensive and global agreement — that was the stated objective of the conference — was not going to be realised in the Danish capital. Negotiators around the world were regularly huddling together in meetings,working hard to draw the contours of an honourable deal,nations had begun making those big announcements that,they hoped,would be taken as evidence of their willingness to walk the extra mile,and even school children were discussing what a necessary outcome from Copenhagen should be.\u000a\u000aThis year has been in stark contrast. With just three months to go for the next annual climate conference — this time scheduled at the Mexican beach city of Cancun in November-December — there has been absolutely no excitement,and very little activity. It is almost as if the climate negotiations came to an end with the failure of the Copenhagen conference.\u000a\u000aNegotiators have been going through the motions and almost as many meetings have been organised since January as last year. The latest one,involving environment ministers from more than 40 countries,came to an end in Switzerland over the last weekend. But as has been the case with every other meeting this year,there has been absolutely no progress made at any of these discussions.\u000a\u000aThis despite the fact that the climate negotiations are now limited mainly around the very modest expectations for Cancun. By all accounts,Cancun would be considered a big success if it delivered on an agreed financial architecture that would ensure that the least developed countries and countries most threatened by climate change were assured of ample money from the developed and rich countries to deal with the effects of climate change. (Forget about a legally-binding comprehensive climate treaty,or even emission reduction targets for the rich countries for a period beyond 2013 when the current commitments under Kyoto Protocol come to an end). In Copenhagen,the rich countries had agreed to create two kinds of funds — a fast-start fund of US $30 billion over the period 2010-12 and long-term ‘Green Fund’ that will make available US $100 billion every year from 2020.\u000a\u000aThere has been little progress on either of these with no clarity on who was contributing how much and who was benefitting. A page showing the list of recipient countries on a newly created website on the fast-start funding is quite revealing: the column against each of the listed countries is vacant,meaning no amount has till now been pledged to any of them. The page on donor countries shows a total commitment of just over US$ 3 billion,or about 30 per cent of the funds that are supposed to be delivered,not just promised,by the end of this year. (Curiously,India’s name figures in the list of recipients,even though New Delhi has made it clear that it is not in contention for receiving these funds,which,it has stressed,must be given to the most needy countries.)\u000a\u000aIn the absence of any real action towards the global agreement — which even the most optimistic don’t see coming until the 2011 climate change conference in South Africa — climate negotiation this year has been all about smaller groups of countries,having similar interests and stakes,binding together more strongly,and agreeing to cooperate within themselves rather spend much energy in bigger talks. Accordingly,India has had several round of formal and informal discussions with other members of the so-called BASIC countries (Brazil,South Africa,India and China),the EU countries have met many times within themselves while the Latin American countries are slowly organising themselves into a formidable grouping.\u000a\u000aMany believe that the low level of expectation from the Cancun conference was actually a good thing — a blessing in disguise that promised a better chance of delivering something substantial. They are of the opinion that one of the biggest reason for the failure of Copenhagen was that it had aimed at too ambitious a target without finalising the finer details. In effect,Cancun is trying to follow an inverted approach. Aiming for the smaller agreements,which,hopefully over time,could be bound together in the form of a comprehensive and global agreement on climate change,that many believe,is still possible.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

a((VThe informal climate change ministerial talks in Geneva hosted by the Swiss government to overcome the hurdle of tong-term financing of mitigation and adaption measures and its regulation on climate change evoked mixed responses from the players and NGOs.\u000a\u000aThe success of the climate change talks in Cancun in November will hinge mainly on the funding and financial issues.\u000a\u000aIssues related to fund raising, coordination of funds and new sources of financing and how the private sector should be brought on board were discussed in the meeting among other points. Pledging of funds were on the agenda, with the US upping its offer of $7 billion from the Copenhagen pledge of $2.5 billion for the period upto 2012. Out of 45 participating countries, 20 ministers attended, including Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh.\u000a\u000aThe proposal of the North on inclusion of private funding as over public funding was controversial. Discussed were also as how such a fund can relate to existing climate funds, as well as the access to and distribution of regulation of the associated funding. Country positions were not declared openly due to the confidentiality of the talks.\u000a\u000aUnder the Copenhagen Accord finalised last December, developed countries pledged $30 billion in fast-track financing for the period 2010-2012, but the larger goal was commitment to jointly mobilising $100 billion in the long-term aid annually by 2020. The Swiss host, minister Moritz Leuenberger, was upbeat.\u000a\u000aHe said that industrialised nations are willing to pay according to the polluter-pays principle. It now depends on whether emerging nations will also contribute to the fund. NGOs were sceptical of the results. Differences cropped up between perceptions of the North and the South. Doubts exist as to whether the money pledged is not old money.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh told FE, We certainly hope that this meeting will go a long way in reducing trust deficit between countries. But, I doubt whether the Copenhagen logjam is broken. The single most important trigger for success at Cancun is the funding.\u000a\u000aHe, however, said that when it comes to funding, the issues are very complex, and the continued financial crisis is making public funding difficult. It is making countries now rethink their commitments in Copenhagen. Countries are instead talking more about private financing and carbon credits and less about public funding. Conscious efforts are being made to devalue the concept of public funding. If this mindset continues, it is unlikely that the developing countries will play ball, he said.\u000a\u000aAccording to him, public financing would continue to be a large share of developing countries desires. Countries will depend on public and private financing. At the dialogue, a large number of Latin American countries, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Brazil, opposed the devaluation of public financing. This should be fast-track fund operational before Cancun.\u000a\u000aAt the talks, use of the funds focused on the African states, the small island states and LDCs. Of the $30 billion pledged at Copenhagen, the EU will contribute $8 billion; Japan says it will put in $15 billion, and the US, which had pledged $3.2 billion earlier, has said it would go up to $7 billion.\u000a\u000aAccording to Ramesh, countries must be realistic in their expectations and might have to downsise their ambitions.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, ministers of important players ministers in the climate change talksAustralia, China, Indonesia, South Africa and the UKwere missing at the Geneva Dialogue\u000a\u000aThe US, which rejected the Kyoto Protocol, wants emerging nations such as Brazil, China and India to join in the effort and funds to cut pollution. US Special envoy Todd Stern felt that it would be a challenge to get a meaningful outcome in Cancun. The Green Fund should be efficient, effective and should not be tied down by red tape.\u000a\u000aThe Dutch government set up a website www.faststartfinance.orgo to track whether rich countries are keeping a pledge to come up with the $30 billion in fast-track climate aid for developing and poorer economies.

a((VA global report, which warned governments of major threat to food security because of erratic rainfall, has cited rejuvenation of groundwater under Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme as a success story for other countries to follow but warned against construction of big dams.\u000a\u000aA UN affiliated body, International Water Management Institute released the report on Monday, Water Storage in Era of Climate Change and has examined the recent trends of heavy rainfall and drought \u2014 terming them as a result of climate change.\u000a\u000aSome of the solutions to adverse impact of water availability in future have come from India.

Several water storage tanks, which were earlier used for water storage in arid and semi-arid tracks, were converted into re-charge ponds for underground water.\u000a\u000aThe report also said that 499 million people in Africa and India can benefit by improved water management but did not advocate construction of big dams for irrigation purpose.\u000a\u000a"Many of the 50,000 large dams built worldwide since the 1950s are intended to store water for irrigation\u2026There are the adverse social and environmental impacts, including displacement of up to 80 million people from their homes and disruption of the livelihoods of some 470 million people living downstream from dams as a result of altered river flows." the report said.\u000a\u000aThe report instead proposes an integrated approach that combines large and small-scale storage options, including the use of water from natural wetlands, water stored in the soil, groundwater and water collected in ponds, tanks, and reservoirs.\u000a\u000a"Just as modern consumers diversify their financial holdings to reduce risk, smallholder farmers need a wide array of 'water accounts' to provide a buffer against climate change impacts," said Matthew McCartney, the report's lead author and a hydrologist at the institute.\u000a\u000a"That way, if one water source goes dry, they'll have others to fall back on."

The panel is also ready with an index for measuring the \u201cgreen\u201d performance of each state and ranking them.As per this index, the hill states of Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Arunachal and Himachal along with UT Chandigarh fare the best. The index is based on review of the air and water quality in these states. Forest cover, size of national parks, along with changes in greenery pattern have all been factored in.Climate change concerns are also being integrated, and states will be assessed on the basis of their use of non-conventional energy and volume of methane emissions.At present, the Planning Commission ranks states according to fiscal performance, income levels, tax collection and certain nationally important targets besides special considerations while deciding on the allocation of Central plan funds.The index automatically pitches for those states that have seen little economic and industrial development but maintain a high green cover.In that sense, the hill states gain by default. Earlier, too, the finance commission had pointed out that the states maintaining a higher forest cover do so at the cost of their economic development, and consequently should be provided more funds for the eco-system services that they render to the rest of the country.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aUsing satellite mapping, airborne-laser technology, and ground-based plot surveys, scientists have come out with the first high-resolution maps of carbon locked up in tropical forest vegetation and emitted by land-use practices.\u000a\u000aThe project by researchers at Carnegie Institution\u2019s Department of Global Ecology, with colleagues from the World Wildlife Fund and in coordination with the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment (MINAM), has paved the way for accurate monitoring of carbon storage and emissions for the proposed United Nations initiative on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).\u000a\u000aThe new high-resolution mapping method will have a major impact on the implementation of REDD in tropical regions around the world.\u000a\u000aThe study covered over 16,600 square miles of the Peruvian Amazon-an area about the size of Switzerland. The researchers used a four-step process-they mapped vegetation types and disturbance by satellite; developed maps of 3-D vegetation structure using a LiDAR system (light detection and ranging) from the fixed-wing Carnegie Airborne Observatory; converted the structural data into carbon density using a small network of field plots on the ground; and integrated the satellite and LiDAR data for high-resolution maps of stored and emitted carbon. The scientists combined historical deforestation and degradation data with 2009 carbon stock information to calculate emissions from 1999-2009 for the Madre de Dios region.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that the total regional forest carbon storage was about 395 million metric tons and emissions reached about 630,000 metric tons per year,\u201d explained lead author Greg Asner. \u201cBut what really surprised us was how carbon storage differed among forest types and the underlying geology, all in very close proximity to one another. For instance, where the local geology is up to 60 million years old, the vegetation retains about 25% less carbon than the vegetation found on geologically younger, more fertile surfaces. We also found an important interaction between geology, land use, and emissions. These are the first such patterns to emerge from the Amazon forest,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThe scientists also found that the paving of the Interoceanic Highway, combined with selective logging and gold mining, caused an increase of deforestation emissions of more than 61 percent by 2009, while degradation emissions doubled. Forest degradation increased regional carbon emissions by 47 percent over deforestation alone. However, the researchers were able to detect an 18 percent offset to these regional emissions in forests regrowing on previously cleared and now abandoned lands.\u000a\u000aThe study is published in the latest edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

a((VThe Monsoon session witnessed the clearing of the Energy Conservation (amendment) Bill, 2010. The Bill has pushed the nation to a regime of energy tradea way perceived by many, including me, as a back-door entry to the carbon (emission) trade regime, which the nation, irrespective of the party at the helm, has opposed in all international forums, tooth and nail, till date. Characteristic of the Congress-led UPA government, the market has been given its way out, irrespective of the priority of the masses.\u000a\u000aThe Bill ostensibly proposes that the Energy Conservation Building Code will be made mandatory for all buildings with a certain level of electricity load, an approach that has a complete emphasis on demand side management. On the other hand, the manufacturers, importers and suppliers of equipment, appliances and services will be free to continue with their business-as-usual approach and perpetuate inefficient technologies for a considerable period of time. The new legislation allows one entity to trade in its surplus energy points with some other entity, which is not energy efficient. Carbon credit mechanisms on emissions are in vogue in the world and a similar action seems to have been suggested at the domestic level.\u000a\u000aThe passage of the Bill effectively means that the Indian consumers, who are already struggling because our country has become a sellers market, will be further penalised in the form of bearing the high initial cost of energy-efficiency equipment, appliances and services. If the government is really concerned about the welfare of the consumers, it should have proposed an amendment Bill that is based on the dictum of supply-side management in which manufacturers, importers etc, are barred from producing appliances, equipment and services below a pre-defined level of energy efficiency.\u000a\u000aThere are many successful models of such supply-side management elsewhere in the world. For example, there is this Top Runners Programme in Japan in which the basis for the adoption of standards is pre-defined as the use-phase energy performance of the best technology available on the market. Exact standard levels, however, along with appropriate target years, are agreed on via an extensive consultative processes involving several stakeholder groups. Thereafter, when promulgated by the regulator, the targets become mandatory for all manufacturers and importers. In this manner, the industry will not only receive self-stimulus for continuous improvement but this will also help produce indigenous world leaders in technology.\u000a\u000aTo the contrary, the new Indian legislation is now all set to produce mediocres simply for the reason that the proposed Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) mechanism under the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency proposes to set standards based on the industrys average rather than the industrys best. In fact, there will be no real energy saving in the country because for the PAT mechanism to be successful, some industries will be performing better than the average to earn Energy Saving Certificates while others have to perform below the average to buy those certificates. Indias quest for becoming a global leader in manufacturing and industry would remain a dream for ever.\u000a\u000aThe legislation is not only anti-consumer but also anti-poor. There is nothing in the new legislation that can assure us that the energy saved by richer consumers and big industries would be preferentially used by small entrepreneurs and villagers for whom the marginal productivity of any additional electricity use is much higher compared to big industries and large consumers. These small entrepreneurs and poor villagers will continue to struggle for a flicker of light for even 2-3 hours a day.\u000a\u000aWhile the common man in the rural hinterland is happy riding alongside 100 people in a bus packed to its capacity, it is the wrong priority of the government that allows precious taxpayer money to be wasted in subsidising fuel for luxury cars carrying individuals in the metros. Add on the costs of roads, bridges, flyovers, expressways, all catering to the needs of a few individuals, while the overwhelming energy efficient majority in villages still await its turn.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the whole scheme of things fits well with the development design of the Planning Commission, which is finding peace in blaming the poor record of energy efficiency on farmers and even in arguing that subsidised electricity to these extravagant farmers must be stopped to enhance ground water level.\u000a\u000aBodies like the Planning Commission can afford to conveniently forget that poor farmers are only reducing their risk and securitising themselves against erratic power and canal water supply by putting up redundantly large irrigation pumps. The fair question is that, where does the subsidy of Rs 7,000 crore provided in the Budget (for the year 2010-11) of the ministry of power go Not to the aam aadmi!\u000a\u000aThe author, a Rajya Sabha MP, is a national spokesman for the BJP

a((VEfficiency and sustainability have become the twin mantras that gained currency in the aftermath of the economic slowdown. In this process, smart infrastructure is expected to play an important role. In India, infrastructure is an area of high-priority area for the government. And within infrastructure, Mission 2012: Power to Alla comprehensive blueprint that encompasses generation, transmission, distribution and conservationis an attempt by the government to ensure sufficient, reliable and quality power at optimum cost.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, what seems like an ambitious goal is well within reach through one of the most exciting and potent concepts of all timessmart grid. This state-of-the-art technology integrates an entire power grid system into a single, interactive real-time network to ensure improved performance and reliability while eliminating waste to reduce the environmental impact. In fact, smart grids optimise not just generation and distribution but also consumption. And with their ability to consolidate power from conventional and clean energy sources, they reduce CO2 emissions to the extent it's technically feasible.\u000a\u000aThe traditional power grid is based on centralised generation plants that supply consumers via long-established, unidirectional transmission & distribution (T&D) systems. In contrast, the smart grid is an advanced version, an intelligent system that not only delivers reliable supplies on demand but also receives power of all qualities from all sourcesboth centralised and distributed.\u000a\u000aFor instance, visualise a home where residents keep track of their energy spending. A smart meter helps run the washing machine during offpeak hours and the dishwasher, too, in order to make use of lower tariffs. Whats more, the house has solar panels and a mini-wind turbine installed on the roof. Therefore, instead of using energy from the grid, the residents can bank upon their own energy production, and even sell the extra energy to the grid. Though this concept sounds futuristic, experiments across the world show that it is possible and has become popular in the US, Germany, Spain and Italy, among other nations.\u000a\u000aWhat makes the smart grid special is the fact that it is environment-friendly. For instance, according to a research sponsored by the US government, improving the efficiency of the national electricity grid by 5% would be equivalent of eliminating the carbon emissions and fuel use of 53 million cars. This digital system of electricity distribution not only negates waste but also opens up the market for alternative energy producers of all sizes, by decentralising energy production.\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly, this is an exciting concept, and the world is latching on to it. US President Barack Obama last year passed an $11-billion stimulus package for smart grid technology and for expanding transmission to renewable rich areas. The 30% increase in funding was to kickstart the project that would also include smart meters. In Germany, the Meregio (minimum emission region) project has taken off for pilot deployment.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the whole world is waking up to the fact that it will be impossible to meet the increasing energy demands without investing in smart grids. According to a KPMG study, even in the current low-growth scenario, India would need to increase its installed capacity to at least 183 gw by 2012 from the existing 132 gw. The challenge is that Indias T&D losses are one of the highest in the world, averaging at 50% after taking power theft into account. Installing smart grid is the best way the country can rein in the losses and ramp up generation to meet the energy needs of its growing economy.\u000a\u000aThe Indian government has initiated the accelerated power development & reform programme (APDRP) in 2001. The programme aims to strengthen sub-T&D networks, thus reducing the aggregate technical & commercial (AT&C) losses. In 2008, the restructured APDRP or R-APDRP released the revised terms and conditions, with the focus on actual and demonstrable performance in terms of sustained loss reduction.\u000a\u000aTill date, 27 states have either notified or constituted their regulatory commissions with 100% feeder metering achieved in 20 states. In a first of its kind project in the world, the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (KPTCL) has attempted to strengthen its power networks and the constituent distribution utilities.\u000a\u000aWith a consumer base of almost 16 million and plans to add about 10,000 mw power in the next few years, KPTCLs T&D is multiplying every year. The integrated Scada solution will include monitoring 867 T&D stations with one million input/output points across Karnataka from a single control room in real time in Bangalore.\u000a\u000aThe project will help KPTCL manage distributed generation from independent power producers), non-conventional energy producers and mini hydel plants in the KPTCL grid. A significant step in the direction of making the grid smart, this project will also help reduce line losses, voltage irregularities and energy billing.\u000a\u000aThe world over, the clamour today is for renewable energy sources that are also cost-efficient. A smart grid is the right way forward for India as well. Being a new concept, research and implementation is taking place at almost the same breath. In this context, countries like India and China, which need to increase their power supply exponentially each year, can set examples using smart grid, especially for newer networks.\u000a\u000aHowsoever we try, there are no short cuts to reach the dual targets of meeting energy needs while staying green. Plugging the leakages and maximising efficiencies will be the answer for a long time. In all probability, turning smart has never been more advantageous than now.\u000a\u000aThe author is the head of power systems division at ABB India

a((VPUNE: With an objective of making available easier grid connectivity to hydro electric power stations and other generating stations, based on renewable sources of energy, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ( CERC ) has liberalised grid access for such projects.While the threshold capacity (the minimum quantum of power needed) for connecting to inter-state grid will be 250 MW for thermal power stations, the threshold has been reduced to 50 MW for hydro electric generating stations and other generating stations using renewable sources of energy, a statement issued by CERC on Tuesday said.Another important regulatory change has been made to permit connectivity of inter-state grid to such hydro generating stations and renewable energy source based stations which have individually installed capacity of less than 50 MW, but approach the Central Transmission Utility (Powergrid) collectively with an aggregate installed capacity of 50 MW and above."For example, two hydro generating stations having a capacity of 30 MW and 20 MW can collectively seek connectivity with inter-state grid at a single connection point if they mutually agree to undertake operational and commercial responsibilities through a lead generator, which can be one of these two generating stations," the statement explained.These changes have been made by CERC in view of the feedback received that state transmission utilities in many stations, particularly in north-eastern states, were not in a position to extend connectivity to their systems and this difficulty was hindering the development of hydro electric stations and renewable source based stations.To implement the above decisions, CERC has amended its grant of grid connectivity regulations. The amendment has been notified and is available on CERC website www.cercind.gov.inCity-based Prayas energy group has welcomed the move. Ranjit Deshmukh, member, Prayas, said, "It will facilitate connection of relatively a very large number of renewable energy plants and renewable energy contracts leading to larger market competition. State power utilities will be able to buy renewable energy from other resources to fulfil their obligations of purchasing a certain quantum of renewable energy," he remarked.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe results of a new research reveal how the savanna terrain of Africa has evolved and show how termite mounds can be used to predict ecological shifts from climate change. The research is published online in Nature Communications.\u000a\u000aUsing sophisticated airborne imaging and structural analysis, scientists at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology mapped more than 40,000 termite mounds over 192 square miles in the African savanna. They found that their size and distribution is linked to vegetation and landscape patterns associated with annual rainfall.\u000a\u000aMound-building termites in the study area of Kruger National Park in South Africa tend to build their nests in areas that are not too wet, nor too dry, but are well drained, and on slopes of savanna hills above boundaries called seeplines.\u000a\u000aSeeplines form where water has flowed below ground through sandy, porous soil and backs up at areas rich in clay. Typically woody trees prefer the well-drained upslope side where the mounds tend to locate, while grasses dominate the wetter areas down slope, according to a Carnegie Institution press release.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese relationships make the termite mounds excellent indicators of the geology, hydrology, and soil conditions,\u201d commented lead author Shaun Levick at Carnegie. \u201cWe looked at the mound density, size, and location on the hills with respect to the vegetation patterns.\u201d\u000a\u000aResearch into the ecology of these savannas has focused on the patterns of woody trees and shorter vegetation over larger, regional scales.\u000a\u000aThe research was conducted by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) which can penetrate the canopy all the way to the soil level and probe about 40,000 acres per day.\u000a\u000aExplained Levick: \u201cWe found that precipitation, along with elevation, hydrological, and soil conditions determine whether the area will be dominated by grasses or woody vegetation and the size and density of termite mounds.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe advantage of monitoring termite mounds in addition to vegetation is that mounds are so tightly coupled with soil and hydrological conditions that they make it easier to map the hill slope seeplines. Furthermore, vegetation cover varies a lot between wet and dry season, while the mounds are not subject to these fluctuations.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy understanding the patterns of the vegetation and termite mounds over different moisture zones, we can project how the landscape might change with climate change,\u201d explained co-author Greg Asner at Carnegie.

But humans are also cooling the planet to some degree, by releasing air-polluting particles that lower temperatures by reflecting the sun\u2019s energy back into space.\u000a\u000aMr. Puma and his co-author, Benjamin Cook found that irrigation-linked cooling grew noticeably in the 1950s as irrigation rates exploded, and that more rain is now falling downstream of these heavily watered regions.\u000a\u000aIn warm, dry regions, irrigation increases the amount of water available for plants to release into the air through a process called evapotranspiration. When the soil is wet, part of the sun\u2019s energy is diverted from warming the soil to vaporizing its moisture, creating a cooling effect.\u000a\u000aThe study suggests that irrigation may be altering the pattern of the Asian monsoon, the rains that feed nearly half of the world\u2019s population.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe study points to the importance of including irrigation in regional and global climate models so that we can anticipate precipitation and temperature impacts, and better manage our land, water and food in stressed environments,\u201d Mr. Lall said.\u000a\u000aThe study is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIt is a sign of the times that the political battle in Australia began over climate change and was settled in favour of the side with the more advanced Internet vision. Labour's failure, under the leadership of Kevin Rudd, to implement a promised carbon emissions trading scheme led to a dramatic fall in the party's ratings. It also triggered an internal rebellion that catapulted Julia Gillard to the office of Prime Minister earlier this year. Ms Gillard called the August 21 snap election to legitimise the coup. But in a massive setback to her, it produced a hung Parliament, the first in 70 years, with Labour and the Coalition deadlocked with 72 seats each in the 150-seat House of Representatives. With the lone Greens member, the first ever in the lower house, and an independent announcing their support for Labour early on, the focus was on a group of three conservative independents. After 17 days of negotiations with both sides, two members of the trio decided to go with Labour, citing its campaign promise of a high-speed optical fibre national broadband network. That two issues that do not carry the here-and-now urgency \u2014 of the kind voters usually look for in an election manifesto \u2014 should have played such a big part in the Australian political drama is illustrative of the expanding agenda of modern democratic process. Still there's no getting away from the numbers in Parliament: Labour's wafer-thin majority, pieced together with politicians from the right and the left, signals plenty of difficulties ahead for Prime Minister Gillard.\u000a\u000aThe Greens have given their support on condition that the government will set a price on carbon emissions, a more ambitious scheme than Labour's emissions trading proposal. They support Labour's plan for a tax on the profits of mining companies but an independent supporter of the government has indicated he opposes the tax. With just two seats behind the ruling party and sore at losing the race for government formation, the Coalition \u2014 comprising the Liberal and National parties \u2014 has made clear its intention to underline the split mandate by acting as a \u201ccredible alternative government.\u201d The Coalition is sceptical about climate change science and it opposes the mining tax. The government's immigration policy \u2014 the Prime Minister has opportunistically indicated she favours tightening of the rules \u2014 may prove to be another flashpoint. Given the delicate political balance, international affairs may have to take a back seat, at least for the immediate future. All in all, this seems to be a good time to be in the opposition rather than in government.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aA University of Calgary climate scientist has said that there may be better ways to engineer the planet?s climate to prevent dangerous global warming than mimicking volcanoes.\u000a\u000a?Releasing engineered nano-sized disks, or sulphuric acid in a condensable vapour above the Earth, are two novel approaches. These approaches offer advantages over simply putting sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere,? says David Keith, a director in the Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy and a Schulich School of Engineering professor.\u000a\u000aMr. Keith, a global leader in investigating this topic, says that geo-engineering, or engineering the climate on a global scale, is an imperfect science.\u000a\u000a?It cannot offset the risks that come from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If we don?t halt man-made CO2 emissions, no amount of climate engineering can eliminate the problems - massive emissions reductions are still necessary,? he added.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Mr. Keith believes that research on geo-engineering technologies, their effectiveness and environmental impacts needs to be expanded. ?I think the stakes are simply too high at this point to think that ignorance is a good policy,? he added.\u000a\u000aMr. Keith suggests two novel geo-engineering approaches-?levitating? engineered nano-particles, and the airborne release of sulphuric acid-in two newly published studies. One of study was authored by Mr. Keith alone, and the other with scientists in Canada, the U.S. and Switzerland.\u000a\u000aScientists investigating geo-engineering have so far looked mainly at injecting sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThis approach imitates the way volcanoes create sulphuric acid aerosols, or sulphates, that will reflect solar radiation back into space - thereby cooling the planet?s surface.\u000a\u000aMr. Keith says that sulphates are blunt instruments for climate engineering. It?s very difficult to achieve the optimum distribution and size of the aerosols in the atmosphere to reflect the most solar radiation and get the maximum cooling benefit.\u000a\u000a?A downside of both these new ideas is they would do something that nature has never seen before. It?s easier to think of new ideas than to understand their effectiveness and environmental risks,? said Keith.\u000a\u000aIn his first study, Keith describes a new class of engineered nano-particles that might be used to offset global warming more efficiently, and with fewer negative side effects, than using sulphates. According to Mr. Keith, the distribution of engineered nano?particles above the Earth could be more controlled and less likely to harm the planet?s protective ozone layer.\u000a\u000aIn a separate new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Mr. Keith and international scientists describe another geo-engineering approach that may also offer advantages over injecting sulphur dioxide gas. Releasing sulphuric acid, or another condensable vapour, from an aircraft would give better control of particle size. The study says this would reflect more solar radiation back into space, while using fewer particles overall and reducing unwanted heating in the lower stratosphere.\u000a\u000aThe study included computer modelling that showed that the sulphuric acid would quickly condense in a plume, forming smaller particles that would last longer in the stratosphere and be more effective in reflecting solar radiation than the large sulphates formed from sulphur dioxide gas.

So that every country will have trust that their interests are being represented in the small groups,\u201d she told a small group of journalists here.\u000a\u000aHer comments came against the backdrop of accusations by developing countries particularly smaller ones that Copenhagen talks were \u201chijacked\u201d by the host government, Denmark, whose prime minister convened a meeting of only 26 leaders in the last two days of the conference against the UN mandate.\u000a\u000aFigueres, who was on a day\u2019s visit to India ahead of the major climate change meet at Cancun in Mexico in November-December, however assured that everybody is heard at Cancun.\u000a\u000aShe also welcomed presence of several groups of nations such as G-77 comprising major developing nations set up to take up their cause at the global climate meet.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt (so many fragmented groups) makes harder (for negotiations) but it makes also more democratic as they will have their voice heard. Every single country is hard hit by the climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aNoting that the process was one of the major problems in Copenhagen where many participants were left out, she said, \u201cthe Secretariat (UN) is working very closely with the Mexican government to form a team with it which would be taking on the political leadership role during negotiations at Cancun.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have looked at Copenhagen and we have identified several concrete ways by which the process can be improved, electronic registration system being one of them,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aOn her appointment as the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate head in July, Figueres who hails from Costa Rica said, \u201cIt is no co-incidence that the Secretary General (Ban Ki Moon) chose a person of the developing world to head the Secretariat...\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I think that is very much a reflection of the recognition of the increasing important role that the developing countries have in the climate change negotiations,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe appointment of the Costa Rican negotiator as the executive secretary of the UNFCCC has been widely welcomed, particularly among developing countries which hope she will increase pressure on industrialised countries to deliver deeper cuts in carbon emissions.

Pachauri, Director-General, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), here on Thursday.\u000a\u000aLaying the foundation stone for a science and technology park at MARG site near Marakkanam on East Coast Road, Dr. Pachauri, also Chairman, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the study would look into various ocean current patterns in the area and it would be completed by the middle of next year.\u000a\u000aAnswering a question on the negative impact of setting up a neutrino laboratory in forest areas in Theni district, Dr. Pachauri said he was not aware of the project. However, he was of the opinion that one should not think that sophisticated science would not be directly useful to mankind.\u000a\u000aThe Centre, sometime ago, introduced a new certification system for different types of buildings in the country, known as Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA). It comprised 34 criteria categorised under various sections such as site selection, planning, conservation and efficient utilisation of resources, building operation and maintenance and innovation points. Eight of these were mandatory, four partly mandatory and the rest, optional. Each criterion had points assigned to it.\u000a\u000aThe Pune Municipal Corporation had agreed to implement the system in its jurisdiction and the Central Public Works Department was introducing the concept in its buildings. The indigenously prepared GRIHA system was better than the existing LEEDS Certification System.\u000a\u000aA change will come in the bio-sciences field after a breakthrough within a matter of time, he said.\u000a\u000aGRK Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director, MARG Group, said a total of 1.3 million sqft area would be the built-up area at the project site.\u000a\u000aThe per square foot cost would range between Rs.2,200 to Rs.2,800.

a((VThe Planning Commission, in a report to the Prime Minister, has sought to a change in the Gadgil Mukerjee formula for allocation of resources to state governments.\u000a\u000aThis comes days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed concern over environment degradation. Only two states meet river water quality norms and six comply with overall air quality norms. Half the states do not have adequate facilities to treat waste.\u000a\u000a\u201cConsidering the influence of natural resources depletion and unabated pollution in many sectors of the economy, it is considered necessary to evolve environment performance by states as a criteria for allocation of resources,\u201d the commission said in a note to Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\u000a\u000aUnder the Gadgil Mukerjee formula, the maximum weightage (60 per cent) is given to population of the state followed by per capita income (25 per cent) whereas environmental performance is not even considered.\u000a\u000aThe panel has recommended water pollution, air quality, waste management, forest management and climate change as five sectors for reviving environment performance of states. \u201cBased on the performance, the states will get additional funds,\u201d a commission official said.\u000a\u000aSingh at a recent meeting with editors had expressed concern over environment degradation and sought a balance between economic growth and saving the environment.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are looking at ways to foster economic growth by minimising impact on the environment,\u201d commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.\u000a\u000aOne such initiative is a paper on managing water depleting resources in the country.

a((VCanada hosted this years G-20 and as a follow-up it had a conference for Speakers of Second Chambersor of unicameral ones where relevantfrom September 2-5. The theme was Food Security and Financial Crisis.\u000a\u000aThe burden of the speeches was predictable. Food security for most people is about agriculture and its protection. It is about food production and everyone wished they could grow more food. Others took a neo-Malthusian line that the problem was too many people. Others urged a simpler lifestyle. China spoke of its aid for African countries to help them grow more food and reminded the world that its own foodgrain output exceeded 500 million tonnes. Saudi Arabia complained about speculation in commodity markets that caused spikes in food prices in 2007 and 2008.\u000a\u000aOne can see why this is appealing but may not be the answer. There is a lot of sentimentality about land and why peasants must never be made to sell land on which food can be grown. But the countries where there is greatest food security are not those with a lot of people engaged in agriculture but often where they are a small percentage of the population. This is because what matters is productivity per acre and per person. The smart country invests in raising productivity in agriculture, removes surplus people from agriculture and finds them productive work, which helps them buy the food they need.\u000a\u000aFood security also needs to be seen in the context of climate change, which did not get much mention at the G-20 Meeting. The world community is still sleepwalking through climate change challenges. The mistake, in my view, was to emphasise global warming in terms of mean temperature. What really matters is the impact on soil and sea level differentially across the world. This, as well as the volatility of climate, will severely affect the capacity of the world to produce food.\u000a\u000aRising sea levels will pose the biggest problem since low-lying areas such as the Maldives, parts of Bangladesh and many sea-side areas in India will sink. The need for finding host countries that can receive the masses of people displaced by rising sea levels is a global issue that has not been confronted. There are countries that are virtually empty while others are overpopulated. But immigration has become a dirty word everywhere and it is not even on the agenda of G-20. Australias population does not exceed that of Mumbai and Canadas is not more than Mumbai plus Kolkata. This is not to say they should throw open their doors, but someone needs to take a global view of the coming catastrophe. It will affect food production and the demand for food.\u000a\u000aOne recent trend that is a substitute for people movement is the leasing of large tracts of land in countries that are land surplus by countries that know a lot about intensive food cultivation. Although this is immediately denounced as land grab or neo-colonialism, it is a welcome way to increase food output by making idle land or land where cultivation is extensive rather than intensive, more productive of foodgrains. The host country, of course, needs to charge the appropriate price for the land leased. But it is a win-win situation, as the World Bank seems to have recognised recently.\u000a\u000aThere will also be desertification and warming of colder climates. This will change the geography of food supply over the next 25 years. But apart from British joy at being able to grow good dry white wine in Kent, we do not see much understanding of what might be the consequence. This may make surplus food grain producers deficit countries or increase the demand for water in the drying regions to a great extent. Water wars are being forecast, although one must hope that with some forethought they can be avoided.\u000a\u000aIndia is about to embark on food security on massive scale but in Indias case what we mean by food security is not macro food security but food entitlements to the section considered below poverty line (BPL). There seems to be a Dutch Auction as to how many BPL families there are28.5% (NSS), 37.5% (Tendulkar), 50% (rural development ministry) or 77% (Arjun Sengupta). It seems a perverse race in which the more poor you find the closer you are to the powers that be in the Congress. (Is it a matter of pride for the Congress that even after 63 years of Independence in which the Congress ruled for all but 20 years, BPL numbers are so high)\u000a\u000aThe real trouble is not just that money and food will be wasted in these schemes but that India seems to be taken for granted that supply of foodgrains is guaranteed. That may yet prove a fatal mistake.\u000a\u000aThe author is a prominent economist and Labour peer

This clubbing will make projects more viable.\u000a\u000aAs are planning to make it compulsory for distribution to buy 0.25 per cent of their power needs from this year, either in physical form or in renewable energy certificate, the business looks quite lucrative.\u000a\u000aA senior official at the said for off-grid allocation of 100 Mw across the country, there was an unprecedented response and all applications were closed within an hour.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, the power trading wing of NTPC, Vyapar Vidyut Nigam (NVVN), has invited expression of interests for 650 Mw of for completing the Phase-I operation for bringing 1,000 Mw by 2013,\u201d he said. The last date for submitting expression of interests for this is September 17.\u000a\u000aThe official said considering high capital cost and per unit rate, the government had roped in NVVN to buy this power at a rate, Rs 17.51 for PV Modules and Rs 15.31 for Concentrated Solar Power, fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The Centre plans to build solar capacity of 20,000 Mw by 2020.\u000a\u000aMumbai-based power analyst D Radhakrishna told Business Standard that one of the main barriers to solar energy was the rate. The project cost of a solar plant is around Rs 18 crore per Mw, against Rs 5 crore for a conventional power plant, thus making the rate component almost four times.\u000a\u000aThe average generation rate is around Rs 3.50 and thus, the solar rate becomes around Rs 16. The second barrier is plant utilisation factor, with Sun shining only eight to 10 hours for 250 days a year, making plant utilisation factor around 25 per cent.\u000a\u000aThe topography of Solar India is that only a few states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra and few parts of Central India have good solar potential. Despite these odds, the official said, the response was good, as most developers, who have got land and grid connectivity arrangements, were in queue for making good fortune.\u000a\u000aNVVN official said the had given the consent that a mechanism would be developed by the ministries of power, new and renewable energy, and NVVN, so that any revenue loss to NVVN would be provided by the

a((VA parliamentary panel finds \u2018glaring disparity\u2019 between targets set and achieved for the 11th Plan period.\u000a\u000aWhile the government is pushing for the use of renewable energy in rural areas to address the twin problems of climate change and scarcity of power, the for carrying out the exercise has not been performing well. In a major indictment of its lacklustre performance, a parliamentary panel has pulled up the (MNRE) for failing to meet project targets and stop disparities in utilisation of funds in its rural renewable energy programmes.\u000a\u000aThe panel has pointed out that its examination has revealed \u201cglaring disparity\u201d between the targets set and achieved under different programmes on rural renewable energy being run by MNRE. These programmes include (RVE), Village Energy Security (VESP), solar power and hydro projects scheme.\u000a\u000aMNRE had proposed a plan outlay of Rs 2,500 crore for its rural energy schemes for the current Plan period including Rs 650 crore for RVE, Rs 900 crore for non-electrical RE systems and Rs 250 crore for biogas scheme. However, Rs 1,000 crore outlay was approved. The ministry has managed to electrify only 2,300 villages out of the targeted 5,000 since March 2007, with an expenditure of Rs 272 crore \u2014 90 per cent of the budget estimate of Rs 303 crore.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnder RVE, even 50 per cent of the villages earmarked under the target for first three years of the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007-12) have not been electrified and budget allocation of about 90 per cent has been eaten up. Under biogas, only 250,000 plants have been established while the expenditure on the same has overshot the budgetary estimate,\u201d the standing committee on energy has stated in its report on \u201cRenewable Energy for Rural Applications\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLAGGING PACE * MNRE has managed to electrify only 2,300 villages of the targeted 5,000 since March 2007 * The ministry has set up only 534 Mw of small hydro power capacity against the targeted 1,400 Mw for the current Plan period * Under Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, while the government has so far awarded 573 projects worth over '31,700 crore, more than 30 per cent of the target area remains unelectrified * In the VESP scheme, only test projects have been commissioned so far, while the original proposal was to cover 1,000 villages\u000a\u000aThe ministry has also received flak from the parliamentary committee for setting up only 534 Mw of small hydro power capacity against the targeted 1,400 Mw for the current Plan period. It noted that this target had been reduced to 1,000 Mw during mid-term appraisal without reducing the financial allocation of Rs 700 crore.\u000a\u000aThe report adds that the sidelining of important programmes by not initiating any action regarding their implementation itself speaks about the poor and improper planning and mixing up of the priority areas. \u201cDespite this, there has been a 45 per cent increase in the budgetary allocation of the ministry for rural renewable energy programmes during the mid-term appraisal,\u201d the report, tabled in Parliament recently, adds.\u000a\u000aNoting the prevailing \u201cextreme incoherence in overall expenditure\u201d, the panel has warned the government of ill-effects. \u201cWith this attitude, it will be practically impossible to do something meaningful within the stipulated timeframe.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the power ministry looks after the overall nationwide rural electrification programme through its flagship (RGGVY), MNRE looks after the implementation of schemes like RVE in rural areas. MNRE cites lack of coordination between the implementing agencies of RGGVY and RVE as one of the constraints for meeting targets. The panel has, however, disagreed and called the obstacles highlighted by the ministry as \u201cneither unforeseen nor insurmountable\u201d. The RVE programme of MNRE was planned to provide power to those villages which are not covered under the RGGVY scheme through small hydro, biogas and solar plants.\u000a\u000aRGGVY is one of the six schemes under the UPA government\u2019s flagship (BNP) aimed at strengthening the rural power distribution backbone through installing sub-stations and transformers and setting up small-sized power generation plants.\u000a\u000aUnder RGGVY, while the government has so far awarded 573 projects worth over Rs 31,700 crore, more than 35,000 villages in the country \u2014 30 per cent of the target for the current Plan period \u2014 remain without electricity. \u201cThe challenge is that the and MNRE will have to combine their efforts to get that last mile connectivity for far-flung villages. The difficult terrain in such areas is a major challenge for the government which can be addressed by distributed generation plants,\u201d said Gokul Chaudhri, Partner, BMR Advisors.\u000a\u000aMNRE states lack of approvals by the state governments as a major reason for its poor performance. \u201cWe have pointed out that the state governments have not paid adequate attention to the implementation of the scheme,\u201d MNRE Secretary Deepak Gupta said in his reply to the committee.\u000a\u000aThe panel has expressed \u201csurprise\u201d over the fact that even in the VESP scheme, only test projects have been commissioned so far by the ministry while the original proposal was to cover 1,000 villages with a total outlay of Rs 225 crore during the current Plan period.\u000a\u000aThe panel has accused the ministry of poor performance and tardy implementation of projects. \u201cMoreover, the reasons advanced by the ministry for this state of affairs are superficial and not convincing. It appears that the problems enumerated by the ministry are meant to cover up their own failure in foreseeing the difficulty in remote areas and coming up with pragmatic remedial measures,\u201d it said.

The Jai Malhar Village Watershed Committee was one of the recipients for the JSW-The Times of India Earth Care Awards 2010. Bhimabhai Hande said, "Our watershed is now managed by the community. We ensure not a drop goes waste."Recognising efforts like these by communities, corporate entities and NGOs, a gala function was organised in the capital on Friday to award winners of the second JSW-The Times of India Earth Care Awards. MoS for IT and communications Sachin Pilot was the chief guest.In his inaugural speech, Vineet Jain, Times Group Managing Director, pointed out that "a decade ago only a small group of scientists and a smaller group of policymakers were aware of the threats from climate change". He said in the ensuing 10 years, the concerns of environment and climate change had got mainstreamed with the issues, "forcing them into public perception". He also waded into the development versus environment debate: "A rapidly-growing economy such as ours faces a big dilemma: Development versus environment. Capping carbon emission could slow down growth. And growth is the only way out of poverty. The challenge is to look beyond mutually exclusive, zero-sum scenarios. Can we find win-win paths to growth? I believe we need to hasten the development of clean technologies, and embrace eco-friendly alternatives. We need attractive incentives in the form of tax breaks, lower tariffs and R&D grants to persuade industry to go green. And we need to punish those who violate energy-efficiency solutions.""Even as world leaders try to work towards a climate treaty, we at the Times... have chosen to use the most potent weapon at our disposal \u2014 to create public awareness about climate change, and to share knowledge of best practices both within and outside the country.To those who think the human race can carry on with its old and unsustainable ways of living and doing business, I can only say, time is not a luxury we have. This is one decision we cannot postpone," he added.Sangeeta Jindal, head of Jindal Foundation, talked of the challenges posed by climate change along with the hope raised by this year's awardees. She said the task of the jury, that included IPCC chief R K Pachauri, agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan and Kartikeya Sarabhai of Centre for Environment Education, was much harder since there were more than 50 applicants in the fray.Pachauri recollected policy-making in the 1980s when environment was still a fringe issue, and stressed that the corporate sector must spearhead the search for solutions to climate change.A panel of four eminent experts \u2014 Chandra Bhushan, deputy director of Centre for Science and Environment, S Parasuraman, director of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Shailaja Chandra,former chief secretary of Delhi, and C L L Gowda of ICRISAT \u2014 highlighted the climate change challenges and the way forward.

a((VMembers of a United Nations (UN) panel have asked for a thorough review of several projects that come under a scheme that compensates companies in the developing world for adopting clean technology, following studies that show the scheme might be corrupt. The demand for review comes from several members of the panel, despite protests from the Indian side.\u000a\u000aThe controversy surrounds projects that remove HFC 23, one of the most potent greenhouse gases in existence, from the atmosphere. These projects make up less than 1 per cent of scheme projects but are responsible for more half the carbon credits awarded by the UN so far, mostly to chemical plants in India and China that emit HFC 23 as a byproduct.\u000a\u000aThere is \u201coverwhelming evidence that manufacturers are gaming the system and undermining carbon markets by producing more potent greenhouse gases just so they can get paid to destroy them,\u201d climate researcher Eva Filzmoser wrote in a recent report placed before a UN committee.\u000a\u000aSeveral members of the UN\u2019s Executive Board in charge of the scheme, called the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), called for a review of the projects, five of which are based in India, despite objections from the Indian member of the Board.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe suspension or \u2018putting on hold\u2019 of this Methodology would have not served any purpose as no new project is likely to come,\u201d Indian board member Rajesh Sethi told HT in a note. \u201cAll methodologies are reviewed in a time sequence and this methodology would also be reviewed in its turn.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the nonprofit groups Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and CDM Watch say their data are compelling.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur analysis showed that three [Indian] projects all produced each year exactly the amount of [gas] eligible for crediting,\u201d Clare Perry, a senior campaigner with EIA, told HT.\u000a\u000aThe Indian companies are authorized to receive more than 10 million carbon credits every year, worth about Rs. 1135 crore, for burning the chemical byproduct HFC 23 instead of emitting it into the atmosphere. The UN\u2019s review is likely to delay the award of these credits, many of which are already contracted to buyers in the United States, Europe and Japan.\u000a\u000aWhen contacted by HT, company spokesmen declined to speak individually but referred to the Refrigerant Gas Manufacturers Association, an industry conglomerate.\u000a\u000aAccording to a statement by the group, the NGOs\u2019 reports are \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d and \u201cit is unfair to tarnish the reputation of an entire industry, many of whose members are listed entities with high standards of corporate governance and ethics, of having manipulated the CDM.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe contracts are some of the most lucrative climate finance projects in the world. A company pays less than Re. 100 to dispose of a tonne of HFC 23, a chemical byproduct, but earns as much as Rs. 1.8 crore from the UN for doing so.\u000a\u000aIn the 2009-2010 financial year, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd, which runs India\u2019s oldest CDM project for removal of HFC 23, made Rs. 47,295 lakhs from the sale of carbon credits, nearly half of the company\u2019s revenue for that year, according to public documents. The youngest project, by Hindustan Fluorocarbons Ltd, has yet to make money from CDM but is counting on that income to cover loans, according to public documents.\u000a\u000aIf there are extensive delays in the system, the market might have grounds to legally challenge the UN, said Alessandro Vitelli, director of strategy and information at the carbon consultancy firm IDEAcarbon.\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation all round.\u201d\u000a\u000aA scientific study recently found that world emissions of HFC 23 had come down by about 40 per cent between 2006 and 2009.

The Rs 600-crore project was unable to make any headway due to the delay in submission of the DPR by the company.\u000a\u000a"We have asked to submit DPR for the project if it is really serious in executing the project else the state government can consider an alternative proposal from some other developer,\u201d a highly placed official source told Business Standard.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the state government is in the process of conducting field studies for identification of suitable locations in the state where plants can be installed. This study is likely to be completed within two years.\u000a\u000aBesides, the proposals for eight solar power projects in the state, each with a capacity of 1 MW are likely to be approved soon by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) of the Government of India. The total cost of setting up of these wight solar power projects is Rs 144 crore.\u000a\u000a"These eight solar power projects are among the 100-odd projects being shortlisted by the IREDA. The developers of these projects have already submitted all the relevant documents, including the bank guarantee and are likely to be approved soon\u201d, said a source at Orissa Renewable Energy Development Agency (OREDA).\u000a\u000aWork on these eight solar power projects is set to start by December this year and the projects are expected to be commissioned by June 2011.\u000a\u000aThese solar power projects were to come up at Sundergarh, Sambalpur, Deogarh, Sonepur, Bolangir, Nayagarh, Khurda and Cuttack. These projects are to be connected to the 33 KV grid or below.\u000a\u000aThe developers, who would be setting up these projects, are Mumbai-based Pan Time Finance Company which is setting up the solar plant at Benta village in Nayagarh district; Rourkela-based Jay Iron & Steel Company at Haripada in Sambalpur district; Kolkata-based Abacus Holdings Limited at Ainlachhat village in Sonepur district; Kalunga-based Mahavir Ferro Alloys Limited at Tankajodi village in Sundergarh district; Bhubaneswar-based MGM Minerals at Patrapada in Khurda district; Bhubaneswar-based Molisati Vinmay Pvt Ltd at Ranja in Deogarh district; Hyderabad-based Raajratna Energy Holdings at Sadeipali in Bolangir district and Barbil-based S N Mohanty Ltd at Patapur in Cuttack district.

a((VNEW DELHI: Aparna Doshi , chief operating officer of Astonfield Renewable Resources, has been named Co-chair of the US-India Business Council (USIBC) Solar Power Task Force, a major new initiative to promote US-India trade and investment in the burgeoning solar power sector.As the subcommittee of USIBC's Energy, Environment, Enterprise (EEE) Executive Committee, comprised of more than 100 members, the USIBC Solar Task Force will be pivotal in the development of clean energy in India and beyond. Doshi's expertise in both solar power business development and policy setting in India will make her leadership to the committee's work invaluable.The establishment of the task force is an important milestone in US-India collaboration and comes at a very opportune time, just prior to the upcoming November visit of US President, Barack Obama, to India.The Government of India is seeking to become a solar power generating hub and leader in solar services and equipment in the coming years.As a strong supporter of the development of renewable energy, President Obama's visit should help to foster strategic relationships between the two countries on important global issues, including the topic of renewable energy. To that end, USIBC's Solar Power Task Force will play a significant role in supporting policy formulation leading to the success of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) to provide clean energy to sustain India's double digit growth.The aim of the USIBC Solar Task Force is to stimulate the exchange of regulatory and policy best practices with the government of India and respective states, which should enable the development of commercially viable solar power plants while allowing India to grow into one of the largest solar power markets in the world.Leading solar technologies and implementation practices will also be more readily exchanged through the task force. Further, by facilitating the financing of solar power products and solar equipment manufacturing in India, technology costs will no longer be a major challenge. Additionally, the task force will support the JNNSM by addressing risks and remove difficulties to bringing about the rapid, competitive implementation of effective policies for growth in the Indian solar sector."I sincerely believe that India will become the world leader in solar power generation and manufacturing, and I am honored to have been asked to provide leadership to this ambitious project. The USIBC Solar Task Force will be a powerful influence in the US and Indian solar sectors and I am excited to work to make renewable energy the norm in our two countries," said Aparna Doshi.Doshi oversees the corporate and operations strategy of Astonfield. She works with the leadership team in implementing Astonfield's strategy and with the technical partners and the finance and operations team to ensure seamless execution of the company's portfolio.Astonfield has taken a leadership position in bringing affordable clean energy to emerging markets like India through strategic technology partners and increased foreign investments. Being an integral part in the formation of this taskforce is a testament to this fact.

Output in north Indias tea plantations is likely to be lower by 20 million kg because of heliopeltis disease attack on tea crop and adverse weather conditions, Maheshwari said on the sidelines of a two-day planters conference here Monday.\u000a\u000aBut production in south Indian plantations would be higher by 5 million kg by the end of December.\u000a\u000aPrices in north India have been ruling high because of the output shortage while they have been down in south India.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, average tea prices are likely to be firm and may move up above last years levels, Maheshwari said. Supply tightness is expected to slowly rise as output is slowing in both large and small gardens, he said.\u000a\u000aIn the last 10 years, organised tea gardens lost 50 million kg of tea while small growers output rose. Now their output is also slowing, Maheshwari said.\u000a\u000aHe expects tea shortage to be around 100 million kg at the close of the season.\u000a\u000aTea futures after 2012\u000a\u000aTea Board wants to introduce tea futures and will soon initiate the process to bring this about, Roshni Sen, deputy chairman of the board, said Monday. The aim is to launch tea futures during the 12th Plan (2012-17), Sen said. If we launch futures we will go foolproof. Thats why we are taking time, Sen said.\u000a\u000aEmission policy must include plantation sector, says official\u000a\u000aInclusion of interests of the plantation sector in cap and trade negotiations is necessary to explore the sectors carbon credit potential, a government official said Monday.\u000a\u000aCap and trade policy, or emission trading policy, is a market-based approach to control pollution by offering economic incentives. The plantation sector should endeavour to include its interest in the negotiations, said James Jacob, director of Rubber Research Institute of India.\u000a\u000aIn India, interests of plantation sector are not included in the emission trading policy as the sector comes under commerce ministry. The nodal ministry for climate change negotiations is ministry of environment and forests.\u000a\u000aIn carbon trading under Clean Development Mechanism, afforestation and reforestation credits have the least priority. Also, there are no buyers for afforestation and reforestation credits. Clean Development Mechanism is one of the mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol to help prevent harmful climate changes and achieve compliance on emission limits. Weather conditions have been changing in traditional plantation tracts of India over the past few years.\u000a\u000aThe most significant manifestations of climate change are warmer temperatures and changing pattern of rainfall, Jacob said in his paper Climate Change and Plantation Crops. Availability of natural rubber could be affected due to these changes, he said.\u000a\u000aAnnual mean maximum temperature has risen by 0.5 degree Celsius per decade, Jacob said citing data collected since 1956 at the meteorological station at Kottayam in Kerala. Such increases in temperatures could affect rubber yield, he said.

a((VThe Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary describes the ozone layer as a layer of air high above the Earth, which contains a lot of ozone, and which prevents harmful ultraviolet light from the sun from reaching the Earth.\u000a\u000aWhen an actual \u201cozone hole\u201d was discovered over the Antarctic in the early 1980s, it was realised that stricter measures had to be taken to protect the layer.\u000a\u000aIn 1987, an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol was drawn between 180 nations to stop making and using gases that deplete the ozone. For the past 10 years September 16 has been celebrated as the International Day or the Ozone Day. Nations came together for the preservation of the Ozone Layer as proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly on December 19, 1994. The focus was on the depletion of the ozone layer.\u000a\u000aProtective cover\u000a\u000aThe ozone in the atmosphere protects the earth from the sun's powerful ultraviolet radiation. This blanket of protection is called the ozone layer. But there are elements that are breaking the protective ozone layer. Scientists discovered that chemical compounds called CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), that are in aerosol sprays and refrigerants, were actually destroying the ozone faster than it could be replaced.\u000a\u000aThe oxygen molecules in the air that we breathe are two oxygen atoms fused together. But in the stratosphere, there are molecules of ozone, which are three oxygen atoms bound together. This layer of ozone filters out a lot of the sun's UV-B rays, which are harmful to life on earth.\u000a\u000aSome UV-B light that reaches us is helpful in converting cholesterol to Vitamin D in our skin. But too much can cause suntans and sunburns.\u000a\u000aIf the ozone layer gets depleted, too many UV-B rays will reach the earth's surface, causing health problems for animals (like skin cancer) and harming plant life.\u000a\u000aWhen ozone forms on the ground, it is harmful to people, crops, and trees. The ozone that forms on the ground when exhaust from cars, factories, and chemicals mix with strong sunlight and hot temperatures, creates smog. This can cause serious breathing problems.\u000a\u000aThe effects of ozone depletion can also cause a greenhouse effect, gradually warming the earth to the point where our polar ice caps melt and flood the coastal cities.\u000a\u000aBut all is not lost, the scientists feel, with the help and support of the people and stringent measures to protect the ozone layer, they can win the battle, say in 50 years time. Protect Earth by protecting the ozone layer, for it is our world, the only home we have.\u000a\u000aDo your bit\u000a\u000aPlant more trees as they can absorb carbon-di-oxide.\u000a\u000aSave energy.\u000a\u000aUse eco-friendly products and goods.\u000a\u000aSpread more awareness.\u000a\u000aUse buses and trains instead of cars, as they can carry a lot more people in one journey. This brings down pollution.\u000a\u000aWalk or cycle as it does not create any pollution. Regular exercise is good for you too.\u000a\u000aDon't use the car for short trips, a car pool is wise.\u000a\u000aTurn off lights when they are not in use.\u000a\u000aRecycle.\u000a\u000aComposting fruit and vegetable waste reduces garbage dumps and burning of rubbish.\u000a\u000aAvoid using disposable stuff or plastic.\u000a\u000aSwitch to compact fluorescent light bulbs.\u000a\u000aAvoid using pesticides.\u000a\u000aStart a weekly neighbourhood clean up.\u000a\u000aJoin groups and be an active part of the programme \u2014 \u201cSave the ozone layer, save our children\u201d is on Facebook.

Plantation sector holds a lot of potential to earn carbon credit under Kyoto protocol under aforestation/reforestation credits (A/R). Under A/R, plantation projects are given credits as they deposit carbon dioxide in the soil than letting them dissipate into the atmosphere. This process is popularly known as carbon sequestration.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dynamics of can change through earning of carbon credit,\u201d Jacob said.\u000a\u000aPresently, carbon credit from industrial source like from a thermal power project fetches $7-$8 per tonne of carbon dioxide in international market, where as the price for A/R credit is only $4-$5.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is price disparity due to lesser demand from EU nations for these credits,\u201d he added.

This comes at a time when the country is striving to bridge the widening gap in the demand and supply of electricity.\u000a\u000aThis power capacity being held up on environmental grounds forms half the overall capacity addition target for the 12th Plan period and over 80 per cent of the current Plan period\u2019s likely capacity addition of 62,000 Mw. \u201cThe capacity of projects that have come under no-go classification is roughly 50,000 Mw. This includes projects to be commissioned both in the 11th and 12th Plan periods,\u201d confirmed a senior power ministry official. The ministry is pushing for speedy clearances.\u000a\u000aWhat makes matters worse is the latest assessment by the (CEA) that most of the thermal power projects with in no-go areas have already made substantial investments and, therefore, it might not be feasible to allot alternate blocks for such projects at this stage. CEA is the government\u2019s apex planning body under the aegis of the ministry of power.\u000a\u000aThe environment ministry\u2019s categorisation specifies regions where coal mining can be permitted only after stringent forest clearances are obtained. Though this is only indicative in nature, it has worried power project developers, as several existing and upcoming mines now fall in areas barred for mining.\u000a\u000aIndia generates around 700 billion units of power annually, but continues to face an over 12 per cent deficit. While limited availability of coal has always remained a major constraint for power capacity addition, the latest controversy prohibiting mining in certain blocks citing has led the government\u2019s major infrastructure ministries of power and coal to lock horns with the ministry of environment.\u000a\u000aA high-level committee under Planning Commission member B K Chaturvedi is currently trying to work out a mechanism to provide preference to developing the threatened projects during coal block allocation. \u201cThe idea behind the CEA report was to see whether some relaxation is possible for no-go projects.

a((VAs the curtains come down on the three-day Summer Davos conference in Tianjin today, you can't help but take away two strong impressions. One, the daunting challenges facing the world in the early years of the 21st century, particularly those surrounding sustainability which can be addressed only through unprecedented collaboration on the part of business, governments, and society. Two, as we try to meet these challenges, China will play a central but still uncertain role.From the cascade of information that unfolded at Tianjin, all thoughts continued to gravitate towards the events central theme \u2014 Driving Growth Through Sustainability mentored by renowned global business leaders like Eckhard Cordes , chairman of the management board and CEO of Metro Group , the German retailer; Klaus Kleinfeld, chairman and CEO of Alcoa, John S Watson, chairman of the board and CEO, Chevron Corporation . In fact James E Rogers, chairman, president and CEO of Duke Energy Corporation even went on record to state that, within our company, every action, every decision, is made through the lens of sustainability.The issue may be fairly complex but we can get a lot done if businesses are more inclusive and responsible, governments more accountable and society and individuals more alert and participative in their future. What was clear across these multiple debates on sustainability was that no one group can tackle an issue as broad and complex as generating environmentally sustainable economic growth.There has to be a multi-step framework that we need to employ towards this end. First, we have to establish the need for sustainability so that everyone sees it as a win from their point of view i.e. increased profits like quality, increase votes for governments because of awareness amongst citizens and better health. Secondly, we need to figure out how to measure progress through a combination of initiatives like establishment of measurement standards, making disclosures of carbon footprint mandatory and regulation to ensure compliance in defaulting industries and social practices, and finally incentivize action to achieve it. Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus made an interesting point in this context. He said that "we need central funding to drive cross-industry research in alternate fuels, biosciences and nanotechnology to avoid parallel research and restricted access as accelerated implementation of solution is in everyone's interest."Governments and consumers are also integral parts of the solution, and their immediate interests may conflict with those of business and with each other. So which of these parties should will take the lead in creating the difficult but necessary collaboration required to make measurable progress? What are the incentives to get one of the parties to take such a step? Who will finance this change in relationships?The meeting in Tianjin didn't provide answers but you can't find answers until you've identified the right questions.There is hope though as two social innovators reminded us.

These individual remind you that there is indeed hope if you take the first step forward.However, one question that continued to nag me is related to China's role in solving a thorny global issue like sustainability. Cheng Siwei, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congresss statement sums it up well, By the year's end, factories that do not meet energy efficiency requirements will be shut down and their bosses will be punished. If one needed to be reminded that one was in China, this statement pretty much did! You always take a politicians words with a grain of salt, of course. But that feeling was heightened by my ambiguous feelings about China itself.

a((VThe clarification by a United Nations\u2019 official that the Kyoto protocol will continue even after 2012, when its scheduled emission reduction commitment period ends, provides only cold comfort. Unless there are fresh binding commitments for reduction in the emission of environment-injurious (GHGs), the continuation of the toothless Kyoto accord will be pointless. In any case, even the action stipulated in the Kyoto accord for combating global warming fell far short of putting an end to global warming, though it was deemed a good beginning towards that end. Sadly, even the modest GHG reduction targets set for the developed countries under the Kyoto pact are unlikely to be fully met. This apart, the carbon market-based (CDM) launched under the Kyoto protocol has also been found to suffer from several imperfections. It, thus, needs to be either suitably modified or replaced with another better-conceived one. Its key objectives of lowering the overall carbon footprint of the environment and spurring cleaner development in developing countries have remained, by and large, ill-served. By allowing the industrialised countries to meet emission-slashing goals by buying carbon credits from GHG-reduction projects in other countries, it has let them get away without actually cutting down their emissions. Worse still, some of the key claimers of carbon credits in countries like China and India, which together account for 80 per cent of the carbon credits supply, face the accusation that they deliberately produce more than needed amounts of GHG, notably hydro-fluorocarbons like HFC-23 used in refrigeration, in order to burn it to earn carbon credits.\u000a\u000aIt is, therefore, imperative to thrash out a new global agreement to succeed the Kyoto pact, instead of either taking the Kyoto protocol forward or merely putting it in a different mould.\u000a\u000aThis, unfortunately, does not seem to be happening. Differences remain between rich and poor countries on shouldering the responsibilities for curbing global heating. The failure of Copenhagen to provide a road beyond Kyoto has also not helped. Though Copenhagen laid down only a non-binding, minimalist goal for countries to take suitable action that would help limit the increase in global temperature to below 2°C, its proposal to create a green fund to finance clean projects in the poor countries has still not made much headway. It is still uncertain whether donor countries will meet their commitment to provide $30 billion in next three years for this purpose. No contribution worth the name has so far been made. If the next climate conference, scheduled for November in Cancun, manages to get donors to cough up what they promised for this year, it can be judged a success.

A tonne of HFC emitted is equal to 14,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), a report to be released in 2011, had said that total emissions of HCFC are currently faster than four years ago. \u201cThe use of HCFC-22, increased more than 50 per cent faster in 2007-2008 than in 2003-2004,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aDeveloping nations such as India and China got financial incentives to replace CFCs, used in refrigerators, with HCFCs under the Montreal Protocol, signed by 196 nations to reduce ozone depleting substances.\u000a\u000aWhile the entire world, including India, has phased out CFCs, its replacement with HCFCs has caused a climate change problem.

a((VUpdated: Thu, Sep 16 2010. 09 09 PM IST\u000a\u000aCatastrophe: An aerial view of the flooded Sindh province. Vincent Thian/AP; and (top) a UN helicopter drops relief material at Chandan village in Dadu district. Deshakalyan Chowdhury/AFP Pakistan has long rocked itself in a cradle of victimhood, attributing its torments to ploys and conspiracies hatched elsewhere. And so it was perhaps inevitable, after the devastating floods in July, that some in Pakistan blamed the floods on clandestine US and Indian manipulation of monsoon clouds and river flows. It was just as inevitable that we Indians\u2014also habituated to playing the victim, especially in regard to Pakistan\u2014played up our hurt at being blamed for having a role in our neighbour\u2019s national catastrophe. At the geopolitical level, as on the personal one, being offended is a canny way of avoiding more difficult and involving emotions, such as genuine sympathy.\u000a\u000aThe ambivalent way in which the Indian citizenry has thus far addressed the human, social and economic catastrophe facing Pakistan is not just a moral muddle. It could redound to the long-term detriment of India if we fail to understand that our historical enemy is also enmeshed beside us, buffeted along with us, by environmental forces that have little respect for national borders.\u000a\u000aLooking at images of the inundated plains of Punjab and Sindh over the past weeks, reading stories about the massive human displacements that have followed\u2014the largest on the subcontinent since Partition\u2014I was struck by how proximate this natural calamity actually was. It was unfolding a few score miles away from our borders, yes, but it also felt near because it was familiar: a tragedy larger in scale than our floods in 2008 or the floods across southern India last year, but not an alien one. What distances us is a reflexive enmity.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s government did better than its citizenry at taming this impulse. It came forth quickly to offer assistance: first $5 million (around Rs 23 crore) in aid, soon upped to $25 million. This offer, first refused but eventually accepted, provoked criticism in India and Pakistan both. In India, some have rightly pointed out that humanitarian aid to Pakistan often becomes a political tool. In the 2005 earthquake, terrorist-linked organizations distributed aid in order to build support\u2014as they are doing again now, while the Pakistan military has made it a point to stamp its own insignia on aid packages so as to make clear the aid is not coming from the country\u2019s civilian government. But humanitarian aid becomes a political bludgeon in virtually every natural disaster, whether in New Orleans after Katrina or the Gujarat earthquake in 2001. A government that restricts its humanitarian disaster relief to countries that are likely to spend all of it in politically neutral, transparent, accountant-friendly terms is one ready to be of help only during ice-floe emergencies in Sweden.\u000a\u000aAlso Read Sunil\u2019s previous Lounge columns\u000a\u000aWhere our government was responsive, I\u2019ve yet to see parallel efforts on the part of civil society to reach out to the millions of ordinary Pakistanis affected by the floods. It is commonplace among our liberal elites to say that when it comes to the people of Pakistan and India, we are all the \u201csame\u201d\u2014that it is merely the self-interested military and political leaderships that feed and profit from hostility between the countries. So the recent disaster might have been thought to be an opportunity to reach over the generals and politicians and directly address the distress of people not unlike ourselves across the border. It still might be that opportunity, but I\u2019m beginning to wonder.\u000a\u000aOf course, our sense of sympathy and our willingness to help invariably begins closest to home. Edmund Burke long ago wrote of our love for \u201cthe little platoon we belong to in society\u201d. But for Burke the little platoon was simply the starting point, \u201cthe first principle... of public affections... the first link in the series by which we proceed towards a love to our country, and to mankind.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet there seems to be a missing link in that chain when it comes to our neighbour, Pakistan. The reasons why are hardly mysterious. Whatever fellow-feeling there might exist towards the people of Pakistan has obviously thinned in the face of terrorist attacks, martial posturing, and a general aggressiveness that Pakistan seems to have made its stock in trade. The memory of the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008, and of Pakistan\u2019s role in them, are still fresh and painful, and in many minds override the impulse to assist in a humanitarian crisis. But to say that a general unconcern is understandable is not to concede that it is prudent.\u000a\u000aConcerns: (clockwise from top left) The Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008 put Indo-Pak ties back by several decades. Prashanth Vishwanathan / Bloomberg; the Indus. AFP; and a family affected by floods in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Morteza Nikoubaz / Reuters Human sympathy is always a tangle of motives, and one of the motives frequently at work is self-interest. We give because we are in some way better off for having done so. This is very clearly the case for Indians in regard to the current crisis in Pakistan\u2014a case where immediate generosity in distress may help to create an inclination for future cooperation. We\u2019ll need the latter, because the floods there bring into uncomfortable focus a significant danger that India is going to face in coming years\u2014a danger not spoken of with the same intensity as we speak of terrorism, but more connected to it than we usually acknowledge\u2014and sharing with terrorism a lack of respect for borders. I am speaking of the subcontinent\u2019s unravelling ecological crisis, encompassing the distribution of water as well as more general climatic conditions. This crisis is going to provoke mass displacement and unrest as people struggle to find survival habitats.\u000a\u000aBoth terrorism and ecological hazards defy the territorial boundaries of nation states. But they require diametrically opposite modes of approach. Dealing with terror requires a quarantining approach. With large-scale ecological problems, the only plausible approach must be based on cooperation, interconnection and negotiated agreement.\u000a\u000aThe recognition of interconnectivity in so many important domains\u2014global markets and their global crises, security and information media\u2014has made it in many respects the natural lens through which we now view our relationship to the world.\u000a\u000aYet when it comes to our neighbours, those to whom we are most closely physically conjoined, we seem to quite forget this\u2014in favour of a simplified, one-eyed view of what our security consists in, and of how we can hope to safeguard it.\u000a\u000aWe have come to see our security in terms of defending physical borders, amassing hardware that can insulate us against enemies. On the other hand, we\u2019ve tended to see our economic development in terms of global networks and flows of goods and services, through software that can connect us to the wider globe. In each case, we somehow hope to be able to discount the local dysfunctionalities of our region. We imagine we can escape the fact that we live in a part of the world devoid of any working institutions that can coordinate and integrate choices and that can collectively confront predicaments faced by states and governments\u2014institutions able to sustain any degree of trust between neighbouring states. In fact, in their absence, we remain subject to the tyranny of geography\u2014in several respects.\u000a\u000aFirst, given the inability of Pakistan\u2019s state to exercise sovereign control over its territory\u2014an inability that will persist\u2014we are going to remain vulnerable to terrorist infiltration and attacks across borders. We should not expect any foolproof defence against threats emanating from our immediate west: We shall have to settle at best for trying to manage risks. We are going to have to find a modus vivendi, one that enables us to deal with such attacks without exciting ourselves into precipitate action (which, given Pakistan\u2019s policy of determined irresponsibility over its nuclear arsenal, could leave us prey to dire consequences). India and Indians will be bled, perhaps not by a thousand cuts as the generals in Pakistan would like to see, but certainly by more attacks. We shall therefore have to take measures to prevent where we can, and to absorb where we must.\u000a\u000aA strategy of prevention requires us to invest in technologies of surveillance and to develop intelligence capacities\u2014these must have priority over other major defence buys. But in matters of security, prevention is hardly a foolproof strategy. The unforeseen will happen.\u000a\u000aSecond, precisely in order to shore up our security, we\u2019ll also need to think about Pakistan and other neighbours in terms other than of bordered threats.\u000a\u000aThere are a whole series of environmental and ecological threats that don\u2019t respect boundaries and cannot usefully be thought through in terms of the enemy/ally binary: matters to do with climate change and toxic emissions, water management, as well as crucial matters of public health. Such issues, increasingly pressing, cannot be conceived of either in terms of victory or defeat, or in terms of containment beyond our borders. They are Dangers Without Borders. Floods, epidemics, and toxic air pollution do not stop at boundary checkpoints, nor do the internal social upheavals caused by floods or epidemics confine themselves to prescribed territories. They spill over in expected and unexpected ways, and their effects can proliferate long after the actual event.\u000a\u000aIf there is one issue that literally criss-crosses our divided subcontinent, it is water: both in terms of the river systems that flow over and across national boundaries, and the rain clouds that blow across. Yet all across the subcontinent, water has become a source of nativist suspicion and distrust.\u000a\u000aWithin India, we are most familiar with disputes between regional states (Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, for instance) and disputes between citizens and the state (the Narmada dam and many others). But with our neighbours too, water now is a regular point of dispute. Before the floods, ironically Pakistan had taken to complaining that India was stealing the Indus waters from it, not allowing enough to flow through to a country feeling the effects of water scarcity. Indeed, leaders of groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba have alleged Indian water thievery as yet another reason to press their attacks against India. India and Bangladesh have regularly squabbled over the waters of the Ganga, while in India there is now a panicked recognition that the Chinese have set in place major dam works that may drastically affect the flow and course through India of the Brahmaputra.\u000a\u000aOn the issue of river rights, India stands, as in so many matters of its international relations, in an in-between position. On the one hand, it needs to be able to dam and make use of river waters that flow into Pakistan; on the other hand, it needs more transparency and restraint on what China is doing to the Brahmaputra.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s in fact a river\u2014the Indus itself\u2014that has been the subject of the most successful cooperation between India and Pakistan. It is true that the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 is limited as a model for future cooperation. After all, it was essentially a once-and-for-all division of water rights, and not a mechanism whose operation required active cooperation between two governments; and it was always essentially a defensive, negative agreement, prohibiting certain actions rather than enabling and encouraging India and Pakistan to actively work together. Yet, we should see it as a useful example, while recognizing that we\u2019re going to have to find ways to invent new, more positive, kinds of agreements. A first step in trying to move towards such cooperation might be to offer, in a situation of real human need, a more expansive hand of assistance. There\u2019s no guarantee it will be taken as intended\u2014but hadn\u2019t we better try?\u000a\u000aSunil Khilnani is the author of The Idea of India and is currently working on a new book, India in Search of Wealth and Power.

a((VAs the uncertainty over the outcome of the global climate change negotiations continues, carbon consultants are increasingly reinventing their businesses to expand into alternative opportunities in related fields like renewable energy, clean technology and environmental sustainability, irrespective of their carbon component.\u000a\u000aWhile leading carbon consultant Ernst & Young is renewing its focus on clean technology business in the country, corresponding to its global plan to hire 300 specialists for the practice, home-grown Emergent Ventures India (EVI) and Gensol Consultants are diversifying their portfolios to get actively into renewable energy and sustainability services.\u000a\u000aExplaining the development, Paul Simpson, chief operating officer, Carbon Disclosure Project, a UK-based organisation famed for maintaining the largest inventory of carbon emissions of the biggest businesses in the world, says, Its only in keeping with the changing business scenario. Renewable energy has emerged as a bigger business opportunity than the carbon market today.\u000a\u000aWhile the global carbon market was worth $144 billion in 2009, investment in core clean energy (new renewables, biofuels and energy efficiency) amounted to $162 billion.\u000a\u000aBesides, the carbon market is a political market. Its future would be influenced by the outcome of the global climate change negotiations, adds Simpson. It holds true more so for the $2.7-billion global Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which is an instrument under the Kyoto Protocol that allows rich countries to invest in poor countries for offsetting their emissions. As with the rest of the climate change agreement, there is lack of clarity as of now on its continuance after the end of first phase in 2012. The uncertainty poses a business risk for Indian companies, which earned credits worth an estimated Rs 400 crore in 2009, according to Carbon Outlook, a marketplace information tracking resource. The carbon consultants themselves are estimated to have done business worth Rs 60-70 crore.\u000a\u000aThe recent reports about the UN reluctance to issue carbon credits in the case of projects emitting hydroflurocarbons-23 or HFC-23 because of the allegations that certain companies are overproducing them to earn more credits are also lowering the sentiment about carbon trade. It's a cause for concern because Indian companies earned about two-thirds of the carbon credits (50 million) from HFC-23 projects out of a total of 79 million credits last year.\u000a\u000aWhether it's risk diversification to avoid depending solely on carbon markets or expansion to exploit newer avenues of growth, carbon consultants are gung-ho about exploring new business opportunities, particularly in the light of the country embarking on missions like installing 20-gw solar power by 2022 and kickstarting a Rs 74,000-crore energy efficiency trading market under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).\u000a\u000aIn fact, the NAPCC has provided the regulatory framework for Indian companies to pursue a sustainability strategy, which provides a much bigger business opportunity in the entire sustainability market, including carbon, energy and water than the one offered by the CDM market, says Sudipta Das, partner & national leader, Climate Change and Sustainability Services, Ernst & Young. Indian companies are taking a holistic approach on climate change and sustainability and wish to integrate their triple bottom line of sustainability into their business strategies. It is our endeavour to enable them to do so, he adds.\u000a\u000aLikewise, EVI, which has a pipeline of 200 carbon credit projects under CDM, claims to be diversifying to exploit newer avenues of growth. Ashutosh Pandey, CEO, Carbon Advisory Business, EVI, says, Since Indian businesses look beyond carbon when they evaluate climate change issues, we see tremendous growth for our business coming from clean technology and renewable energy.\u000a\u000aPositioning itself as a global climate change consulting company with operations in 10 countries, EVI today seeks to provide services in climate change risk and opportunity management, renewables like biomass, wind, hydro, waste to energy and solar technologies, and energy efficiency. Set up in 2004, the company began initially by offering services in greenhouse gas management, carbon foot-printing and carbon neutrality.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, Gensol Consultants, which was set up in 2007, to offer services in carbon advisory, carbon foot-printing and mitigation, is positioning itself as an emerging renewable energy player. Though Gensol has a robust carbon business with 350 clients and a pipeline of 25 million carbon credits, it has ventured to launch a Rs 350-crore Gensol Renewable Energy Fund to set up 100 mw of wind, solar and hydropower projects.\u000a\u000aGensol has already set up two separate companies Natural Resources Engineering, an EPC company for renewable energy projects, and Greensol Engineering for manufacturing solar modules. Anmol Jaggi, director, Gensol Consultants, says, The carbon business experience has been a great learning experience. It has positioned us to be in all shades of green like renewable energy and energy efficiency. The key is to leverage our experience and harness the emerging opportunities.\u000a\u000aSome companies have simply leapfrogged. According to Raj Prabhu, managing partner, Mercom Capital Group, a Texas/Bangalore-based clean energy communications and consulting firm, it makes sense to leave carbon management, which is about measuring carbon emissions, auditing, accounting and tax planning, to accounting consultancies. We prefer to focus on energy generation and efficiency side of clean energy business, including solar, wind, geothermal, waste-to-energy, biomass and energy efficiency.\u000a\u000aIt seems it is only a matter of time before more such niche consultants mushroom all over the country.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe review by the Inter-Academy Council (IAC) of the working of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was released on August 30, has brought out some interesting facts about the Himalayan glacier controversy.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, besides revealing the weaknesses in the multi-layered process established by the IPCC to review draft chapters of its reports and correct errors, the IAC report highlights the shortcomings in the internal process of review within the government when the reports are received by it for comments.\u000a\u000aThe observation on the Himalayan glaciers in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the IPCC, issued in 2007, was one of the controversial statements in the report that led the Panel to request the IAC on March 10 to ?conduct a thorough and independent review of the processes and procedures followed by the IPCC in preparing its Assessment Reports.?\u000a\u000aThe controversial statement on the Himalayan glaciers appeared in Section 10.6.2 of the report of the Working Group II on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation. Citing a 2005 report of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a non-peer-reviewed (grey) literature, it said: ?Glaciers in the Himalayas are receding faster than in any other part of the world?and, if the present rate continues, the likelihood of them disappearing by? 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate. Its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 km2 to 100,000 km2 by ? 2035.?\u000a\u000aThe WWF report had, in turn, cited a 1999 report of the Working Group on Himalayan Glaciology (WGHG) of the International Commission for Snow and Ice (ICSI) whose chairman at that time was the well-known Indian glaciologist, Syed Iqbal Hasnain, formerly of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and now with The Energy Research Institute (TERI), New Delhi. The ICSI report had also resulted in a New Scientist article in June 1999 that quoted Professor Hasnain as saying that the Himalayan glaciers would vanish within 40 years as a result of global warming.\u000a\u000aInvestigating the error, the IAC committee examined the draft text of the chapter in question and the relevant reviewer comments. The committee's analysis showed that six experts reviewed this section in the first draft and, interestingly, none of their comments was critical. However, at the stage of the second draft, which is sent to both the governments and expert reviewers, two comments were related to the erroneous statement on Himalayan glaciers, but neither of them was from the Indian government or any Indian expert.\u000a\u000aDavid Saltz of the Desert Research Institute, Ben Gunion University, Israel, had pointed to the contradiction in the text, which spoke of glaciers disappearing by 2035, and in the same breath said their total area would shrink by 2035. However, the authors or the review editors ?missed? clarifying this and failed to change the text.\u000a\u000aAnother reviewer, Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University, questioned the conclusions of the section and referred to the work that arrived at different conclusions. Professor Fowler pointed out that measurements by Hewitt suggested that the western Himalayan glaciers were expanding and added that the changes in precipitation and temperature trends, which he along with D. R. Archer had observed, also supported that. After merely noting on the margins, ?Was unable to get hold of the suggested references; will consider in the final version,? the writing team failed to act upon this comment and the final version of the chapter remained unchanged.\u000a\u000aProfessor Fowler and Mr. Archer had said in their 2006 paper: ?The observed downward trend in summer temperature and runoff is consistent with the observed thickening and expansion of Karakoram glaciers, in contrast to widespread decay and retreat in the eastern Himalayas. This suggests that the Western Himalayas are showing a different response to global warming than other parts of the globe.?\u000a\u000aIn contrast to the final version of the WG II report, the final version of the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM), however, does not have any statement on the Himalayan glaciers. This is because the (second) draft version of the report, which is sent to experts and the governments, elicited a response from the Indian government and, interestingly, none from any expert.\u000a\u000aThe remark included in the draft SPM from Section 10.6.2 was: ?If the current warming rates are maintained, the Himalayan glaciers could decay at very rapid rates, shrinking from the present 500,000 km2 to 100,000 km2 by 2030s.? The Indian government had commented: ?This is a very drastic conclusion. Should have a supporting reference otherwise should be deleted.? In response, the writing team removed the contentious statement from the SPM.\u000a\u000aBut what is interesting to note here is the lacuna in the review process within the government machinery. While it, or the experts that it had appointed to review, failed to detect the more drastic statement in the main report, it succeeded in raising the flag on the remark included in the SPM. This only means that the review mechanism had failed to scrutinise the voluminous main report but only went through the 20-page summary.

a((VUpdated: Mon, Sep 20 2010. 11 47 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: India\u2019s efforts to move to greener power using its abundant coal reserves is now just a step away from fruition.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s awaiting the go-ahead from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is to review a presentation of the plan for developing the advanced ultra super critical technology at an investment of around Rs 8,000 crore.\u000a\u000aThe technology will help in increasing the efficiency of coal-based power generation, reduce emissions and extend the life of the country\u2019s coal reserves.\u000a\u000aIt will put India in the league of countries such as the US, Japan and China, who are working to develop a similar technology.\u000a\u000aThe programme will be run by state-owned NTPC Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic research, and involves setting up a 800MW prototype by 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe plan to commission the first prototype plant by 2017. It is a very tight schedule. We are going to make it (presentation to the PM) very shortly,\u201d said R. Chidambaram, principal scientific adviser (PSA) to the government of India.\u000a\u000aThe project will help in improving efficiency (by enhancing the heat energy that can be generated by burning coal) to 45% compared with the 40% efficiency of super critical projects (660MW and above) and reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 740g per kWh compared with 830g per kWh. Every 800MW advanced unit will help reduce annual consumption of coal by 0.15 million tonnes (mt) and emissions by 0.2 mt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe higher you go in terms of steam pressure and temperature, higher is the efficiency... This technology is not available anywhere. We are planning to leapfrog,\u201d Chidambaram added.\u000a\u000aFuel shortages are expected to adversely impact the country\u2019s power generation plans, as around 53.4% of its 164,508MW of power generation capacity is coal-based. The power sector is the biggest consumer of coal in the country, absorbing 78% of the total domestic production. To generate 1MW of power, around 5,000 tonnes of coal per annum is required. By 2032, around 50% of the country\u2019s generation capacity is expected to be coal-based.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe first step we have taken is to have an MoU (memorandum of understanding) between the three organizations,\u201d Chidambaram said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are moving towards a paradigm shift. Our main source of energy is coal and we will be heavily reliant on coal till nuclear (power) comes in. This project will help in lower fuel consumption and less emissions,\u201d said Anil Razdan, former power secretary and scientific consultant (energy technologies) in the office of PSA.\u000a\u000aThe other participating organizations in the initiative include Institute for Plasma Research, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd among others.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will design equipment. The major issue is that the temperatures will be high. To withstand it, exotic materials will be required. We have to design keeping these temperatures in mind. NTPC will provide its stations for the validation of design,\u201d said O.P. Bhutani, director (engineering, research and development) at Bhel.\u000a\u000aThe project, to be funded by the government, will be located at one of the existing sites of NTPC, India\u2019s largest power generation utility. Going forward, the country plans to have 33 such units in the 12th Plan (2012-17) and 36 units in the 13th Plan (2017-22).\u000a\u000a\u201cThe plan envisages two-and-a-half years of design and development, and four-and-a-half years of construction. It will increase efficiency levels substantially and the moment it proves to be commercially viable, a number of projects will be set up,\u201d said D.K.

a((VNEW YORK: India has reached out to small island states, which are the most vulnerable to climate change , to convey its sensitivity to their concerns on the issue, environment minister Jairam Ramesh has said.The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) had asked emerging economies like India and China to take legally binding cuts on carbon emissions at the Copenhagen conference last year.Noting that AOSIS clearly wants India and China, Brazil and South Africa to take on much more ambitious mitigation requirements, Ramesh said: "The whole idea of meeting the AOSIS group was to convey to them that we are sensitive to their concerns.. We have a peninsular India in which 300 million people live in vulnerable coastal areas."In fact, a central component of environment minister Jairam Ramesh's trip to New York this week was to reach out to Small Island States on the climate issue."The capacity building exercise we have announced was widely welcomed by the AOSIS group and we will take it forward," Ramesh said while stressing that India is the first developing country to have published its Greenhouse Gas inventory for the year 2007.Key elements of the Copenhagen Accord include a limit 2 degree rise of global temperature, USD 100 billion on finance in long-term finance to developing countries and $30 billion to short-term finance to the poorest and most vulnerable countries.These tiny nations have contributed 0.3 per cent to global warming want a 1.5 degree Celsius limit.UN scientists have warned that if the 2 degree Celsius is allowed, then there is a very real possibility that some of these nations go under the sea.During the Copenhagen Conference, Palau President Johnson Toribiong had urged China and India to provide technology and finances to poorer countries to combat climate change.

a((VRANCHI: In an initiative to spread ecological awareness among students of government schools, the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board has come up with "Green School" project to make such institutes environment-friendly.The project includes plantation drives in government schools across the state for which saplings would be provided by the forest department."The basic intention is to create environment awareness among students so that they can in turn create awareness in the society at large", said Ashok Sharma, the Ranchi district education officer.As deforestation is a major reason responsible for rise in pollution and change in global climate, the state pollution control board has come up with this plan so that a small step could be taken towards saving the environment.The course would require each and every student to plant one sapling and take care of it. Depending on the care and survival of the plant, each student would be given marks that would be added in their report cards.The concept of saving trees in schools had been introduced with the idea of establishing eco clubs in schools, which was not very successful, as it could not be combined with the marks sheet. But now, with the introduction of "Green School" project, it would not be a matter of choice but compulsion for students to take care of their green friends.This time the success rate of the project seems better than the plight of the eco clubs as this time marks would be given for planting and looking after saplings. "This initiative is a small step towards making children understand the steps to be taken to save the environment in times of global warming and climate change," added Sharma.Letters to all schools have been issued, carrying the directives of the project, and the project would begin after a list of schools in each district is prepared. The list of schools would be needed to assess the requirement of saplings to be provided by the forest department. Once the list is prepared and the requirement of saplings is assessed, then the approximate budget for the project would be decided, said Sharma.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAfter a torrid and unusually hot summer, the monsoon rains could not have been more welcome when they set in over Kerala at the end of May. But the progress of the rain-bearing clouds northwards was sluggish and, by the end of June, the nationwide rainfall deficit stood at 16 per cent. After last year's bad drought, there were some jitters over whether the monsoon might slip once again into the red. In its first seasonal forecast issued in April, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted that it would be a \u2018normal' monsoon with a deficit of only two per cent. In a normal monsoon, the nationwide rainfall is within 10 per cent of the long-period average. An updated forecast issued in late June said that the monsoon could finish with a slight surplus of two per cent, and it mainly relied on the \u201cvery high probability\u201d of a La Nina developing in the Pacific Ocean. A La Nina, characterised by the waters of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific being cooler than usual, is beneficial for the Indian monsoon. That is indeed what has happened. From the third week of July, the rains have been bountiful. With the exception of eastern and north-eastern India, which currently shows an 18 per cent deficit, the rest of the country has received above-average rain.\u000a\u000aYear after year, floods create havoc in some place or other during the monsoon. This year the focus has been on Pakistan where the rising waters have caused millions to flee their homes with livestock and destroyed crops across the country. Although India was spared disaster on such a scale, reports of heavy rains and consequent flooding have come in from many places. The ravages wrought by torrential downpour can be compounded by water being suddenly released from dams and reservoirs that are rapidly filling up. Of course, it is only when the water rises alarmingly that it is released. However, scientific methods are now available to monitor rainfall as it occurs and then estimate the amount of the water that will in due course flow into a reservoir. These methods aid better management of the reservoir, helping to decide in advance when and by how much various sluice gates need to be opened. Such real-time monitoring and management systems are expensive and need extensive customisation. Moreover to minimise flooding downstream they must be put in place for all reservoirs and dams in a river basin. With the grim possibility that climate change could make extreme rainfall a more frequent occurrence, the government needs to take all possible steps to limit flooding and the damage it causes.

a((VMUMBAI: Corroded forest land at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Borivli will soon sustain a unique ecosystem and turn itself into a haven for wildlife. The Bombay Natural History Society BNHS ) has taken up the task of regenerating the land by planting more than 20 species of local trees with the help of volunteers.The degraded forest land in Malad that was earlier occupied by encroaches has been taken up for the eco-restoration project. On Saturday, around 40-odd volunteers with the help of the BNHS team, planted around 100-native species in the forest area.The monsoon is the best time to carry out a plantation drive in the forest. "The aim of the project is to plant around 20,000 trees over three years, which will help restore the ecology,'' said Krishna Tiwari who is handling the City Forest Project of BNHS.The forest department has allowed BNHS to carry out the project in about 25 acres of corroded land in the park. Earlier, the area was encroached upon and the forest department had carried out a demolition drive, after which it was lying barren. "We decided to restore the forest land by involving corporates and volunteers from schools as well as colleges,'' added Tiwari.By restoring shrinking local forests, the department aims to boost the wildlife population, prevent soil erosion and reduce carbon emissions. One of the major challenges facing those implementing the project is to ensure the trees' survival. "But since we are seeking local support and would also be monitoring the site on a regular basis, we hope that the mortality rate is reduced to a minimal,'' said Tiwari.

a((VTourism is bad \u2014 the kind where a bus-load of people jets across the planet to be in 11 places in 10 days. It's bad for the climate, worse for the resources of host countries and devastating for local livelihoods, says Pamela Nowicka, British author and filmmaker. Who'd have thought, uh? In her book \u201cThe No-Nonsense Guide to Tourism\u201d, her documentary \u201cClimate Change? No Thanks!\u201d and during post-screening Q&A sessions, she takes readers / audiences on a journey that ends in establishing tourism's connection to global warming, climate change and exploitation. Pamela was in the city recently to screen her documentary.\u000a\u000aReality bites\u000a\u000aWith one question \u2014 \u201cWho really profits from tourism?\u201d \u2014 Pamela scores off popular notions of the \u2018benefits' of tourism. During her research for the book, she found enough material to make a case that unbridled tourism depletes resources! More proof came during her travels. Tourist have turned towns into recreational areas. One spends two weeks in Malawi or Kenya in total luxury, support for which comes from PR campaign subsidies and easy loans. Infrastructure for big hotels comes at a subsidy to promote tourism. Are local people part of these decisions? Where tourism facilities are built, local residents are shooed away. Where do they go? Are there provisions for alternative jobs?\u000a\u000aTourism is a mass exercise, expected to double in a decade; it works on a huge profit margin. Naturally, glossy image management lures you to a \u201cparadise\u201d, which must not be home. Going abroad, eating out, sleeping in a strange bed, buying hideous trinkets, having \u2018perfect moments' \u2014 we think it's a reward for our 24 x 7 workdays. But, do we think about the consequences? What we do is ecocide, planet death, she says.\u000a\u000aAnd, its effects are visible \u2014 rising temperature, unpredictable monsoon, rising sea-level, water shortage and increased risk of the likes of malaria and dengue\u2026\u000a\u000aTourism is a volatile industry that depends on political and economic considerations. \u201cAnd, of the money earned, I'm astounded to find how little (only the \u2018leakage'!) reaches the local economy,\u201d she says. Tourists get killed; fishing villages turn into swanky tourism resorts\u2026 Tourism brings neither education nor experience. It takes a lifetime to learn about a country, its culture, its people. Yes, places do live by tourism, but only where it's carefully regulated to make it work for the people. Overall, tourism is unsustainable, she asserts.\u000a\u000aPamela's film attempts to highlight the two extremes \u2014 shortage of water as opposed to luxury. And, points to the hidden cost of enjoyment. As, Goutham, an activist, says in the film: \u201cJetting around the world does create problems; brings in climate change. More planes are coming to India, and rainfall has come down.\u201d Many others in the film echo similar sentiments \u2014 tourism income is not enough for us, say the villagers. They add that villages have lost living and farming space. A boy says: \u201cThere are no glaciers in Kashmir, no water here for farmers. All these cars and bikes cause air pollution.\u201d A woman says she has to stay home waiting for the water tankers. A farmer struggling with a 600-ft borewell says: \u201cAugust is now a dry period; our wells do not fill up. Why don't you read about India in books, on the Internet? Why come here?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt's all a myth\u000a\u000aPressing concerns! Says Pamela: \u201cWe continue to increase consumption on a finite planet. There's no magic to set this right.\u201d Her research makes the claim that tourism fosters cultural understanding, a myth. \u201cYou return entrenched in stereotypes. With whom are tourists interacting in Mahabalipuram? Other tourists? No broadening of the mind takes place.\u201d Find the paradise in your backyard, change your lifestyle, she suggests. \u201cThe change is with the tourist. Why don't we all make a difference?\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate Change? No Thanks!\u201d was filmed entirely in Tamil Nadu, and features tourists from the U.K., Canada, Germany and Australia\u000a\u000a***

a((VCHENNAI: As part of its effort to improve water management, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) has appointed a consultant to study the demand for recycled water in an industrial hub near Sriperumbudur, said managing director of CMWSSB , Shiv Das Meena.He was speaking at the Tamil Nadu Water Summit 2010 organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) here on Tuesday. A water directory and water conservation pledge was released by Union minister of state for water resources Vincent H Pala on the occasion.Based on demand, the CMWSSB will start a tertiary and reverse osmosis plant in Koyambedu. The secondary treated effluent will be tertiary treated and further purified through a reverse osmosis procedure and supplied to the industries in Irungattukottai near Sriperumbudur.The consultant has been given six months to complete the study. "The water will be supplied from the new tertiary reverse osmosis treatment plant coming up at Koyambedu. We are also willing to supply other industries if they approach us. But as of now we are just studying the demand in Irungattukottai," said a senior CMWSSB official.The secondary treatment is designed to degrade the biological content of sewage and the purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to raise the effluent quality before it is discharged. Reverse osmosis is done to reduce phosphorous levels in the effluent.The total water supplied to industries in and around the city is 35 million litres per day (MLD). The water demand of industrial units in Irungattukottai is expected to reduce substantially once they start using the recycled water," added the official.Speaking at the conference, Vincent H Pala said nearly 37% of the state's groundwater has been exploited. "Using strict norms and rainwater harvesting measures this problem can be mitigated," he said.Another problem he highlighted was that out of the 900-km coastline, 640km are vulnerable to erosion. "Only 40km are adequately protected. If urgent measures are not taken, climate change may cause a rise in sea level. This will result in the salination of groundwater," he said.S Raghupathy, senior director of CII Godrej green building council, said the CII is planning to start a campaign to save water in industries. "The industries have a potential to save 40% of the water they use. At the national level, the total average consumption of industries is just 5%. Industries should also try to ensure zero discharge of effluents," he said.

File Photo: AP/Wildlife Conservation Society\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aThe world\u2019s greatest migration spectacle \u2014 the annual charge of nearly 2 million wildebeest, zebra and other mammals across east Africa \u2014 is under threat from plans to build a road across their route.\u000a\u000aTwenty-seven conservation experts from around the world have put their names to a two-page article in the journal Nature condemning the plan, adding to growing international concern including thousands of signatures on petitions opposing the Tanzanian government project.\u000a\u000aBarring the herds from their traditional dry-season feeding grounds to the north would, the scientists argue, lead to population crashes in the prey species \u2014 and the predators that depend on them. The scheme could also lead to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of the entire Serengeti ecosystem, from the vegetation which acts as a massive store of carbon dioxide to the world-famous sight of wild dogs, rhinoceros, lions and cheetah.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe proposed road could lead to the collapse of the largest remaining migratory system on Earth \u2014 a system that drives Tanzania\u2019s tourism trade and supports thousands of people,\u201d conclude the authors. \u201cSuch a collapse would be exceedingly regrettable for a country that has consistently been a world leader in conservation.\u201d The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has also issued a statement saying it has \u201cutmost concern\u201d about the proposed road, and warning \u201cit could result in irreversible damage to the property\u2019s \u2018outstanding universal value.\u2019\u201d In a move which has prompted speculation that UNESCO could strip the Serengeti of its status as a world heritage site if the road is built, the body has also asked for a report on \u201cthe state of conservation\u201d to consider at its 2011 annual meeting.\u000a\u000aAbout 1.5m hectares of savannah grasslands and plains, riverine forest and woodlands make up the Serengeti national park, stretching across northern Tanzania from Lake Victoria half way to the east coast of Africa, and from the Ngorongoro game park to Kenya\u2019s famous Masaai Mara safari attraction in the north.\u000a\u000aEach year over 1.5 million wildebeest and zebra, accompanied by gazelle and packs of predators, flee north at the end of the wet season, between April and June, to the only permanent river in the region, the Mara, and the wetter feeding grounds. Across this vast area they drive a rare ecosystem by eating huge quantities of plant life, recycling nutrients through truckloads of dung and urine, and trampling seeds across the landscape.\u000a\u000aThe planned 53km road linking Lake Victoria to highways to the east coast ports and capital, Dar es Salaam, was announced during the 2005 national election of President Jakaya Kikwete, and is scheduled to begin construction in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe letter in the latest edition of Nature was prompted by growing concern as political pressure for the project has mounted in the run up to next month\u2019s (OCT) next national election, said Prof Andrew Dobson of Princetown University in the US, the lead author of the opinion article.\u000a\u000aThe authors argue that once built, the gravel road will attract faster and heavier lorry traffic, including at night, leading to a growing number of collisions with wild animals; this in turn will lead to pressure for a tarmac road surface and a fence along the route, physically barring the great migration route.\u000a\u000aSimilar experiences in other national parks, including Banff in Canada, Mikumi in Tanzania, and the great Kgalagadi Transfrontier national park the other side of Africa, and the similar destruction of six of the world\u2019s last 24 terrestrial migratory species, including caribou in northern Canada and pronghorns in the western U.S., make this a real threat, said Dobson. In addition, control over the road and 50m either side would be turned over from the national park authority to the roads department, he said.\u000a\u000aInstead, opponents \u2014 including conservationists working in Tanzania and the tourist industry in Kenya which fears it will also suffer a great loss of wild animals \u2014 want the government to consider an alternative route to the south of the park. Although the lorries would have to travel further, there would be a similar length of road to construct to link existing highways; the income from 90,000 annual tourists to these and other connected game parks would be protected; and five to eight times as many people would benefit from links to trade in a more populated region of the country, they say.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not against road being built, but there\u2019s a much better alternative that serves more people, that has a win-win-win of maintaining one of the biggest wildlife sights in the world and one of the biggest carbon sinks,\u201d added Dobson.\u000a\u000aOther conservation groups who oppose the plan include the RSPB in the U.K., the U.S. based Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Zoological Society of London.\u000a\u000aCopyright: Guardian News & Media 2010

a((VMad about the game I have just returned from a short trip to the East Coast of the United States of America. I went there to participate in a strategy meeting. The location consisted of a pristine 400 acres of green lawns and 19th century mansions that now houses PGA golf courses with undulating fairways, manicured greens and stretches of challenging sand bunkers. The mansions are let out for conferences and meetings of the type I had gone to attend. The place is located alongside one of the most prestigious US universities bearing the name of the town in which the sprawling campus resides. On arrival in the town and driving through the estate, my first reaction was that of regret for not carrying my golf gear with me. As our meetings progressed, my regret was gradually tempered by bouts of rain and the sight of diehard golfers soldiering on, drenched and bent against cold gusts of wind. I was happy to watch them play from the warmth of the meeting room instead of being among them in such inclement weather. A stunning sight, the next morning, amazed me and has provoked me to write this piece. An overnight heavy rainfall had apparently made the sand bunkers soggy. A fairly large number of amateur players were expected on the course that day. Giant industrial air-blowers, mounted on mobile platforms, were being operated to dry the sand bunkers in order to make them playable by the time the amateurs arrived to play. I was shocked by the sight of sand bunkers being blow-dried as I had never before witnessed such a scene. If this was the way they were going to dry the bunkers along the length of the golf course, I wondered about the value of the carbon debit this single golf course was accumulating for the benefit of a handful of amateur golfers. The climate change sceptics, especially in the US, would scoff at my concern. And, in any case, the US being the largest per capita consumer of energy in the world, I could see why it has been consistently opposing every global treaty to reduce carbon footprint. By the end of our meeting and on my way back, I wondered how the habit of mindless waste of energy might be more widespread in the US and if the consequences of such unquenchable demand for energy might have been responsible for the recent BP offshore blowout in Florida or even, more frighteningly, for the conjuring of the bogey of the weapons of mass destruction that led to the disastrous war in Iraq. I love to play as well as watch the game of golf and am proud that Arjun Atwal became the first Indian to win a US PGA title. However, I am unable to reconcile myself to the game becoming an energy-guzzling monster, especially when electrical air-blowers are employed to dry bunkers so that 40 or 50 amateur golfers can have a good round of golf, in spite of nature willing otherwise. The university town is well known for its Nobel laureates and Fields Medal winners, so it is a tragedy that this reputation is in such stark contrast to a golf course where wet bunkers are air-dried for amateur golfers’ pastime. In the end, I was glad that I had not carried my golf gear. I would not have had the heart to play a round even if it had not rained.

a((VTARGET: This borehole in Dertu, Kenya, may look no different from thousands of villages that dot the landscape of sub-Saharan Africa. But it is one of `Millennium Villages' envisoned as launch pads for a mass leap out of poverty. | Photo Credit: Khalil Senosi\u000a\u000aPeople often ask me what I consider to be the highlight of my career with the United Nations. While there were many wonderful moments, hosting the largest collection of world leaders ever assembled to sign the Millennium Declaration in New York is certainly among the top. The can-do-spirit in the room was infectious. And, for once, the gulf between rich and poor, between countries often at loggerheads with each other, seemed to be bridged by a genuine partnership among nations and people. Development issues were finally elevated to the highest political level. And, for the first time, developing countries were challenged to translate their development vision into nationally-owned plans.\u000a\u000aThe eight goals and the results\u000a\u000aThere is no doubt that the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and their framework of accountability have served the world well. They have not only provided a much-needed sense of direction to national plans and international cooperation, they have also delivered measurable results. We have seen primary school enrolment rates double in Ethiopia and Tanzania. Countries like Malawi and Algeria transform themselves from food importers to food exporters. We have seen HIV infections fall significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the number of reported malaria cases halve in high-burden countries such as Rwanda and Zambia. All around the world, we have seen efforts to achieve MDG-based targets improve the lives of millions of people.\u000a\u000aHowever, we are still far from achieving what we set out to do. Too many people remain caught in extreme poverty, too many remain hungry and sick, too many mothers die in childbirth, and too many children still do not go to school. We are also not yet doing enough to meet basic needs and fulfil basic rights, to protect the environment, to build effective international partnerships for development, or to harness private entrepreneurship to deliver public goods and services to those in need.\u000a\u000aThe challenges are still great and the circumstances have not become any easier since the Millennium Summit. Back then, there was palpable confidence that the world's problems could be addressed collectively and an open acknowledgement that, in a world of plenty and astounding technological progress, the poverty, hunger, and relative depravation that so many of our fellow human beings still faced was intolerable.\u000a\u000aThat confidence has now faded, and the international consensus on development is in danger of crumbling under the weight of successive crises and a changing world order \u2014 even as the true significance of our growing interdependence is becoming increasingly obvious. The disappointing Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen was an unfortunate example of this paradoxical trend. On the one hand, the appreciation that global problems cannot be solved in one country or continent alone is growing. On the other hand, this is not translated into decisive action and overdue reform of global governance. Lack of concerted leadership and cumbersome institutional arrangements on the international level and a growing array of financial and political pressures on the national level are proving to be formidable obstacles.\u000a\u000aSerious investors needed\u000a\u000aI am worried that these obstacles risk may have made the September 20-22 MDG Review Summit in New York a futile exercise, characterised by grand speeches and carefully-worded promises, but followed by little meaningful action.\u000a\u000aSeveral important donors have already reneged on their commitments, or at least relaxed their development efforts. They have used a variety of justifications ranging from concerns about aid efficiency to the need for a more comprehensive approach to achieving development objectives. As a result, the latest projections predict an aid shortfall of around $21 billion against the global targets. While I agree that a more coherent and results-oriented approach to development is needed, this should not be used as an excuse to cut financial assistance at the first sign of difficulties. The MDGs do not need fair-weather friends, but serious investors in for the long haul.\u000a\u000aPolitical will\u000a\u000aRevitalising the political will to achieve the MDGs, and scaling up proven interventions, is the linchpin to success. As instigator and guardian of the MDGs, the U.N. has an important role to play in this process and the High Level Advocacy Group created by Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon is a welcome step in the right direction.\u000a\u000aThe primary responsibility, however, rests with national leaders. Their challenge is to re-articulate a compelling case for global solidarity and equitable growth. One that embraces but goes beyond aid. One that addresses the growing inequalities between male and female, rural and urban, rich and poor. One that does not measure development and progress purely in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) but also of the quality and sustainability of growth. The message must be that the achievement of the MDGs is not optional, but an essential investment in a fairer, safer and more prosperous world.\u000a\u000aBut achieving the MDGs is only the first step. For even if we succeed and meet all the eight goals by 2015, almost a billion people will continue to live below the poverty line. Hundreds of millions will remain hungry. Millions will continue to die from preventable diseases or unnecessary complications.\u000a\u000aWe will certainly need to take the MDGs to the next level after the initial deadline. While there is some scepticism about the utility of naming specific goals as basis for development strategies and institutional arrangements, I remain an advocate. After all, who can argue with an objective as simple and powerful as access to food and clean drinking water, jobs, health care and education for everyone?\u000a\u000a( Kofi Annan was U.N. Secretary-General between 1997 and 2006. He now chairs the Africa Progress Panel (www.africaprogresspanel.org) and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (www.agra-alliance.org), and heads the Kofi Annan Foundation (www.kofiannanfoundation.org).)

a((VThe economy versus environment debate (see Ideas caFE on the opposite page on todays print edition) isnt going to get resolved in a hurry, despite the Prime Ministers intervention in a few cases. Speaking at the Express Groups Idea Exchange yesterday, parliamentary affairs minister Prithviraj Chavan said that environmental clearances would have to conform to both the letter and the spirit of the law. Mumbai needs another airport, the minister who hails from Maharashtra said, but the option of fixing the environment later while letting GDP grow first simply did not exist in todays circumstances of climate change.\u000a\u000aMore important, not all projects have an environment issue, is what Chavan pointed out on the possibility of getting critical legislation through Parliament. Given the number of seats the party has in Parliament, the only way it can get legislation through the Rajya Sabha is with the Left or the BJPs support, by and large. This means critical concessions on some occasions and a lot more uncertainty on otherswhile the Supreme Court has put off the Ayodhya judgement by another week, it is very possible the BJP attitude on cooperation may change once the judgement comes out, though leaders like LK Advani seem to be cautioning against that. Chavan cited one instance, that of the biotech regulatory Bill, where it has taken the government seven years already to iron out differences and in this case, the health minister now wants to have a look at itthe government is hopeful of being able to bring it in the winter session. In the case of other Bills where the BJP is likely to support the governmentInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Billthe problem is the differences between the constituents of the UPA. In the education tribunal Bill, Sushma Swaraj is on record saying the problem was not so much with the BJP as it was with constituents of the ruling coalition. All of which means these critical pieces of legislation, including the land acquisition one, arent going to happen quickly since it is unlikely the government would like to clear a Bill with the Oppositions support instead of that of its own constituents.

Of the total fleet of 4,700 buses, the BEST has only 12 that meet the new standards.\u000a\u000aThese buses have been procured recently under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Renewal Mission (JNNURM). There are around 2,000 buses in the fleet that follow the Euro III norm, while the remaining buses purchased years ago have Euro II as the set standard.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe new norm was introduced only in April 2010. We conform to pollution standards and will try our best to see that engines and fuel are efficient and emit less pollution,\u201d BEST general manager, OP Gupta, said.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, sources in the BEST said the remaining 187 buses coming under the JNNURM don\u2019t conform to Euro IV standards as the order to manufacture them was given before April.\u000a\u000aThe basic difference between Euro IV and Euro III norms is that the emission levels of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and carbon monoxide are lower by 10 per cent. \u201cAlthough the emission levels under Euro III and Euro IV are lower, the total pollution level will remain more or less the same as there are many buses running on the roads,\u201d said Rishi Aggarwal, director, Centre for Sustainable Transport.\u000a\u000aRecently, the Ministry for Petroleum set norms for Euro IV grade fuel for 13 cities including Mumbai, and Euro III, which has ultra-low sulphur and benzene, for the rest of the country.\u000a\u000aWhen the Euro IV grade fuel was launched in April, petrol prices were hiked by Rs 0.50 per litre and diesel by Rs 0.26 per litre, while the prices of petrol were raised by Rs 0.26 per litre and diesel by Rs 0.21 a litre under Euro III across India.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, BEST plans to introduce a new 40-seater air-conditioned bus, manufactured by Mercedes, by October.

"I urge all leaders present today to commit to reducing biodiversity loss." UN states have missed an agreed 2010 deadline to achieve "a significant reduction" in the rate of wildlife loss, the UN chief said.That's because the international community is locked in a battle on how to set up a panel to assess the Earth's biodiversity. The mooted organization, the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, would list Earth's species at global and regional level, and spell out the value of them.But diplomatic sources said the establishment of the group could be delayed, with developing countries holding out for a system that would give poor countries payments for the use of genetic "patrimony" \u2013 unique species of plants or animals that are found to have a commercial or medical use.

a((VThe current debate concerning development versus environment is premised on the fatal assumption that the two are in contradiction with each other. The background to the debate is the recent activism of the Union environment and forests ministry.\u000a\u000aThat we need economic development to meet our most pressing challenge of bringing 400-500 million citizens out of poverty and deprivation is unarguable. Economic growth is the only way to create jobs and help people achieve their aspirations. Take a poll anywhere in India today and if asked to choose, a vast majority of Indians would choose economic development over environmental protection. It's not necessarily right, but it reflects the priorities as people see it. Wallets will win over the environment for a vast majority.\u000a\u000aWhat the current debate is doing is spotlighting the nature and consequences of this economic growth. The general perception of the exploitative nature of a large number of investments has helped fuel the recent backlash against the anything-for-economic development model. However, neither is the extreme alternative practical. India is a large nation with serious challenges that have to be met through economic development. This is a given and some costs in terms of environment will have to be borne by the nation. The challenge is to quantify the environmental costs and to ensure that these are the minimum possible as we develop a more consistent approach to environmental regulation.\u000a\u000aFirst, we need an alternate sustainable development model (SDM), which unlike the catchy-sounding but spending-oriented slogan of inclusive development should be defined very specifically. The crux of our SDM must be that communities determine their own fate, not a Central minister or his bureaucrat sitting miles away. Such a model will empower communities to force developers to consider the potential benefits of economic development (jobs, taxes etc) versus the potential costs to environment at each stage. So, if the tribal communities in Orissa seek to preserve their traditional lands in the way they have tilled it for generations, they would have their way. There will evolve different types of development zones. Some may prohibit development completely, others may encourage non-polluting and non-mining investments, a few may encourage mining subject to adequate returns to the local community etc. Communities that are eager to embrace economic development and creation of jobs will welcome investment, managing environment costs subject to a national framework.\u000a\u000aApart from this involvement of communities, there is a need for more transparent regulations. Notwithstanding the current minister's pro-active actions, there are lingering questions: is this part of a consistent set of regulatory actions or is this political? The fact that there is such a question being posed is argument enough to move to a more credible and modern environmental regulation. A US-style Environmental\u000a\u000aProtection Agency at central and state levels is what we need. Politicians and bureaucrats don't make for either good or credible custodians of the environment.\u000a\u000aThe author is MP and convenor, ABIDEe task force for a better Bengaluru\u000a\u000aSunita Narain\u000a\u000aThe cost of repairing the damage we do to the environment is huge. So it cannot be the economy first and the environment later\u000a\u000aThe answer to the question of whether environment or industry comes first is much more clear than its counterpart concerning the chicken and the egg. It is evident that without environmental management and safeguards, there can be no development. The reason is twofold. First, development is based on natural resources\u2014the environment, be it water or forest or land\u2014and its degradation will invariably lead to losses for the economy. Second, the costs of repair of the damage we do to the environment, in terms of our health or in terms of pollution, are exorbitant and will also cost the economy big time. So, it cannot be GDP first and environment later. This just does not work.\u000a\u000aBut what can be negotiated is the balance that we strike in making development work. There is no doubt that industrial growth will lead to environmental damage. The question is how this damage can be averted or minimised. In other words, we have to find governance structures that are robust and credible enough to take these decisions in the interests of all.\u000a\u000aIndian industry has erred in its understanding of the challenge of balancing the demands of development and environment. First, it has not realised that in our country, environment forms the survival base for large numbers of people. Therefore, the destruction of environment impinges on their lives. It destroys their forests, which give them firewood, building materials or livelihoods. It destroys their land, which too gives them livelihoods. It pollutes their rivers, which in turn degrades their only source of drinking water or irrigation. Protecting the environment is critical for the living economies of millions of people in India. Their occupations are as important for economic growth as industry is and must continue to be. It is also clear that today's modern industry are not able to offer replacement economic options to the very poorest in the country. It has no business, therefore, to destroy what it can never repair.\u000a\u000aAlso, industry has never invested in improving the regulatory systems in India. In fact, in the past decade or so, as industrial growth has intensified, the aim has been to belittle the environmental clearance mechanism and to outsource and ultimately corrupt the processes of decision-making. Worse, industry has worked diligently to mock and negate the only process via which they would listen to people's problems\u2014the statutory public hearing, done before clearance is given to any project. So, we have a much maligned and institutionally weakened environmental regulatory system. This is not good for taking decisions which work in the interests of both industry and environment.\u000a\u000aFinally, industry has not internalised the inherent problems of trying to fix environmental damage as it creates these problems. It still believes that it can first pollute and then clean up. But that will not work, as affordable technologies are limited in our world. The business of pollution is expensive, we must realise. The challenge of balancing the development and environment imperatives requires rethinking growth and making economies work in the interests of all. Not pitting growth against growth.\u000a\u000aThe author is director, Centre for Science and Environment\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

a((VTwenty years, 25 amendments, several committees and notifications after, the issue of regulating development along India's coastlines remains under debate. The latest to run into a roadblock is the draft notification of the Coastal Regulation Zone 2010, allowing slum redevelopment within the no-go zone (with private participation) and tourism facilities along shorelines - seen as a potential unleashing of construction and consequent ecological destruction.The first rules to regulate the country's 7,500km coastline came through in 1991. They were followed by a phenomenal 25 amendments in the next two decades. Then, in an attempt to provide a systematic overhaul to the coastal regime, a committee was formed under M S Swaminathan in 2004. The committee ran into controversy. Oddly, the fisherfolk communities as well as the builder lobbies opposed the report tooth and nail.The Union environment and forests ministry came up with a draft Coastal Management Zone regulations in 2008 which most claimed had selectively used by the government to push for changes it already was intending to bring in. But a tide of protests ensured that the draft never got accepted by the MoEF.In 2009, yet another committee was set up, with M S Swaminathan and Centre for Science and Environment director Sunita Narain as two experts from outside the government, along with M S Mauskar, additional secretary with the environment and forests ministry.The report politely asked for the earlier committee recommendations to be junked and a reinforcement of the original 1991 rules, with stricter monitoring and regulation. It also recommended a stronger regime to protect the fisherfolk and their rights.Based on the new report, Union environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh undertook public hearings across the country - an intelligent move to get political and social buy in \u2013 and the ministry came up with a 'pre-draft' Coastal Management Zone regulations which were put up for public comment.But the controversy over the six-year process didn't end there. Every interested party, from fisherfolk groups and environmental NGOs to state governments reacted strongly to the pre-draft version. More than 150 substantial comments poured in.One of the authors of the second report, Sunita Narain, reacted sharply to the pre-draft version, claiming that the proposed rules did not go by the recommendations she and her colleagues had made. She said that the rules by sleight of hand were imposing the regime that the earlier M S Swaminathan report had suggested and most had protested against. She also slammed the exceptions the proposed rules make for states like Kerala and Goa and cities like Mumbai.The MoEF, after receiving comments on the 'pre-draft' version has now come up with a draft notification. Some of the key areas of dispute remain embedded in the draft notification and the government will now have to resolve these before it can end the 6-year impasse on how to regulate development along the vast coastline of the country.Among the key issues being debated is that the new draft could be used to do away with the 500m high tide line no-development zone that is imposed at present.The 25 amendments brought in over the last two decades, some of them extremely contentious, have been accepted into the new draft. These include amendments that allow the Navi Mumbai airport, nuclear power plants, special economic zones and tourism facilities to come up along the shoreline.Besides, the government has also agreed to a special dispensation for Mumbai to redevelop slums, which could lead to an unmanageable housing boom along the already crowded shoreline and displace the poor. Similar dispensations forKerala and Goa too could provide space for backdoor entry to large land developers.While a key demand, through the two decades, was to protect the livelihood and rights of traditional fisherfolk living and working along the coast, the ministry of environment and forests has deferred the move by shifting the onus on the agriculture ministry to come up with a new set of rules or a law to do so.

a((VClimate change is affecting all of India, but is particularly devastating to millions of vulnerable farmers who struggle year after year to support their families. Climate change scientists have warned that as the world gets warmer, we will experience a stronger hydrological cycle. In laypersons terms, we will get more intense rain and more intense droughts. Heavy rainfall, prolonged heat waves and other extreme weather conditions will become more commonplace, and we will see greater variability on a year-to-year basis. Extrapolating temperature patterns from the past 60 years, the heat wave in Russia is a once every 400 years event! The Pakistan floods have no parallel in recorded history.\u000a\u000aIndia has a National Action Plan for Climate Change, a comprehensive document that has prompted eight different National Missions. Moreover, the government has declared it will charge a Rs 50 per tonne tax on domestic and imported coal that will raise Rs 3,000 crore this year and eventually over Rs 10,000 crore per year. Along with other centrally sanctioned funds, the government has set aside Rs 25,000 crore to focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation.\u000a\u000aWhile national plans and central funding are needed, actually helping vulnerable populations in some of our poorest states is a daunting challenge. Droughts and floods afflict our vulnerable hinterlands of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Orissa, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Jharkhand is this years example. The states farmers rely largely on rain-fed crops, because barely 9% of the fields are irrigated. This year, as the drought drags on, rice seedlings cannot be transplanted, and harvests are going to fail. Farmers are abandoning agriculture and moving to the cities to find jobs. This is the same pattern of agricultural collapse as in Andhra Pradesh and Vidharbha in prior years.\u000a\u000aDryer weather also means ground water levels continue to drop precipitously. Farmers who rely on tube well water will soon find that they have to dig deeper and use more energy to irrigate their crops. With less water for irrigation, todays wasteful irrigation systems will have to become more frugal. Ancient water reservoirs are evaporating rapidly, and drinking water is becoming harder to get from traditional sources.\u000a\u000aAgriculture-based lifestyles that have existed for thousands of years are under threat. India is already seeing large-scale migration of farming familiesthis is likely to accelerate with the effects of unpredictable weather cycles.\u000a\u000aTo prevent these dire outcomes, we have to rethink our traditional agricultural technologies and come up with sustainable business models for new technology solutions. Low-cost drip irrigation systems, solar powered water pumps, filtration plants for clean water, rain water harvesting and storage, drought-resistant seedsour entrepreneurs will have to develop a wide range of technologies to protect our farmers from unpredictable weather. Government funding will have to stimulate market-based approaches to solving these problems; traditional big government approaches cannot scale fast enough or work alone.\u000a\u000aIn addition to agricultural innovation, financial inclusion is critical. Farmers need access to micro-insurance, forward contracts, and other financial products that will help to smooth erratic agricultural earnings. They need loans so that they can invest in new technologies and livestock. Children need access to student training and educational loans in order to find a way out of agriculture. Our financial system has to transform itself so that it can serve unbanked rural customers.\u000a\u000aOur hinterlands contend with abysmal poverty, corrupt local governance, Maoist insurgency, and now unpredictable weather patterns triggered by a warming planet. Moreover, unpredictable weather compounds many of our other major challenges such as urbanisation, job creation in the formal sector, and domestic security. Jared Diamonds book Collapse documents how societies have disappeared because they could not cope with climate changes. Our history warns us toothe Indus Valley civilization collapsed when its rivers dried up. While state and local governments struggle to deliver even basic services such as education and food security, we must tap market-based approaches, agricultural innovation, and financial inclusion to prepare rural India to cope with climate change and prepare for the future. India has the opportunity to learn from the lessons of history.\u000a\u000aThe author is MD, Omidyar Network India Advisors. These are his personal views

On climate change, Luis said the earth's average surface temperature has risen by 0.76 degrees Celsius since 1850. Carbon emissions which effect climatic changes, form a blanket in the upper atmosphere of the earth and prevent heat from escaping. "In Goa, summers have been warmer during the last few years and the minimum temperatures are also on the higher side," Luis said. Similarly, the sea-level rise may inundate more areas, but may not cause so much erosion, though it is a natural phenomenon during the monsoon, he said.Explaining, he said a sea-level rise of 2 mm per year is negligible but it is likely that increase in wind energy may be the cause of beaches being hit by waves of more amplitude. Stating that more data is needed to explore this aspect, he said, "We have to measure the wind speeds at different locations." Rainer Lohmann, a scientist at the School of Oceanography , University of Rhode Island, USA, said heat waves and droughts have increased due to climate change, leading to disaster-like wildfires and crop failures. Baban Ingole, an NIO fisheries scientist, said the impact of climate change will be adverse on fisheries. "Jellyfish are now seen more often on beaches. They can tolerate higher temperatures and they feed on abundantly available food such as zooplankton and fish larvae, which are also food for bigger fishes," said Ingole.He added that the invasive jellyfish species can impact the food chain. He also said that the population of sardines is increasing because they frequent waters with warmer temperatures and find a suitable habitat off the Konkan coast. Meanwhile, Maruthabu Sudhkar, scientist and advisor to MoEF, said 527 eco clubs have been instrumental in carrying out eco activities in the state and an energy audit programme has been undertaken by schools towards mitigating climate change. Resource materials including an action plan to offset carbon emissions and a pledge for school children were released as part of the workshop.It also sought to sensitize eco teachers in schools, higher-secondaries and colleges to form eco clubs and to build a cadre of young green minds. National green corps (Goa) nodal officer and chief scientist, science and technology department, Goa, Joseph Rauto de Souza, Deepak Parab, George F and Bolmax Pereira also spoke at the workshop.

a((VWASHINGTON: In an unusual remark, Pakistan's ambassador here Hussain Haqqani has said that one of the reasons for recent devastating floods in his country could be human activity on the heavily-militarised Siachen glacier Haqqani told the American lawmakers that snowmelt pattern on the glacier was changing over the past few years, because of intense military activities and scientists in his country were studying whether this was adding to warming factor leading to bizarre climatic changes.Besides, the activity on the glacier, Haqqani said other contributing reasons for unprecedented rains in his country could be greenhouse gas emissions.Briefing the house select committee on energy independence and global warming on recent floods in Pakistan, Haqqani claimed that Islamabad was making efforts to get the glacier de-militarised."So it is something that requires more study and it is one of the subjects that climatologists in India and Pakistan were studying together," he told the lawmakers.He told the lawmakers that rising greenhouse emissions by factories, motorways, and even farm animals across the world was contributing to the rising global temperatures.Noting that Pakistan's carbon footprints were miniscule, Haqqani said Pakistan was bearing the burden of profligate use of Earth's natural resources by others.Responding to queries by Congressmen, he acknowledged that the devastating floods would have its adverse impact on the ongoing fight against terrorism in the country."We have a potential for unrest, which has security implications. There will be prospective possibility of insurgent and extremist groups taking advantage of the circumstances. In the flood relief we have seen, we have had to divert our security forces towards providing immediate flood relief," he said.Haqqani said there is already tension between India and Pakistan for political reasons and water becomes another issue between the countries. "It is also a potential issue between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Management of a disaster of this nature would require greater cooperation in the region and probably on a wider scale," he added."So all of those factors have security implications and to the extent that to the United States's own security is directly linked to security in our region, it's something that the America public and decision makers need to consider," he cautioned US lawmakers.The Pakistani ambassador thanked India for its humanitarian gesture of contributing USD 25 million for flood relief in his country."The gesture was appreciated in Pakistan," he said. He said that the assistance that came from India through the United Nations became part of a bigger pool of resources that were made available to the flood victims.

a((VThe US-India military-to-military relationship is dynamic, strategic and multifaceted, and one of the most important parts of the overall US-India partnership. Our defence relations have evolved from primarily military-to-military exchanges to a more comprehensive relationship that encompasses dialogues, exchanges, exercises, defence sales and practical cooperation.\u000a\u000aAction, or in this case, travel and attention, speak louder than words. As proof that the US-India military relationship is growing and expanding, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, commander of the US Pacific Command Admiral Robert Willard, Deputy Secretary of Defence William Lynn, and Undersecretary for Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy all have visited India in 2010. This week, US Secretary of Defence Gates will host Minister of Defence AK Antony in Washington to discuss regional and global security and further advance our military relationship.\u000a\u000aOne of the key features of the US National Security Strategy, released in May, is the focus of American engagement on galvanising the collective action that can serve common interests such as combating violent extremism, stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and securing nuclear materials, and forging cooperative solutions to the threat of climate change, armed conflicts and pandemic diseases. The starting point of that collective action will be our engagement with partners so that we can cooperate on issues of regional and global concern, with the recognition that power, in an interconnected world, is no longer a zero-sum game.\u000a\u000aIt is no accident, therefore, that the US National Security Strategy calls the relationship with India a top priority, as the US and Indias specific security interests are converging. The US and Indian perspectives are increasingly viewed through a strategic prismseeing common interests, shared outcomes and identical threats.\u000a\u000aFor example, both countries have a mutual interest in the free passage in the Indian Ocean and surrounding waterways. The US and Indian economies and our continued prosperity will rely on effective maritime security that can be provided by increased cooperation between our two navies and coast guards, which is just one of the many areas of expanded cooperation mentioned in the Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative that our governments signed in July.\u000a\u000aBoth countries have a mutual interest in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Working together, our efforts can help counter this threat to regional and global security. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Barack Obama worked on this issue together at a summit in April 2010.\u000a\u000aBoth countries have a mutual interest in the long-term stability and reconstruction of Afghanistan. The US is committed to deepening and building a strategic partnership that addresses security, prosperity and development for an independent Afghanistan. India is doing its part, playing a positive role in Afghanistans economic and social development, which the US strongly supports. Indias continued involvement will play a key part in Afghanistans future success. We both view this challenge in the same strategic manner.\u000a\u000aWith so many shared security interests, it is not surprising that our military relationship has expanded and deepened in the past five years.\u000a\u000aIndia is now conducting more exercises with American forces than it is with any other nation in the world. We now have regular exercises across all services that are growing in complexity as both militaries become more familiar with each other. As an example, India has sent a team of naval and army officers to participate in the Habu Nag exercises in Okinawa.\u000a\u000aAs our interests and vision for the future converge, so do the technology and weapons systems. The first of six C-130J military transport aircraft will be delivered in December, on time and on budget. We hope to finalise the sale of C-17 transport aircraft in the next few months and two US companies have made strong bids for the medium multi-role combat aircraft tender. Selecting either of these companies would be a very strong signal of Indias commitment to our global military partnership.\u000a\u000aA vitally important aspect to this building relationship entails helping people and responding to natural disasters. Earthquakes, tsunamis and floods will occur in this region, maybe with more frequency. Whether the scenario involves humanitarian assistance, counterterrorism cooperation, or maritime security activities, having common equipment will allow more seamless cooperation.\u000a\u000aRecognising the importance of seamless cooperation, the Obama Administration has made export control reform a key priority as we see streamlining and modernising our export control system as a national security issue. This directly affects our ability to build effective partnerships with partners such as India.\u000a\u000aAlong similar lines, we encourage India to sign the agreements that are vital to develop the full potential for the US to transfer the most sophisticated technology in the world. This enables joint research and development, technology collaboration and increased US investment, and is necessary for India to benefit fully from our most sensitive military equipment and highly sophisticated encryption technology.\u000a\u000aHistory has shown that global problems and challenges can only be overcome by collective action. World War II was won by countries from North and South America, Europe, and Asia working together. The Cold War was won through the collective efforts of the US, Western Europe and many other countries. Current and future global problems and challenges can only be solved in a similar manner. Partnering with India, the global commons can be safer. By expanding our already robust cooperation in air, space, cyberspace and maritime initiatives, the region can be a more prosperous and peaceful place.\u000a\u000aAs President Obama told the recent graduating class at West Point, The burdens of this century cannot fall on American shoulders alone. In the past, weve always had the foresight to avoid acting alone. A secure and peaceful world requires partners with common security interests that are willing and able to partner with us. We are building that partnership.\u000a\u000aThe author is the US Ambassador to India

As bigger players hog the limelight, smaller nations with mountainous regions are feeling sidelined.\u000a\u000aWith two months to go for the COP 16 climate change conference in Cancun, Mexico, Nepal has launched an initiative to \u2018introduce\u2019 the mountain agenda into the UNFCCC negotiation process.\u000a\u000aLast week experts from 17 mountain nations across the globe gathered at Kathmandu to prepare a common platform and chalk out an agenda to protect mountains from affects of climate change.\u000a\u000aMountains host 13 per cent populations and are source of all major rivers. But as the polar ice caps melt, they too are threatened. Mountain communities who have contributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions would be the worst affected as it would change their lifestyles and force them to move elsewhere.\u000a\u000aBut it would have far bigger impact in the lowlands too with increasing landslides, floods and other natural disasters, rapid melting of glaciers and degradation of watersheds threatening millions.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut issues related to mountains are not getting due focus in international conferences. Hence such an initiative was needed to draw attention of global community,\u201d says Ganesh Joshi, Secretary (environment), Nepal government.\u000a\u000aWith assistance of groups like International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development the initiative hopes to play a bigger role in Cancun and beyond.\u000a\u000aTo take the initiative forward, ministers from mountainous nations will deliberate in Kathmandu next spring to put pressure on bigger players. How they respond to this call to address the emerging threat to hills will be witnessed at Cancun.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aLevels of dissolved oxygen in the tropical oceans are dropping at a rate that threatens the survival of fish and other marine organisms. This reduction is seen off the coast as well as further away from the land where the water-depth exceeds 1,500 metres. The \u2018dead zones' off the coast are primarily the result of booms in phytoplankton growth due to nitrogen-rich fertilizers leaking from agricultural lands. If the incidence of hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) has risen ten-fold globally in the past 50 years, the jump is nearly 30-fold in the case of the United States' coastal waters. The Pacific coast has witnessed a six-fold increase in the number of hypoxic sites in the last 20 years. A recent study (\u201cScientific assessment of hypoxia in U.S. coastal waters\u201d) by key U.S. federal agencies reveals that nearly half of the 650 waterways covered are experiencing hypoxic conditions. Particularly worrying is the reconfirmation of hypoxic condition in the waters off Oregon and Washington, the second largest hypoxic region in the U.S. and the third largest in the world. The inner continental-shelf waters off Oregon, which exhibit hypoxic conditions only during summer, have no nutrient supply. Climate change may be the cause, as warming reduces solubility of oxygen, thereby affecting the mixing of warmer surface water with deeper oxygen-deficient water. But a definite link cannot be established in the absence of long-time oxygen measurements. A news item published in Nature last month has it that water at 50 metres depth off the Oregon coast was turning hypoxic as water above the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is \u201csteadily losing oxygen.\u201d The OMZ, which is permanently oxygen-deprived and occurs naturally at a depth 600-1,200 metres, is slowly expanding vertically and extending towards the coast.\u000a\u000aThe outcome in both dead zones \u2014 one caused by pollution and the other by hypoxic water, probably due to climate change \u2014 is a large-scale migration of fishes and other free-swimming marine organisms, and the death of bottom dwellers like crabs and starfish. Fish-kills happen when oxygen levels drop suddenly as reported in Oregon during certain years. Fish-kills or large-scale migration of fish can have enormous economic and ecological consequences. Since the effects of climate change cannot be reversed even in the mid-term, marine organisms can be saved only through immediate and drastic action to reduce the quantum of fertilizer leaking into the oceans. Strategies to reduce nutrient loading have proved successful in reducing the level of hypoxia in the Long Island Sound estuary, for instance.

a((VIndia expects to put in place in five years a system of green national accounting that would take into account the environmental costs of development and reflect the use of precious depletable natural resources in the process of generating national income.\u000a\u000a"In the last few months, I have tried to set the ball rolling so that by 2015 at least we can have a system of green national accounting," Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh said here.\u000a\u000aHe was delivering the 11th ISRO-JNCASR Satish Dhawan Memorial Lecture on "The two cultures revisited: Some reflections on the environment-development debate in India" at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research.\u000a\u000aRamesh noted that India currently does not have "green accounting".\u000a\u000aEconomists estimate gross domestic product (GDP) as a broad measure of national income, while net domestic product (NDP) accounts for the use of physical capital.\u000a\u000a"But as yet, we have no generally accepted system to convert gross domestic product into green domestic product that would reflect the use up of precious depletable natural resources in the process of generating national income", he said.\u000a\u000aEconomists all over the world have been at work for quite some time on developing a robust system of green national accounting but "we are not there as yet".\u000a\u000a"Ideally, if we can report both gross domestic product and green domestic product, we will get a better picture of the trade-offs involved in the process of economic growth", the Minister added.

a((Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIf national targets are not revised in the Copenhagen Accord, the international pledge which was agreed at last year's Copenhagen's COP15 climate change conference, a global temperature increase of up to 4.2º C and the end of coral reefs could become reality by 2100.\u000a\u000aJust ahead of the next United Nations Climate Change Conference, which starts on 4 October in Tianjin, China, a new report published yesterday (September 29), in Environmental Research Letters describes how, due to lack of global action to date, only a small chance remains for keeping the global temperature increase down to 2º C, the Accord's target.\u000a\u000aLooking at individual countries' agreed targets for emission levels, the report shows that many developed countries such as the USA and the European Union have set their aims very low, aiming at reaching emission levels just a few percent lower than 1990 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aJapan and Norway are aiming to drastically reduce their emission to 25 per cent and 30 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels respectively.\u000a\u000aPresenting their results in Environmental Research Letters, the researchers have found that even if nations would agree to a 50 per cent reduction of emission levels by 2050 there would still only be a less than 50 per cent chance to keep global warming below 2º C.\u000a\u000aRising global temperature levels would not be the only consequence of failing to raise the ambition level of future global emission reductions. Increasing ocean acidification could lead to a rapid decline of coral reefs and the marine ecosystem in the 21st century.\u000a\u000aUrgent action is necessary, the authors write. \u201cIt is clear from this analysis that higher ambitions for 2020 are necessary to keep the options for 2º C and 1.5º C open without relying on potentially infeasible reduction rates after 2020.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn addition, the absence of a mid-century emission goal \u2014 towards which Parties as a whole can work and which serve as a yardstick of whether interim reductions by 2020 and 2030 are on the right track \u2014 is a critical deficit in the Copenhagen Accord.\u201d \u2014 Our Bureau
