VOver the last three years, with its economy in tatters, Ireland embraced a novel strategy to help reduce its staggering deficit: charging households and businesses for the environmental damage they cause.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe government imposed taxes on most of the fossil fuels used by homes, offices, vehicles and farms, based on each fuel\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions, a move that immediately drove up prices for oil, natural gas and kerosene.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHousehold trash is weighed at the curb, and residents are billed for anything that is not being recycled.The Irish now pay purchase taxes on new cars and yearly registration fees that rise steeply in proportion to the vehicle\u2019s emissions. Environmentally and economically, the new taxes have delivered results. Long one of Europe\u2019s highest per-capita producers of greenhouse gases, with levels nearing those of the United States, Ireland has seen its emissions drop more than 15 per cent since 2008.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAlthough much of that decline can be attributed to a recession, changes in behaviour also played a major role, experts say, noting that the country\u2019s emissions dropped 6.7 per cent in 2011 even as the economy grew slightly.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not saints like those Scandinavians \u2013 we were lapping up fossil fuels, buying bigger cars and homes, very American,\u201d said Eamon Ryan, who served as Ireland\u2019s energy minister from 2007 to 2011. \u201cWe just set up a price signal that raised significant revenue and changed behaviour.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, we\u2019re smashing through the environmental targets we set for ourselves.\u201d By contrast, carbon taxes are viewed as politically toxic in the US. Republican leaders in Congress have pledged to block any proposal for such a tax and president Barack Obama has not advocated one, although the idea has drawn support from economists of varying ideologies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnvironmental taxes\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYet when the Irish were faced with new environmental taxes, they quickly shifted to greener fuels and cars and began recycling with fervour. Automakers like Mercedes found ways to make powerful cars with an emissions rating as low as tinier Nissans. With less trash, landfills closed. And as fossil fuels became more costly, renewable energy sources became more competitive allowing Ireland\u2019s wind power industry to thrive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe three-year-old carbon tax has raised nearly 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) overall, including 400 million euros in 2012. That provided the Irish government with 25 per cent of the 1.6 billion euros in new tax revenue it needed to narrow its budget gap this year and avert a rise in income tax rates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe International Monetary Fund, which oversees the rescue plan, recently suggested that Ireland should \u2018expand the well-designed carbon tax\u2019 and its automobile taxes to generate even more money.Although first proposed by the Green Party, the environmental taxes enjoy the support of all major political parties \u201cbecause it puts a lot of money on the table,\u201d said Frank Convery, an economist at University College Dublin. The bailout plan for 2013 requires Ireland to embrace a mix of new tax revenues and spending cuts.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNot everyone is happy. The prices of basic commodities like gasoline and heating oil have risen 5 to 10 per cent. This is particularly hard on the poor, although the government has provided subsidies for low-income families to better insulate homes, for example.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrices just keep going up, and a lot of people think it\u2019s a scam,\u201d said Imelda Lyons, 45, as she filled her car at a gas station here.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cYou call it a carbon tax, but what good is being done with it to help the environment?\u201d The coalition government that enacted the taxes was voted out of office last year. \u201cJust imagine President Obama saying in the debate, \u2018I\u2019ve got this great idea, but it\u2019s going to increase your gasoline price,\u201d' said Ryan, who lost his seat in the last election and now leads the Green Party. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t exactly cheer us on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAlthough carbon taxes in some ways disproportionately affect the poor \u2013 who are less able to buy new, more efficient cars, for example \u2013 such taxes do heavily penalise the wealthy, who consume far more. As with \u201csin taxes\u201d on cigarettes, the taxes also alleviate some of the societal costs of pollution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor several years, the European Commission has encouraged debt-ridden members of the European Union to embrace environmental taxes, saying that its economists have concluded they have \u201ca less detrimental macroeconomic impact\u201d than new income taxes or corporate taxes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe environmental taxes work in concert with austerity measures like reduced welfare payments and higher fees for health care that are expected to save 2.2 billion euros this year. The carbon tax is levied on fossil fuels when they enter the country and is then passed on to consumers at the point of purchase.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe automobile sales tax, which ranges from 14 to 36 per cent of a car\u2019s market price depending on its emissions, is simply folded into the sticker price.\u000a\u000a

V\u201c\u2026frustration is a renewable resource, but frustration does not reduce emissions\u201d, remarked a wistful Connie Hedegaard, EU\u2019s Commissioner for Climate Action, while summing up the outcome of the UN climate change conference held in Doha a month ago.\u000a\u000aHer frustration, however, was not shared by the Executive Director of the Climate Secretariat, Christiana Figuerres, who claimed the talks were a success. That neither of the two perceptions was wholly correct would be the conclusion of those following the course of the negotiations.\u000a\u000aTo dismiss Doha as sterile in results would be passing a harsh judgment. Let\u2019s look at the brighter side first. For starters, a major gain was the acceptance of the developed countries to enter into a second commitment period for reduction of emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) starting from 2013 and ending in 2020.\u000a\u000aThe aim of many of the developed countries was for COP18 to give a clean burial to the Protocol and instead await the adoption of a new global compact that would rope in the BASIC. The new agreement on which work is supposed to be completed by 2015 would take effect from 2020, and with its adoption the Kyoto Protocol would come to a natural end.\u000a\u000aGAINS FROM MEET\u000a\u000aTherefore, the game plan of the developed countries was to make the Protocol inoperative by not extending it over a second commitment period starting from 2013, and thus avoid any further obligation to reduce their emission of GHGs till 2020.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries, particularly India and China, had put much insistence on the continuation of the Protocol and made this a condition precedent to their acceptance of emission intensity reductions and entering into a common global compact.\u000a\u000aWith this divergence between the developed and developing countries, a big gap of eight years starting from 2013 (during which the world will have to do without any fetters being put on anyone on their releases of GHS and thereby resulting in greater global warming stood) out as a distinct possibility.\u000a\u000aTherefore, the agreement at Doha to extend the Kyoto Protocol over a second commitment period for eight years was not an insignificant gain, either to the developing countries or to the Climate Secretariat or to the hosts of the meet or to global climate security.\u000a\u000aCARBON CREDIT FARCE\u000a\u000aThe second gain for the existing climate change regime was over the issue of continuing the validity of carbon credits (called Assigned Amount Units or AAUs) that had accrued to the Russian Federation and other countries of Eastern Europe under the Kyoto Protocol. The accrual of this huge cache of credits resulted from the closure of a large number of state-owned industrial enterprises in the former command economies, and not through any special efforts on their part to reduce their GHG emissions.\u000a\u000aThis whopping asset of almost 13 billion carbon credits that could be transferred to any other country governed by Kyoto Protocol to reduce the latter\u2019s emission reduction obligations for a monetary consideration was sought to be carried over to the Second Commitment Period by Russia and other countries of eastern Europe, notably Poland.\u000a\u000aThis sale of \u201chot air\u201d would have helped the transferor to earn money and at the same time helped the transferee to meet any reduction obligations under the second commitment without much domestic effort. Worse, the transaction would have negated any gains the Protocol sought to achieve in the second period.\u000a\u000aAs things turned out, in the decision taken at Doha, only a part of these credits was allowed to be carried over to the second period. Thus an issue that had the potential of wrecking the Conference was sorted out successfully.\u000a\u000aFINANCIAL MECHANISM\u000a\u000aThe third and perhaps an important gain for India was the renewed commitment by developed countries to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, which would provide financial assistance to the developing countries to meet the costs of implementing their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Similarly, a strong commitment was expressed to facilitate transfer of mitigation and adaptation related technologies to developing countries, which addresses the issue of Intellectual Property Rights that often come in the way of such transfers.\u000a\u000aWith such gains, why should there be gloom over the climate scene? First and foremost, one senses a diminishing ardour for serious action on the part of developed countries to reduce their GHG emissions. Barring the EU, there is little sign of others taking the warnings of climate scientists seriously. According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Scientists on Climate Change, the average global temperature would surely go up by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050 compared to pre-industrial days with the present levels of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in the atmosphere. A recent World Bank report warns of a 4 degree rise. The reluctance of developed countries, barring the EU, to reduce their emissions is therefore a cause for worry.\u000a\u000aWithout the US pulling its weight, no global agreement would be of much effect. Others like Canada, which have exited the Kyoto Protocol, and Russia, Japan, New Zealand and Ukraine that have come out openly against the Protocol, need to be brought back into the fold.\u000a\u000aWith the continuing sluggishness in the global economy, the danger of emergence of protectionism in the form of environmental barriers to trade masquerading as affirmative climate action is a real possibility.\u000a\u000aFor example, the competitiveness of energy intensive industries like steel, cement, metals and glass is sharply in the sights of US law makers who would like to throw a protective wall around them by imposing levies on imports from, say, China and India. EU has already introduced an aviation tax on airlines operating in European skies.\u000a\u000aLastly, if the past is any indication, the next three years that would be spent in shaping a new global compact on climate control, encompassing both developed and developing countries, promise to be rough and stormy. This would call for a nuanced approach, as Jairam Ramesh would put it, on everyone\u2019s part in the negotiations.\u000a\u000a(The author is former Secretary, Union Ministry of Environment and Forests.)

VSouth Asian countries need to cooperate more with each other to make meaningful improvement on shared issues related to climate change and resource scarcity, a report released by a US-based think tank has said.\u000a\u000aThe report, titled \u201cEcological Cooperation in South Asia: A Way Forward\u201d, highlights lack of cooperation between South Asian nations which continues to hamper efforts to create meaningful partnerships on environmental problems.\u000a\u000aWritten by Saleem H Ali, a professor at the University of Vermont and University of Queensland in Australia, the report say the most consequential ecological features in South Asia are the Himalayas and their rivers, and this is where some of the worst territorial disputes in the region take place.\u000a\u000aDifficult visa process, which often discriminates against individuals of a different regional nationality, along with many other factors, have forced partnerships on environmental concerns to rely on foreign donors, it says.\u000a\u000aCollaborating on environmental issues, such as finding more efficient means of water and energy usage, is a mutually beneficial opportunity for countries to build trust and peace, it says.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ecological cooperation from such regionalism has the potential for building trust to resolve long-standing territorial disputes, especially between India and Pakistan,\u201d the report says.\u000a\u000aIt notes that SAARC remains the most promising forum for deepening relationships between the experts and officials working on environmental issues in South Asia countries.\u000a\u000aThe Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan has served an important purpose of preventing riparian conflict, and it should maintain this role with additional regional technology transfer and integrated water management functions to reduce inefficiencies, the report recommends.\u000a\u000aAmong other things, the report suggests that cooperative programmes by international donors should strengthen their focus on mountain ecosystems, given their prominent environmental vulnerability as well as their importance in defining territorial borders.\u000a\u000aObserving that a gradual shift from bilateralism to multilateralism is essential for the ecologically sustainable development of South Asia, the report says such a shift should be instrumental used for peace-building through diplomatic measures.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aElectric vehicles offer a spectre of hope amid escalating fuel price, but they are yet to make waves in the automobile sector in Kerala. Buyers of electric vehicles form a miniscule minority among car users in the State.\u000a\u000aWhile cars running on petroleum fuel are being launched frequently to cater to the demand, the scene on the electric vehicle segment is disappointing due to the poor patronage from vehicle users. On an average, only four cars per month were sold in Kerala last year by the Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Private Limited, the only company selling electric vehicles in the State. This is in contrast to the growth story of the companies selling vehicles running on fossil fuel in Kerala.\u000a\u000aThe number of Maruti vehicles sold in Kerala registered a 13 per cent growth during the nine-month period ending December last year. On an average, more than 8,000 Maruti cars were sold every month in the State. There are several other manufacturers offering a variety of automobiles and most of them have registered remarkable growth.\u000a\u000aWhile several individuals buy the electric vehicle as an additional car, certain campuses and institutions offer patronage as a means to promote clean technologies. Government departments, which have a stake in preservation of environment, have not bothered to look at the electric vehicle alternative for transport.\u000a\u000aThe scene could change with the new vehicle from the Mahindra Reva stable, e2O, set to be launched across the country shortly. Though no announcement on the launch of the new vehicle has been made in Kerala, its launch is expected to set the ball rolling for a renewed EV market in the State. Several other manufactures are also waiting in the wings to launch hybrid varieties that could almost match the cars running on petrol and diesel.\u000a\u000aThe new vehicle will make use of the lithium ion batteries, providing improved efficiency in charging and retaining the charge for longer hours. The car will have a range of 100 km per charge. The vehicle will enable users to charge the vehicle through any 5 ampere plug point at home or at the workplace. The driving cost of the vehicle would be Rs.0.44 per km in contrast to over Rs.4 for the car running on petrol, according to company sources.\u000a\u000aSources in the industry told The Hindu that the government is expected to relax road tax for the electric vehicle on account of the savings on import of gasoline as well as zero emission advantage. A few states have already taken steps in that direction.

VAHMEDABAD: The masses are waking up to the challenges posed by changing ecology and are now ready to pay more for green energy This fact has been highlighted by a study conducted by the city-based Vikram Sarabhai Center for Development Interaction ( VIKSAT ) and Jaipur-based CUTS International a year ago.The same group was called for a discussion on the survey's findings on Tuesday at VIKSAT, located at Center for Environmental Education ( CEE ) campus. Ankur Baruah of VIKSAT, who was part of the survey, told TOI that they had included households, farmers, industries, commercial units, government institutions and civil society organizations (CSOs) from Ahmedabad, Kutch, Mehsana and Patan. The participants were asked whether they were aware of the renewable energy technology products, whether they were ready to pay more for such energy, whether they use such products, whether they would invest in it for the future and whether they were aware of energy commission."Over the last year, we have seen a change in public perception about renewable energy in the wake of several factors including fuel price hike. Earlier, 36 per cent were ready to pay more but in the final survey, the number rose to 84 per cent. Compared to 57 per cent respondents who were aware about the energy savers, 85 per cent got the information in the interim period. We also found that 60 per cent of the respondents were using fuel-efficient products. Interestingly, we found that the consumers were particular when it came to buying refrigerator as it is one appliance that runs round the clock," said Baruah.

The second phase of the study revealed normal monsoon would be on the decrease as during the last monsoon, but was not clear and sure on the time and mode of droughts and floods, which have to be further investigated, Annamalai said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTNAU vice-chancellor Dr K Ramasamy said the three year Rs 7 crore project aimed at sustaining rice production under changing climate in the Cauvery River Basin modelled it for future change in climate, hydrology and rice productivity.In addition, various adaptation and mitigation measures, including water and nutrient management and microbial technologies to minimise methane emission from rice fields were also developed for dissemination, he said.

VIn the most comprehensive review of changes to extreme rainfall ever undertaken, researchers from the University of Adelaide, evaluated the association between extreme rainfall and atmospheric temperatures at more than 8000 weather gauging stations around the world, the telegraph reported.\u000a\u000a"The results are that rainfall extremes are increasing on average globally. They show that there is a 7 percent increase in extreme rainfall intensity for every degree increase in global atmospheric temperature," lead author Dr Seth Westra said.\u000a\u000a"Assuming an increase in global average temperature by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century, this could mean very substantial increases in rainfall intensity as a result of climate change," he said.\u000a\u000aDr Westra, a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide's School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering and member of the Environment Institute, said trends in rainfall extremes were examined over the period from 1900 to 2009 to determine whether they were becoming more intense or occurring more frequently.\u000a\u000a"The results show that rainfall extremes were increasing over this period, and appear to be linked to the increase in global temperature of nearly a degree which also took place over this time.\u000a\u000a"If extreme rainfall events continue to intensify, we can expect to see floods occurring more frequently around the world." Dr Westra added.\u000a\u000aThe strongest increases occurred in the tropical countries, although some level of increase seems to be taking place at the majority of weather gauging stations.\u000a\u000a"Most of these tropical countries are very poor and thus not well placed to adapt to the increased risk of flooding, which puts them in a larger threat of devastation," he said.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Scientists predict ice-free Arctic by 2058\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VPUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will introduce a new green building rating system wherein a building constructed on plot area below 2,500 sq.m. can obtain the rating.\u000a\u000aThe standing committee has approved a resolution to start the system. The resolution stated that the civic body had started the system of green rating for integrated habitat assessment (GRIHA) in the municipal limits to promote construction of green buildings on plots which have an area of more than 2,500 sqm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe buildings get one to five stars as per the points earned. The buildings get concession in premium charges which is 10 times the number of stars obtained in rating system. The three, four and five star rating buildings get five, eight and ten percent concession in general tax, a component of the property tax.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ministry of new and renewable energy and The Energy and Resource Institute have developed a new green building rating system for constructions on plot having area of less than 2,500 sqm called 'SVA GRIHA'. It was launched on March 1, 2012.The buildings get one to five stars as per the points earned. The buildings get concession in premium charges which is 10 times the number of stars obtained in rating system. One, two, three, four and five star rating buildings get five, eight, 10, 12 and 15 percent concession in general tax.The resolution will be sent to the civic general body for final approval.A civic official said that the green building rating system has been started in the city to promote the builders to construct environment friendly buildings. The builders have to apply to GRIHA- national level rating agency for getting the rating right from the design stage of the project. They need to inform the civic body too. Later the builder who has received the green building rating system approaches the civic body to get the concession depending on the rating he has received.The builders or individuals who want to obtain the SVA GRIHA rating must follow the same process.

VMoscow, Feb 16 (AFP) The president of the World Bank today warned the finance chiefs of the world's leading economic powers that global warming is a real risk to the planet and already affecting the world economy in unprecedented ways. Addressing the G20 finance ministers at their meeting in Moscow, Jim Yong Kim called on the world powers to "tackle the serious challenges presented by climate change." "These are not just risks. They represent real consequences," said Kim, calling the lack of attention to the issue by finance ministers and central bank chiefs "a mistake". He said failing to tackle the challenges of climate change risked having "serious consequences for the economic outlook". "Damages and losses from natural disasters have more than tripled over the past 30 years," said Kim, giving as examples the USD 45 billion of losses from the 2011 floods in Thailand, whose effects "spread across borders disrupting international supply chains. "Years of development efforts are often wiped out in days or even minutes," Kim said, asking the G20 to "face climate change, which is a very real and present danger." The G20 finance ministers' agenda in Moscow is dominated by concerns about competitive currency devaluations and a new drive by EU powers to force big business to pay a fair share of tax.

VThe BASIC Group Meeting, formed by Brazil, South Africa, India and China, has reiterated the need for a roadmap to raise funds for green climate and urged the developed countries to contribute their share to the funding of $30 billion that they have already agreed.\u000a\u000aThe fund should have a corpus of around $30 billion, and the developed countries have already committed to provide the fund combined as fast-start funding for the project. However the fund currently has only around $7 billion, said the officials after the Group meeting, concluded today in Chennai.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to the reporters after the meeting of BASIC Environment Ministers on Climate Change, Jayanthi Natarajan, Union Minister for State (Independent Charge) for the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, said, "The meeting stressed that there should be clear roadmap to raise finance (short- and long-term). The capitalisation of fund is important."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe meeting also looked at how the fund could be raised to finance the project, which could be from public and private resources, though a majority of it should come from public fund.\u000a\u000aThe Group also urged the developed countries to increase their level of mitigation ambition, noting that currently the level is not adequate to achieve major results. It may be noted that while the Durban outcome under the has set goal to bring down emissions in developed countries by 25-40 per cent below the emission levels of 1990, which has to be achieved by the year 2020, the current commitments for reduction of emission are not up to the required mark.\u000a\u000aWhile the Durban outcome under the notes the goal for reducing emissions in developed countries by 25-40% below 1990 levels by 2020,2 unfortunately Parties\u2019 current emissions reduction commitments fall very short of this range. Durban decisions have \u201curged\u201d an increase in ambition on the part of developed countries.\u000a\u000aThe ministry has earlier announced that the important issues that would be discussed in the BASIC Ministers meeting include principles under the Durban Platform, the role and relevance of independent international initiatives including sectoral actions in promotion and achievement of global ambition, and the steps needed to ensure means of implementation to parties for enhancing their efforts.\u000a\u000aVarious international groups of nations, like the G77 could togather urge the developed nations to bring down their emissions, said Natarajan.\u000a\u000aFunding is very important to achieve the goals set for the project and the nations has to look at various options of funding, said Xie Zhenhua, vice chairman, National Development and Reform Commission, China.\u000a\u000aThe plans are to collect fund from various sources and channel it through the Green Climate Fund, said Alfred Wills, chief negotiator, Department of Environmental Affairs, South Africa.\u000a\u000aThe deliberations in the 14th BASIC meeting held for two days, February 15 and 16 in Chennai, is also expected to help India and other BASIC countries in formulating their approach to future issues in the negotiations and plan help build ambitious and equitable architecture for post 2020 arrangements. India, along with the like-minded developing countries, are also expected to meet in Geneva on 27-28 February, 2013 to review the decisions at Doha and plan the future steps.

While the UN convention already has a market oriented scheme to cut carbon emissions, a new market mechanism is to be created in coming years.The four countries came to a conclusion that such a mechanism was bound to fail unless the developed countries showed greater ambition to reduce their emissions \u2013 something they did not show keenness to at the last annual climate meet at Doha in November 2012.The negotiators from the four countries also decided that they would push strongly to remind the developed world that the new climate deal to be signed by 2015 must be framed within the provisions of the existing UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and should not attempt to bypass or overrule its principles. \u201cAll four BASIC countries are clear that the new agreement is only to enhance action under the existing convention and not to create a new regime,\u201d a senior Indian Negotiator attending the meeting told TOI.The meeting of the negotiators is to be followed up with another round of talks between the four ministers on Saturday, at the end of which the BASIC group is expected to come out with a communiqu to put forth a joint position on the climate negotiations.The meeting of the BASIC group comes at a critical time when the 190 plus countries members to the UN climate convention are set to forge a new global deal to cut emissions in which the rich countries want the emerging economies to take on yet more obligations. The US and other developed countries, in the Doha round of talks, had pushed hard to remove any reference to the existing principles of the climate convention while formulating this new global compact.The four countries also discussed countering the push from the rich world to cut the short-lived greenhouse gases first and look for solutions to the long-lasting carbon emissions much later \u2013 an option that benefits the developed world.

VNEW DELHI: A sum of Rs 230,000 crore would be required to meet the targets under the National Action Place on Climate Change , the Economic Survey for 2012-13 has noted, adding that additional steps suggested under the 12th Five Year Plan and other environmental initiatives would require yet more resources.The report warns that though the government will need to deploy public funds to meet the needs of the 8 missions under the action plan, the global community \u2013 the developed countries especially \u2013 have failed to so far cough up or commit adequate finances to meet the challenge for the world to fight off climate change and help developing countries achieve sustainable development.Interestingly the survey report also makes an indirect critique of the discussions on financing \u2018inclusive green growth\u2019 at the G20 forum. At the group meetings India has too often found rich countries pushing for private financing of the war against climate change instead of securing public finance. It notes that the group has \u2018stark disparities in terms of incomes, stages of development as well as respective per capita emissions of carbon dioxide.\u201dThe chapter warns that countries would find private investments would only be attracted to the market for lucrative green technologies but would be missing from critical areas like adaptation to climate change, which are a priority for poor countries.It notes that UN confabulations suggest funds in the range of US $ 600-1,500 billion a year would be required to match the needs of developing countries to fight climate change.For mustering and focusing domestic resources to the extent possible the survey suggests a mix of economic tools, incentives as well as regulatory regimes in coming years after careful evaluation.The report says, \u201cConsidering the large resource requirement arguments in favour of setting up a National Green Fund to finance public and private sector projects aimed at protecting environment in the 12th Five Year Plan objectives have found support.\u201d The survey says the fund could also become the medium to route international finance through.

VWarning that a carbon tax of $10 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions could cause a GDP loss of more than $600 billion, the Economic Survey says the way forward for domestic environment financing must come from a mix of market mechanisms, fiscal instruments and regulatory interventions.\u000a\u000aCiting the results of preliminary modelling studies by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the Survey argues that \u201crelying solely on carbon taxes and subsidy may not be the most viable policy option.\u201d It also discusses the establishment of a National Green Fund to finance environmental protection, but only mentions international sources to fill the coffers of the Fund.\u000a\u000aThe models projected four different carbon tax scenarios for a 20-year period between 2010-11 and 2030-31. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, an economy-wide tax on carbon emissions at the rate of $80 per tonne would lead to an undiscounted cumulative GDP loss of more than $4 trillion. But even a modest revenue-neutral $10 per tonne tax would lead to losses of $632 billion at 2005 prices, said the studies.\u000a\u000a(However, it is worth noting that when these studies were originally done, at least one economist cautioned that they had not taken into account structural changes and adjustments over the two decade period, thus leading to exaggerated projections of loss.)\u000a\u000aWhile it is difficult to assess the actual costs of fighting climate change \u2013 both through mitigation and adaptation \u2013 the Survey points to the preliminary estimate of Rs. 2.3 lakh crore needed to achieve the National Action Plan on Climate Change\u2019s objectives.\u000a\u000aWhere is the money going to come from? Apart from government expenditure and subsidiaries \u2013 which were estimated at more than Rs. 5,000 crore for 2008-09 \u2013 taxes are an obvious option. And the Survey acknowledges that \u201ctheoretically, environment-related taxes have an important role to play in funding green initiatives.\u201d And, of course, the Rs. 50 per tonne cess on coal is a form of carbon tax.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Survey then goes on to cite the scary GDP losses projected by the modelling studies, warning that \u201cat the same time, any government must use these policy tools after serious consideration and analysis as they may have serious repercussions on other sectors of the economy.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile cap and trade mechanisms are also being used to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, the Survey makes it clear that domestic resources are simply not enough.\u000a\u000aThus, the proposed National Green Fund, which could be set up to finance both public and private sector activities aimed at protecting the environment, has no specified domestic sources of funding. Instead, the Survey only notes that \u201cthe Fund could also be a vehicle for receiving international support.\u201d

VShares of ArcelorMittal South Africa dropped more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after the government said it would tax carbon emissions from 2015, sparking concern heavy polluters could see their earnings hit. As the continent's top greenhouse gas emitter, South Africa is looking to curb emissions, although it also plans some exemptions to protect industry, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said during his 2013 budget speech. ArcelorMittal South Africa, a unit of the world's biggest steelmaker and one of the biggest polluters in the country, finished down 6.1 per cent at 28.83 ...

VPromising new initiatives in the field of green energy, Union New and Renewable Energy Minister Farooq Abdullah today expressed hope that the Budget proposals will allow his ministry to ensure that electricity reaches people who do not have access to it till now.\u000a\u000a"I am happy with the Budget. We have got sufficient fund and they have promised to give more help once we are done with the complete utilisation of the given money," Farooq said.\u000a\u000aHe was addressing around 150 students from who him at his residence here under a youth exchange programme 'Watan Ko Jano.'\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFarooq said "this year we are going to take new initiatives related to our ministry which we are planning to make public very soon so that people who do not have access to the electricity may get it".\u000a\u000aFinance Minister had during his budget speech on Thursday termed as priority the promotion of clean and green energy. He announced schemes for making renewable energy cheaper by providing for low interest bearing funds and to encourage cities and municipalities to set up waste-to-energy projects in PPP mode.\u000a\u000aAbout 150 students have come here from especially from militancy hit areas as part of the programme organised by the State Rehabilitation Council of The students have visited several places in northern India.\u000a\u000a"Students' visit here was an important one which will help us to connect with them. I want these students to go for renewable energy. These students have so many people. This programme is an excellent initiative and we should take this forward," the Minister said.\u000a\u000a"We have been to places like Chandigarh, Amritsar and others so that these young kids should know about their country, its food, its language and people. We had received very good response from our last year programme," Hafiza Muzaffar, Director of State Rehabilitation Council, said.\u000a\u000a"Initially the students were scared. We took the initiative to give exposure to these young students who got themselves registered at the district offices and from there they got selected for this programme," she said.

V: Close on the heels of the Union finance minister ruing the burgeoning cost of energy imports while presenting the Budget in the\u000a\u000aon Thursday, the\u000a\u000aDevelopment Authority (\u000a\u000a) is planning to make it mandatory for buildings beyond a particular size to install their own solar power plant.\u000a\u000aBHUBANESWARLokSabhaBhubaneswarBDAThe BDA, which has been currently in the process of amending the BDA (planning and building standards) regulations 2008, is planning to make it compulsory for buildings of minimum 300 sq metre and beyond to install 500 Watt solar power plants.The buildings will be able to sell surplus solar energy to the national grid, according to the BDA plan. "Technology to generate solar energy has become very cost effective. Making changes in regulations will boost dependence on the clean source of energy," housing and urban development secretary Injeti Srinivas told TOI.Apart from houses for which solar plants would be compulsory, others opting for solar energy will get certain incentives from the government, said sources. As per a proposal, houses with solar plants will have two meters for the solar energy: One for measuring their use and the other for the energy they will divert to the national grid. The government will involve a private party for technological support. "Such a model of selling extra energy to the grid exists in Ahmedabad. The government is exploring to replicate the same in the city," said town planning director P K Patnaik. Hotels and hospitals will also be encouraged to depend on green sources for at least part of their energy needs.Realtors have welcomed the government move. "It is a good green energy initiative. Along with it, the government should give incentives to buildings for plantations, environment-friendly waste disposal system and water harvesting," said D S Tripathy, state president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.As of now, the secretariat building has a rooftop photovoltaic power plant. The Odisha Renewable Energy Development Agency (OREDA), the government agency popularizing use of non-conventional energy, has installed the solar panels. The 50 kilo watt plant has been directly connected to the secretariat grid.Around the city, two solar power plants of 1 MW each in Barang and Tangi, financed by S N Mohanty Group and MGM Minerals, are under various stages of completion. These two projects were approved under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) to generate grid quality power.Under a separate programme, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been preparing a master plan for implementation of the Union government-sponsored solar city project for which the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) had selected the state capital among 50 cities across the country. Under the project, the civic body is supposed to find out ways to reduce at least 10% of the projected demand of conventional energy through renewable energy.

VArguing that the country is finally poised to take control of its energy future, US President Barack Obama asked the Congress to use revenues from oil-and-gas production to wean cars and trucks from oil, breaking the cycle of gasoline price spikes once and for all.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only way to really break this cycle of spiking gas prices, the only way to break that cycle for good is to shift our cars and trucks entirely off oil,\u201d Obama said yesterday in his remarks on energy after visiting the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.\u000a\u000aThe US, he said, is finally poised to take control of its energy future.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe produce more oil than we have in 15 years. We import less oil than we have in 20 years. We\u2019ve doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar \u2014 with tens of thousands of good jobs to show for it,\u201d he said, adding that the US is producing more natural gas than we ever before.\u000a\u000aObama said a new report issued yesterday shows the US is becoming a global leader in advanced vehicles.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou walk into any dealership today, and you\u2019ll see twice as many hybrids to choose from as there were five years ago.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ll see seven times as many cars that can go 40 miles a gallon or more. And as costs go down, sales are going up,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cLast year, General Motors sold more hybrid vehicles than ever before. Ford is selling some of the most fuel-efficient cars so quickly that dealers are having a tough time keeping up with the demand. So by investing in our energy security, we\u2019re helping our businesses succeed and we\u2019re creating good middle-class jobs right here in America,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aObama announced the creation of \u2018Energy Security Trust\u2019 to drive research in this area, which he said, would free families and businesses from painful spikes in gas once and for all.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s set up an Energy Security Trust that helps us free our families and our businesses from painful spikes in gas once and for all. Let\u2019s do that. We can do it. We\u2019ve done it before,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019ll keep moving on the all-of-the-above energy strategy that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple years, where we\u2019re producing more oil and gas here at home but we\u2019re also producing more biofuels, we\u2019re also producing more fuel-efficient vehicles; more solar power; more wind power.\u000a\u000a\u201c...We\u2019re working to make sure that here in America we\u2019re building cars and homes and businesses that waste less energy,\u201d Obama said.

VBARNALA: Could anyone imagine the islands on the South Pole ( Antarctica ) without its proverbial ice? It seems unthinkable as the man\u2019s flirtation with nature, though for scientific research purposes, is paving way to global warming and seems to have cast its shadow on the icy lands as well.\u000a\u000aAntarctica has gone through major geographical changes of late and one of its islands' (King George) ice cover has totally disappeared. Even the penguins are facing the threat of extinction.This came to light after the return of the 10th International Antarctic Expedition (IAE-2013) on Saturday night, and with its return, Bandanjot Singh became the first Sikh to have explored the South Pole in an official expedition.26-year-old Bandanjot, who is a native of Barnala, returned from the expedition Saturday night and shared the experiences of his big 'journey of hope' with TOI.The expedition had left on February 28 to work for \u2018the environmental protection and sustainability\u2019. Bandanjot was to work on renewable and green energy initiatives in India to promote innovation and help rural India achieve self-sustainable energy production.\u201cAntarctica has witnessed major geographical changes since only last year as the ice cover at most of its 20 islands has noticeably receded, at the King George island , however, it has totally disappeared,\u201d said Singh."It seems that the human activity is the reason for this phenomenon as some countries have set up their bases at the Antarctic. The use of diesel generating sets and automobiles are also giving way to global warming," Singh added.Bandanjot, who was part of the expedition with 60 other members from 28 countries, became a proud Indian and Sikh by unfurling the Indian and the Sikh flag portraying the Sikh religious symbol at island Neko Harbour.Bandanjot said the team members, lead by British explorer Sir Robert Swan, literally witnessed the climate changes.He said that as per members of the last expedition, the changes were drastic, as there was about 800-metre of thick ice cover at King George island which has now completely disappeared and at other islands too, it has receded.He said the power breakdown in the northern grid in the recent past and hurricane Sandy in US were the urgent points for me to explore in Antarctica and the expedition aimed at creating leaders for education, environment with the theme of \u2018Leadership on the edge\u2019, proved highly beneficial to achieve the goals, he said.Having done an integrated course of B Tech instrumentation and M Sc Physics from BITS Pilani, Bandanjot presently working for a US company National Instruments, had no past experience of such an expedition.A chance meeting with Sir Robert Swan \u2014 the first person to walk both the North and South Pole \u2014 made him work hard to be part of the expedition and Singh was clearly overjoyed after getting selected.

VLONDON: Britain\u2019s butterflies have suffered the worst year in history with dozens of species facing extinction.\u000a\u000aThe unnatural downpur during the summer of 2012 has proved \u2018catastrophic\u2019 for the insects, with 52 of the 56 monitored species in decline and overall butterfly sightings nose diving by 300,000.The variety of butterflies called Hairstreaks did particularly badly last year - the Black Hairstreak, one of the UK\u2019s rarest species, saw its population fall by 98%.The Green Hairstreak was down 68%, the White-letter Hairstreak fell by 72% and the Brown Hairstreak, slipped by 34%.Many common species struggled.The Common Blue plummeted by 60%, the Brown Argus collapsed by 73% and the Large Skipper fell by 55%.Some of the rarest species such as the fritillaries bore the brunt of the second wettest year on record and now face the real threat of extinction in some parts of the UK.Last year\u2019s relentless rain and cold created disastrous conditions for summer-species in particular as they struggled to find food, shelter and mating opportunities; butterfly abundance plummeted to a record low as a result and 13 species suffered their worst year on record.The critically endangered High Brown Fritillary fell by 46%, the vulnerable Marsh Fritillary was down 71% and the endangered Heath Fritillary saw its population plummet by 50% in comparison to 2011.Many of UK\u2019s most threatened butterflies were already in a state of long-term decline prior to the 2012 deluge.There are now real fears that these already struggling species could become extinct in some parts of the UK as a result of last year\u2019s wet weather.The widespread \u2018Whites\u2019 including Green-Veined White and the two 'Cabbage Whites', Large White and Small White saw their populations tumble by more than 50%. The Orange-tip fell by 34%.The alarming slide of garden favourite the Small Tortoiseshell continued with its population slipping 37% from 2011 figures.Data was gathered by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme ( UKBMS ) jointly led by Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH).Only four species saw their populations increase.The grass-feeding Meadow Brown was up 21% and the Scotch Argus, which thrives in damp conditions, rose by 55%.Dr Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201c2012 was a catastrophic year for almost all of our butterflies, halting progress made through our conservation efforts in recent years.\u201cButterflies have proved before that given favourable conditions and the availability of suitable habitat they can recover, but with numbers in almost three-quarters of UK species at a historically low ebb any tangible recovery will be more difficult than ever.\u201dUKBMS has run since 1976 and involves thousands of volunteers collecting data every week throughout the summer from more than 1,000 sites across the UK.CEH butterfly ecologist Dr Marc Botham said: \u201cDespite the horrific weather in 2012 over 1,500 dedicated volunteers still managed to collect data from over a thousand sites across the UK. Their amazing efforts enable us to assess the impacts of wet summers on butterfly diversity.\u201d

VVISAKHAPATNAM: The summer of 2013 could well be the hottest that Vizagites have seen in more than a hundred years, thanks to the soaring mercury already zooming past the 37 degrees Celsius mark in the Port City much before the onset of summer, feel experts.Temperatures in the month of March, which usually hover around 33 degress Celsius, touched 37.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday at the airport in the City of Destiny, giving an indication of the torrid time the citizens are in for this summer.\u201cThis is truly a first for the month of March as we have never recorded such high temperatures and things could only get hotter from here,\u201d said Prof OSRU Bhanukumar, former head of the meteorology department in Andhra University, indicating that temperatures could well shoot up to 45 degrees Celsius and above as the summer progresses.\u201cThe average mean temperature around this time of the year (end of March) should be 32.8 degrees Celsius but Vizag has already experienced a sudden rise of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius. This clearly indicates that we could experience extremely high temperatures.\u201dAccording to Prof Bhanukumar, temperatures have been on the rise virtually every year for the last ten years with the period from 2002-04, 2006-07 and 2009-11 ranking among the hottest years ever since 1901 due to a combination of a steady rise in regional temperatures due to local factors and thunder showers in the driest months of the year (February and March).\u201cThe last 12 years since 2000 have been the warmest in the region, not just the city, over the last 112 years. This is a clear indication of global warming. Usually February and March are the driest months of the year, but in the last few years, especially since 2010, we have had thunder cloud formation and thunder showers in the region during these two months,\u201d he explained.

VLONDON: United Kingdom will require an investment of 110 billion pounds in its energy infrastructure by 2020, majority of which will be raised \u201cfrom overseas markets like India.\u201d\u000a\u000aguaranteed return.\u201d Officials from UK\u2019s prosperity directorate have told\u000a\u000athat the country\u2019s \u201cageing power plants are now reaching end of life.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Foreign and Commonwealth office of UK told the TOI that majority of this investment will be made in building nuclear power stations and have promised Indian companies willing to invest , \u201ca long termTOI\u201cNuclear power is low carbon, affordable, dependable, safe and capable of increasing the diversity of energy supply. New nuclear power stations will help the UK. It will also help us achieve our goal of 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2015. It would be in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations,\u201d a senior official told TOI.India at present has 20 operational nuclear reactors in six nuclear power plants with a capacity of 4.4 gigawatts (electric). As of September 2012, seven reactors totaling 5.3 gigawatts (electric) are under construction and expected to come online by 2016.As electricity demand in India continues to grow, the government has indicated that it plans to increase the nuclear share of total generation to 25% in the long term from about 4% in 2011. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday that in September 2008, India became a party to the Nuclear Suppliers\u2019 Group agreement, which opened access to nuclear technology and expertise through several cooperative agreements.The government has signed several such agreements with countries including the United States, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom. In addition, via these agreements, India gained access to reactor parts and fuel from other countries.The Indian government has announced a \u201cthree-stage nuclear development plan\u201d to gradually shift from powering reactors with natural uranium to accumulating reserves of other fissile materials such as thorium.While the Indian nuclear sector historically has had limited access to uranium, it has abundant thorium reserves that can power more sophisticated reactors.On Tuesday, planning consent was given for construction of the first new nuclear power station in the UK since 1995, in a boost to the move to a low carbon energy mix. The planned multi-billion pound project at Hinkley Point, Somerset will generate enough low carbon electricity to power the equivalent of five million households, making it one of the largest power stations in the UK.Two new reactors will be built, supporting between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent jobs during operation. Edward Davey , energy Secretary said \u201cLow carbon energy projects will bring major investment, supporting jobs and driving growth. This planned project adds to a number of new energy projects consented since May 2010, including wind farms and biomass and gas-fired power stations.\u201d

VParts of Maharashtra are experiencing an unprecedented drought. Even drinking water is becoming a chemical curiosity. Some areas of the state have always experienced periodic droughts and several excellent drought relief and water management programmes have been developed in this State.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor instance, former chief ministers like YB Chavan and Vasantrao Naik had propagated the idea of Pani Panchayats at the village level. I am not sure what recent contributions have been. The only help the government can immediately extend is to provide water for domestic consumption.\u000a\u000aMaharashtra has experience in drought proofing but what we now need is a well defined Drought Code which will indicate the proactive measures that need to be taken. For example, seed reserves of alternative crops in perennial drought areas are important.\u000a\u000aWith the onset of the era of climate change, extreme weather events like drought and floods are likely to become more frequent.\u000a\u000aIf there could be a well planned programme for ground water use coupled with drip irrigation, it will help our farmers. Drought management has to become an integral part of climate management.\u000a\u000aA cadre of Drought Managers will have to be developed at the village level. They should be well-versed in the art and science of drought management with particular reference to water harvesting and efficient water use.\u000a\u000aThe state government has a water policy. It has to develop a land-use policy. Land and water-use cannot be separated since land-use decisions are also water-use decisions.\u000a\u000aSugarcane cultivation is a case in point. Joint studies carried out by the central ground water board, Union ministry of water eesources and the Government of Maharashtra indicate that nine blocks out of 353 in the state fall under the \u2018over-exploited\u2019 category; 1 in \u2018critical category\u2019 and 19 in \u2018semi-critical category\u2019.\u000a\u000aThe remaining 324 blocks fall in \u2018safe\u2019 category. In the blocks falling under the safe category, we should develop Ground Water Sanctuaries which could be tapped for domestic use as well as for the needs of farm animals, when absolutely essential.\u000a\u000aThe state government has already enacted the Maharashtra Ground Water Regulation for Drinking Water Purposes Act in 1993. A more comprehensive draft Ground Water Bill is also being developed.\u000a\u000aWhat is now important is to make rain water harvesting mandatory both in farms and in homes. At the same time, a movement for higher income and crop per drop of water should be promoted in all gram sabhas and local bodies.

VPanaji, April 3 (IANS) A study by a leading central government funded marine research institute has debunked a claim by a Brazilian agency that Indian freshwater reservoirs, especially those of dams, were sources of methane.\u000a\u000aScientists of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), who conducted studies at eight reservoirs in the country - including the Selaulim reservoir in Goa and the Tillari reservoir in Maharashtra - found that methane produced by these reservoirs was minimal to the point of being insignificant.\u000a\u000aThe team, led by scientist Gayatree Narvekar, concluded that most of the methane produced in Indian reservoirs is converted to carbon dioxide by methane oxidizing microorganisms and that methane emission to the atmosphere from the Indian dam-reservoirs has been greatly overestimated.\u000a\u000a"Although most of these reservoirs were found to turn anaerobic during the summer, measured dissolved methane concentrations are substantially lower than assumed. Moreover, accumulation of methane generally occurred below the depths of water intake for power generation and irrigation," the NIO said in a statement Wednesday.\u000a\u000aA study by Ivan Lima and his colleagues from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, published in a peer-reviewed journal, concluded that annual methane emissions from dam-reservoirs in India alone were estimated to be around 33.5 million tonnes.\u000a\u000aThat figure, if true, would amount to about 19 percent of the country's global warming emissions from all sources and 28 percent of methane emission from all large dams of the world.\u000a\u000a"These figures raised a great deal of alarm in the media and among policy makers," the NIO statement said.\u000a\u000aThe NIO scientists made extensive measurements of methane in eight dams-reservoirs across India from the Western Ghats (Selaulim, Supa, Tillari, Koyna and Markandeya) to the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (Rihand) and the foothills of the Himalayas (Bhakra Nangal).\u000a\u000a"Although most of these reservoirs were found to turn anaerobic during the summer, measured dissolved methane concentrations are substantially lower than assumed in the above-mentioned study," the NIO said.\u000a\u000a"These results demonstrate that the hydroelectric power in the country appears to be quite green," the NIO said.

VCHENNAI: Volkswagen India\u2019s \u2018Think Blue. Factory\u2019 initiatives for sustainable automotive production has helped its Pune plant reduce CO2 emissions by 6.4% and energy consumption by 5.5%. The company said in a statement that its target is to reduce total fresh water consumption by 10% in 2013.Environmental sustainability is a global target set by Volkswagen. The \u2018Think Blue. Factory\u2019 project, which was globally announced in 2011 and implemented in the Pune plant from 2012, focuses on reducing the environmental impact of all Volkswagen plants across the world by 25% by 2018 based on 2010 values. This applies especially to energy consumption, water consumption, waste generation, air-borne emissions including carbon dioxide emissions.Mahesh Kodumudi, president & MD, Volkswagen India Private Limited, said, "The strategic goal for the Volkswagen Group is the economic and environmental leadership in the global automotive industry by 2018. The 'Think Blue. Factory.' initiatives are a key to achieving the goals.With the 'Think Blue. Factory.' initiatives we aim to reduce the impact on the environment by 25% by 2018."Volkswagen undertook several actions at its Pune plant from 2012 as a part of "Think Blue. Factory." initiatives. Through these actions, Volkswagen Pune Plant achieved a reduction of 6.4% in specific CO2 emissions and 5.5% in specific energy consumption in 2012 as compared to 2011. The prime initiatives leading to this reduction included optimizing on/off timings of equipments, replacing high energy consumption lights with low energy consumption lights and reduction of electric lights by utilizing natural lighting in various areas of the plant. The biggest achievement for Volkswagen India is the specific energy consumption at its Pune plant that has now been reduced to 1.016 MWh/car which happens to be the best amongst the Volkswagen plants worldwide. The energy saving achievements were also recognized with a global Volkswagen Energy Award in 2012.Mr Andreas Lauenroth, Executive Director Technical, Volkswagen India Private Limited, commented, "'Think Blue. Factory.' is a holistic approach which motivates our employees to implement the 'Think Blue. Factory.' ideas not only in the plant but also in their personal lifestyle."One of the next steps towards achieving the targets of the "Think Blue. Factory." initiatives is the inauguration of a Biogas plant in the premises of the Volkswagen Pune factory. Monthly biological waste of approximately 10 tonne will be fed to the highly automated and modern Biogas plant which will recycle the waste to produce cooking gas. This ecologically produced gas will be supplied back to the central kitchen for cooking processes.

VStrasbourg/Brussels: European Union politicians rejected a plan to prop up the world\u2019s biggest carbon market on Tuesday, sending it plunging to a new record low and raising questions about its survival.\u000a\u000aAfter months of bitter debate, a plenary session of European Parliament in Strasbourg rejected by 19 votes a commission proposal to temporarily remove some of the oversupply that has overwhelmed the market for permits to emit carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aIreland, holder of the rotating EU presidency, said support for the carbon market was still a clear priority and it would seek agreement from member states as a matter of urgency.\u000a\u000aTraders took the lack of political support as a signal to sell, driving the market down to its lowest yet. Immediately after the vote, carbon prices dropped by around 40% to \u20ac2.63 a tonne.\u000a\u000aThey were trading at \u20ac3.15, down 33.82%, by 1205 GMT.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe carbon market is now in a coma, until a clear intervention takes place,\u201d an emissions trader said.\u000a\u000aConnie Hedegaard Climate commissionersaid in a statement the Commission was still convinced its proposal, known as backloading, could restore confidence in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) pending deeper reforms.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will now reflect on the next steps to ensure that Europe has a strong EU ETS,\u201d Hedegaard said. \u201cThe market, the investors and our international partners are all waiting.\u201d\u000a\u000aA majority of member states, which have been debating the plan in parallel with the parliamentary process, is said to support the Commission proposal. National representatives are expected to debate what to do next this week.\u000a\u000aNot so quick\u000a\u000aThe commission proposal, named backloading, was meant to be a quick fix that could be agreed by the end of last year.\u000a\u000aBut it has exposed deep divisions, with interest groups intensively lobbying members of the European Parliament.\u000a\u000aSome analysts have also warned that failure to agree on EU steps could spur fragmentation in environmental policy as member nations move to safeguard their own green targets.\u000a\u000aRoyal Dutch Shell The power sector and other energy companies, such as, keen to promote natural gas rather than more carbon-intensive coal, have been strong supporters.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say a carbon price of around \u20ac50 is needed to encourage a switch away from coal to generation from less polluting sources.\u000a\u000aTogether with more than 40 firms, representing more than \u20ac875 billion ($1.15 trillion) in turnover, Shell placed a full-page advertisement in the Financial Times newspaper on Monday, saying backloading was needed as a stop-gap measure.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout agreement on the backloading proposal the price will fall further threatening the long-term survival of the EU ETS and lead to fragmentation of the single energy market through a patchwork of national regulations,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aOpponents of the commission plan, have been led by energy intensive industries.\u000a\u000aThey have argued intervention in the ETS will push up energy costs when Europe is already suffering a competitive disadvantage compared with the United States, which has benefited from abundant supplies of shale gas.\u000a\u000aEU business lobby BUSINESSEUROPE welcomed Tuesday\u2019s vote and said the focus should be on long-term reform.\u000a\u000aAdrian van den Hoven Reuters. \u201cWe want an ETS, but without political interference,\u201d, the body\u2019s deputy director-general, told\u000a\u000aStructural reform\u000a\u000aDebate on deeper structural reforms is already under way, but is expected to take a long time via tangled EU process.\u000a\u000aApart from seeking lasting solutions, such as the permanent withdrawal of allowances, the Commission has also kicked off debate on 2030 energy and environment policy to succeed a set of 2020 goals.\u000a\u000aAt member state level, EU sources say a majority supports backloading even though Poland, heavily reliant on carbon-intensive coal, is opposed to it and Germany has failed to take a formal position because of divisions within its government on the issue.

VAHMEDABAD: The Indian city of Ahmedabad launched a first-of-its-kind Heat Action Plan, making it the first city in South Asia to create a comprehensive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat events fueled by climate change. The project created by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) in partnership with an international coalition of health and academic groups, that will help in reducing the deadly impact of extreme heat by initiating an early warning system for residents, providing preparation training to medical and community workers, building public awareness of the heat-related risks, and coordinating an inter-agency emergency response efforts when heat waves hit."Our first priority is the people of Ahmedabad, and they need to be protected from the impacts of climate change," said AMC Commissioner Guruprasad Mohapatra. "Our Heat Action Plan provides the roadmap we need to save lives when the next dangerous heat wave hits." said Mayor Asit Vora previewed the draft plan in March and the city has already started taking life-saving actions. The plan will go for formal administrative approvals of the AMC next week.The launch of this Heat Action Plan is part of a broader collaboration dating back to early 2011 between AMC and public health and policy experts at the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar , Public Health Foundation of India, Natural Resources Defense Council, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University , and Georgia Institute of Technology, and supported by the Climate & Development Knowledge Network.Ahmedabad's efforts to better prepare for future extreme heat events are, in part, a response to the deadly heat wave in May 2010. Temperatures spiked at 46.8C (more than 116F), and hundreds of people died. Extreme heat can lead to dangerous, even deadly, health consequences, including heat stress and heatstroke. As climate change worsens, extreme heat events are expected to become more frequent and more severe."Unbearable temperatures are already having a deadly impact in Ahmedabad, and it's only going to get worse due to climate change," said Anjali Jaiswal, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's India Initiative. "But Ahmedabad is rising to the challenge by implementing strategies to proactively help its residents adapt to increasing heat. By building awareness, training health professionals, and implementing a coordinated heat plan, Ahmedabad is showing other at-risk regions the way forward.""Ahmedabad's most vulnerable populations have been carefully identified through on-the-ground studies, focus groups, interviews, and workshops that considered factors affecting heat exposure, susceptibility to heat-related illness, and adaptive capacity," explained Dr. Jeremy Hess, Assistant Professor of Environmental Health at the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University. "Ahmedabad's Heat Action Plan is tailored to help the city's at-risk residents cope with rising heat."Ahmedabad's Heat Action Plan describes both immediate and longer-term actions to increase preparedness, information-sharing, and response coordination to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations. It includes, preventative training and awareness building for medical professionals and slum community outreach workers. Under the plan the heat-health protection trainings would also be provided for school children, outdoor workers, and other vulnerable groups.The plan would also include communications outreach, such as an early warning system that will immediately alert the public of impending heat waves, the distribution of multilingual pamphlets, and long-term awareness-building ad campaigns. Apart from this, there would be coordinated action by government agencies at the municipal, state, and national levels to ensure successful implementation of the preparedness plan and warning system."You cannot start digging water-well once the fire starts. You need to have already dug the well, bought the pump, and put everything in place beforehand. By planning ahead, we can prepare for heat waves before they hit and save many more lives," said Dr. Dileep Mavalankar, Dean of the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.Ahmedabad's efforts are unique in South Asia, as countries and international organizations have yet to establish comprehensive heat preparedness plans in the region. In recent years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has included among its goals the strengthening of health systems to cope with the health threats posed by climate change. Among seven nations hosting WHO pilot projects related to climate change and health, China has an early heat warning system planned.On Tuesday, four related policy briefs entitled Rising Temperatures, Deadly Threat, have also been released by the collaboration of partners. These briefs outline key strategies in the Heat Action Plan that cities across the world can adopt to protect against heat wave impacts.

VMUMBAI: Seeking to restart the debate over prohibitory pricing of green technologies, a top Finance Ministry official today said the poor should not be made to pay through their nose for sustainable technologies by the developed world.Blaming the Western world for putting the onus of fighting climate change on the developing world, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said it was ironical that the poor were made to pay for follies of the rich.Mayaram said the developed world wanted "the developing countries not to use the fossil fuels like coal, lignite which are available...and use solar energy , or wind power etc., while the state-of-the-art technologies are with the developed countries."Blaming the approach of the Western world for insisting on poor nations pay for better technologies, he said, "You pay for the intellectual property (developed by the West), you buy their technology, you use the technology, and you make your consumer pay more so that the world can be changed..."The poor must pay more for cooling the earth," Mayaram, noted sarcastically while speaking at an event organised by Ficci and the Asian Development Bank Mayaram also expressed displeasure at the functioning of the multilateral agencies like World Bank and Asian Development Bank, saying theirs is a "mixed response" when it comes to helping developing countries vis-a-vis helping the richer ones."The response of the multilateral banks, financial institutions, whether it is the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, has been mixed as far as the developing countries are concerned," he said, without going into the specifics.Mayaram, however, said New Delhi expects a lot more help from the Asian Development Bank."There is a lot that we expect from the ADB. We believe it is our bank. It is our bank because it is in the region and we part-own the bank and, therefore, it is our bank."New Delhi has been steadfastly stressing that the developing countries should not be considered at par with the developed world when it comes to signing climate change treaties, stating that growth rates would suffer.Mayaram also said lack of access to technology is another reason for the slowing investment and trade growth.

VThe UPA government\u2019s flagship employment guarantee programme can play an important role in conserving natural resources and sustaining water supply and food production, according to a study. Conceived to provide livelihood security for the rural poor, the scheme can also help reduce and counter the impact of climate change in villages, according to the study, \u201cEnvironmental Benefits and Vulnerability Reduction through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme\u201d by IISc, Bangalore in collaboration with the rural development ministry and the German international co-operation agency, GIZ. It studied four districts that represent diverse agro-climatic and socio-economic characteristics \u2014 Medak in Andhra Pradesh, Chitradurga in Karnataka, Dhar in Madhya Pradesh, and Bhilwara in Rajasthan.It found that about 80% of the works taken up under NREGA involved natural resources such as surface and ground water, crop lands, soil and wastelands. Efforts at water conservation, drought proofing , renovation of traditional water bodies have contributed to improved ground water levels, increased water availability for irrigation, increase in irrigated land. According to the study, improvement in soil quality and reduction in erosion have also been reported. Its positive impact has translated into increased crop production.This could well be a boon for the vast rural population that depends on agriculture but is too poor to invest in improving land and water quality. Some studies show that over the next 150 years, unchecked climate change could mean that monsoon rainfall, the crucial input for food production in India, may fall short by 40%-70%. Already, changing rainfall patterns are beginning to impact the lives of agriculture-dependent people in countries like India.The study found that works taken up as part of NREGA\u2019s job portfolio helped maintain ground water levels, aiding crop productivity . The study reports that ground water level in 2012 were in the range of the measurements recorded by the Central Ground Water Board in 2006-07\u2014 indicating that despite increased extraction water levels in villages that set up check dams, percolation tanks, and desilted existing tanks had either increased or remained at the same level as the pre-NREGA period. The most remarkable contribution was that of improved drinking water availability. Households in the four districts reported that increase in the number of water bodies, ground water levels and number of days of water availability from other sources had resulted in a rise in water usage. In the Chitradurga district of Karnataka, villages had used the programme to construct dedicated cattle ponds and troughs.Taking up works like land leveling silt application , drought proofing, pasture development under the employment scheme has, according to the study, improved the content of organic carbon of soil and reduced top soil erosion. Of the 899 sample plots studied, 72% reported improved soil carbon content compared to plots where no such effort had been made. Most of the villagers would have been unable to undertake any similar improvement measure on their own. As a result of improvements in water and land, there has been an increase in area under cultivation. In Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, previously uncultivable lands are now being farmed, while in rainfed Dhar, agriculture is no longer a one crop affair. In Dhar, the land under cultivation in the Rabi season has also increased from 43.5% to 102.5%.It has recommended that the programme continues to focus on natural resources and prioritises creation of community assets and resources. Beyond creation, it suggested that equal attention be paid to maintenance of assets, such as check dams, irrigation tanks, canals, community grazing lands. This would ensure that gains in livelihood are sustained. Another intervention that has been suggested is the creation of an information base, which would help villages to ensure that assets are mapped and their maintenance monitored. This would guarantee that assets once created do not fall into disuse.

VIn February 2011, the Australian government established an independent body, the Climate Commission, to provide unbiased scientific information to the public about climate change. Although meant primarily for Australia, the reports of the commission are now attracting global attention.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts first report said key decisions would have to be made this decade if we are to keep climate change to manageable levels. Its second report, published in August last year, said major countries were taking action to combat climate change. The third, published this week, concluded that the US and China have accelerated their efforts to tackle climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn fact, China is the global leader now in action to combat global warming. It is a dramatic change from a few years ago, when the world was accusing China of having scant regard for the environment.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCoal Warning\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Climate Commission report provides great hope for a world now reeling under droughts and floods. None of the official negotiations has worked in forcing substantial agreements from governments, but the major polluters are on track to reduce carbon dioxide emissions anyway.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChina has reduced its carbon intensity by 5% in 2012 and halved its growth in electricity demand. It invested $65.1 billion in 2012 on clean energy, and increased its solar power capacity by 75% in two years.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe US invested $35.6 billion on renewable energy in 2012, and is on target to reach its goal of reducing its emissions by 17% between 2005 and 2020. It also doubled renewable energy capacity in the last four years. Total US emissions have started declining, and China\u2019s emissions are now projected to start declining around 2025, earlier than expected.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd yet, concluded the report, a lot needs to be done to reduce global carbon emissions to zero. Amidst all this good news, we might forget that we are plucking low-hanging fruits. The report does not mention what is being planned around the world, decisions that will increase the global emissions for a long time.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe most serious problem is with coal, which is still the leading supplier of the world\u2019s energy. Over 1,000 coal-fired power plants are being planned around the world, whose combined effect \u2014 with existing plants \u2014would be tough to deal with.

VGeneva: The Arctic\u2019s sea ice melted at a record pace in 2012, the ninth-hottest year on record, compounding concerns about climate change underscored by extreme weather such as Hurricane Sandy, the UN weather agency said Thursday.\u000a\u000aIn a report on the situation in 2012, the World Meterological Organisation said that during the August to September melting season, the Arctic\u2019s sea ice cover was just 3.4 million square kilometres (1.32 million square miles).\u000a\u000aThat was a full 18% less than the previous record low set in 2007.\u000a\u000aMichel Jarraud WMO secretary-generaldubbed it a \u201cdisturbing sign of climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe year 2012 saw many other extremes as well, such as droughts and tropical cyclones. Natural climate variability has always resulted in such extremes, but the physical characteristics of extreme weather and climate events are being increasingly shaped by climate change,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor example, because global sea levels are now about 20 centimetres higher than they were in 1880, storms such as Hurricane Sandy are bringing more coastal flooding than they would have otherwise,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aOctober\u2019s Hurricane Sandy killed almost 300 people and caused major destruction in the Caribbean before developing further strength and causing tens of billions of dollars in damage and around 130 deaths in the eastern United States.\u000a\u000aTyphoon Bopha, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the year, hit the Philippines twice in December, sparking floods and landslides which killed more than 1,000 people.\u000a\u000aThe WMO said that the 2012 global land and ocean surface temperature was estimated to be 0.45C above the 1961-1990 average of 14C.\u000a\u000aThat marked the ninth warmest year since records began in 1850 and the 27th consecutive year that the global land and ocean temperatures were above the 1961-1990 average, it underlined.\u000a\u000aJarraud noted that the rate of warming varies from year to year due to a range of factors, including the El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena \u2014 which see warming and cooling, respectively, in the Pacific Ocean \u2014 as well as volcanic eruptions.\u000a\u000aLast year\u2019s warming came despite a cooling La Nina at the beginning of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sustained warming of the lower atmosphere is a worrisome sign,\u201d said Jarraud.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe continued upward trend in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and the consequent increased radiative forcing of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere confirm that the warming will continue,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAbove-average temperatures were observed across most of the globe\u2019s land surface areas, most notably North America, southern Europe, western Russia, parts of northern Africa and southern South America, the WMO noted.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, cooler than average conditions were observed across Alaska, parts of northern and eastern Australia, and central Asia, it said.\u000a\u000aPrecipitation also varied, with drier-than-average conditions across much of the central United States, northern Mexico, northeastern Brazil, central Russia, and south-central Australia.\u000a\u000aNorthern Europe, western Africa, north-central Argentina, western Alaska, and most of northern China were meanwhile wetter than average.

VA comprehensive analysis of 4,000 studies on climate change published over last 21 years has revealed an overwhelming consensus among climate scientists that humans are to blame for global warming, researchers claim.\u000a\u000aThe study is the most comprehensive yet and identified 4,000 summaries, otherwise known as abstracts that stated a position on the cause of recent global warming \u2014 97 per cent of these endorsed the consensus that we are seeing human-made, or anthropogenic, global warming (AGW).\u000a\u000aThe study went one step further, asking the authors of these papers to rate their entire paper using the same criteria. Over 2,000 papers were rated and among those that discussed the cause of recent global warming, 97 per cent endorsed the consensus that it is caused by humans.\u000a\u000aThe findings are in stark contrast to the public\u2019s position on global warming \u2014 a 2012 poll revealed that more than half of Americans either disagree, or are unaware, that scientists overwhelmingly agree that Earth is warming because of human activity.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary,\u201d lead author John Cook, from the University of Queensland, said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a gaping chasm between the actual consensus and the public perception. It\u2019s staggering given the evidence for consensus that less than half of the general public think scientists agree that humans are causing global warming.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is significant because when people understand that scientists agree on global warming, they\u2019re more likely to support policies that take action on it,\u201d said Cook.\u000a\u000aIn March 2012, the researchers used the ISI Web of Science database to search for peer-reviewed academic articles published between 1991 and 2011 using two topic searches: \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cglobal climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter limiting the selection to peer\u2014reviewed climate science, the study considered 11,994 papers written by 29,083 authors in 1,980 different scientific journals.\u000a\u000aThe abstracts from these papers were randomly distributed between a team of 24 volunteers recruited through the \u201cmyth-busting\u201d website skepticalscience.com, who used set criteria to determine the level to which the abstracts endorsed that humans are the primary cause of global warming.\u000a\u000aEach abstract was analysed by two independent, anonymous raters.\u000a\u000aFrom the 11,994 papers, 32.6 per cent endorsed AGW, 66.4 per cent stated no position on AGW, 0.7 per cent rejected AGW and in 0.3 per cent of papers, the authors said the cause of global warming was uncertain.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in IOP Publishing\u2019s journal Environmental Research Letters.

VA chunk of ice is shown drifting after it separated from the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf off the north coast of Ellesmere Island in Canada's far north on Sunday July 27, 2008. The sheet is the biggest piece shed by one of Canada's six ice shelves since the Ayles shelf broke loose in 2005 from the coast of Ellesmere, about 500 miles from the North Pole. (AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Sam Soja) | Photo Credit: SAM SOJA\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aAround 2005, accelerated melting of polar ice sheet and mountain glaciers, together with rising sea level, caused the North Pole to drift towards east, marking an \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the direction recorded over the past century. Accelerated rates of ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica have been observed since 2005-2006 and thus coincide with the abrupt change in polar shift.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen mass is lost in one part of a spinning sphere, its spin axis will tilt directly towards the position of the loss,\u201d Erik Ivins, a geophysicist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California was quoted as saying in Nature.\u000a\u000aThe melting ice has also increased the rate of drift from about two milliarcseconds (MAS) per year during the period 1982-2005 to about nine MAS per year post 2005, a study published recently in the Geophysical Research Letters journal states.\u000a\u000aThe changes were recorded by satellite gravity measurements by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, jointly sponsored by U.S. and Germany.\u000a\u000aGRACE provides monthly gravity field data that correlates with mass changes for the entire Earth, and from this, it is possible to extract the precise contributions from individual sources. This information helped the scientists in pinning down the cause of abrupt pole drift in 2005 to \u201cvariations in climate system\u201d.\u000a\u000aAtmospheric and terrestrial water storage changes have made only a \u201cminor\u201d contribution to the shift in Pole direction and rate. The researchers from the University of Texas at Austin consider this study as a reaffirmation of the increased ice melting at poles and mountain glaciers in recent years. This is borne from the fact that mass movement in solid earth takes place over long time scales.\u000a\u000aSince earth monitoring using satellites has begun only during the last few years, there is no way of knowing the rate and amount of ice-sheet melting in the past. However, data on polar motion is available, thus making it possible to extrapolate the polar ice-sheet melting in the past.

VA demand for the creation of a separate window under the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) has been made by the industry. It may provide a boost to the country\u2019s domestic solar energy projects by providing easy access to finance for such clean energy technology, the industry has stated in a FICCI white paper.\u000a\u000aThe paper on reducing the cost of finance for solar energy projects through NCEF has been submitted to the government for consideration.\u000a\u000aThe Fund was announced in the budget 2011-12 and is expected to be a step for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technology. The white paper in essence, suggests innovative models for sharing and distribution of risk and cost of financing through NCEF as the cost of financing from the domestic Financial Institutions is high.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven the challenges faced by the solar industry in India due to the high cost of finance, the government\u2019s decision to extend an interest subsidy from the NCEF for enabling lowering the cost of finance for renewable energy projects is a commendable step,\u201d states the white paper.\u000a\u000aThe paper recommends that the interest subsidy be made available for eligible projects and routed through the lenders to such projects so that borrowers would get lower interest rates for the loans while the lenders directly receive the subsidy. The FICCI Solar Energy Task Force was launched in February 2010, with the launch of Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) to provide a platform for the solar energy sector to deliberate on policy and regulatory issues and advance interests of the sector at domestic and global platforms.\u000a\u000aThe document states that since solar energy projects are treated on par and as part of all power sector and categorised under power for categorisation and monitoring of sector exposure, it limits the availability of finance to the sector. Treating solar energy projects under a separate category (say, Renewable Power) or under a sub-limit, similar to RPO norms stipulated by Electricity Regulatory Commissions, will provide the much needed fillip to lending to solar energy projects. In view of the absence of a separate exposure limit to renewable energy, providing a thrust to the sector for creating additional funding mechanisms becomes an imperative.\u000a\u000aAn interest subsidy could be made available for eligible projects and routed through the lenders to such projects. Thus, borrowers would get lower interest rates for the loans (not a reimbursement) while the lenders directly receive the subsidy. Since number of projects seeking such interest subsidy will be relatively large, some selection mechanism will have to be implemented to select such projects.\u000a\u000aOne way to select such projects can be in line with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) scheme for rooftop subsidy, where-in channel partners can directly seek subsidy on behalf of customers. In a similar way, the Concerned Nodal Agency (CNA) can have banks as channel partners where-in Banks would be able to seek interest subsidy directly on behalf of projects. Under such a mechanism, banks acting as Channel Partners would do their own due diligence on the projects before approaching MNRE or the CNA. This will ensure that only quality projects get such an interest subsidy.\u000a\u000aSince there are no industry-wide benchmarked interest rates, domestic lenders typically lend on semi-fixed rate, that is, interest rate linked to a base rate which is reviewed from time to time. Such fluctuation in the rate of interest is borne by the borrowers. The lenders may be incentivised to provide fixed interest rate loan for three to five years by providing an additional interest subsidy (for instance, 1-2 per cent per annum higher than the regular interest subsidy). Cost of financing can also be brought down through a guarantee scheme that guarantees a certain percentage of exposure to banks.\u000a\u000aNon-performance of this guarantee scheme can be funded through the NCEF. NCEF will need to create a corpus that will act as a backstop determined based on an assumed default rate. To prevent the issue of moral hazard, guarantee can be provided on 50 per cent of exposure to the bank.\u000a\u000aThe white paper is of the view that interest rates in India are high compared to other countries including developed and other emerging markets such as China. While loans from international organisations are available at a low interest rate, the hedging costs have impeded its utility. While multilateral agencies are willing to lend, they do not want to take the Rupee exposure. In case of floating rate, the hedging cost includes cost of hedging currency and cost of hedging interest rate. Both these costs lead to a much higher effective cost of debt. As a result, a fully hedged loan in foreign currency, for example the US Dollar, becomes expensive. It is suggested that while the fluctuation in the rate of interest in the case of international loans may be borne by the borrower, the currency should be hedged with government support.

VNEW DELHI: India on Wednesday signed up to the Arctic Council as an observer, a step that gives it a foothold in the future of the resources-rich Arctic Ocean as the ice melts and everything from navigation to oil and gas may be up for grabs. India joined China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Singapore in the council.The council comprises eight Arctic nations: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US.India has lobbied assiduously for a place in this body for some time. In November, at the ASEM meeting in Laos , the government lobbied hard with the Nordic countries. This was followed up during a state visit to India by the president of Iceland, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson in April. Carl Bildt , the Swedish foreign minister and until this week the chairman of the Arctic Council, was prevailed on by foreign minister Salman Khurshid at the Heart of Asia conference in Kazakhstan recently. This is part of a proactive diplomacy that got India through the door, because traditionally, India has woken up to such opportunities only after they have passed.Although India is not an Arctic state, as one of the rising economies of the world, it believes it has a stake in the Arctic Ocean and would like to be in the tent, to influence the decisions taken by the permanent members. In its application to the council, though, India focused on its science and technology expertise as the primary reason for joining up. India's institute of oceanography in Goa has undertaken signal research, specially on climate change issues in the Arctic.Answering questions about the wisdom of increasing the number of members in what is known as the Kiruna Declaration, Swedish foreign minister Bildt said, "I would say it demonstrates the broad international acceptance of the role of the Arctic Council, because by being observer, these organizations and states, they accept the principles and the sovereignty of the Arctic Council on Arctic issues. So I think, as a matter of fact, it strengthens the position of the Arctic Council on the global scene."Both India and China have been improving ties with Arctic nations and, funnily, both of them had trouble with Norway. India due to a much publicized incident with an Indian family and China because Norway, which hosts the Nobel committee, decided to give the Peace prize to a Chinese dissident.However, officials said there were many cross-currents at the Arctic Council. India did not figure in them but may have unwittingly become a beneficiary. The primary disquiet related to the membership of China, whose mercantilist pursuit of energy and mineral resources was a reason for some Nordic countries raising objections.China is keen on the northern Arctic route which apparently significantly cuts down the travel time for its energy supplies. It would also reduce its reliance on the Straits of Malacca. But China was an ad-hoc member, and has pitched its prospective membership along strategic lines. In addition, the membership of EU was deferred, largely because of its ban on Canadian seal exports.The melting ice in the Arctic Ocean means that more ships are plying the northern sea route in the summer months than ever before. In 2012, over 46 vessels sailed the route, compared to 34 in 2011 and only four in 2010. Reports said Chinese scientists aboard a Ukrainian-built icebreaker, the Xuelong or Snow Dragon, completed the country's first trans-Arctic ship voyage from Shanghai to Iceland.

Vhopes will help find a solution to the fast melting ice cover in the northernmost part of the globe, now that it has got an observer status in the Arctic Council.\u000a\u000aNorwegian ambassador Eivind S. Homme said Oslo, a member of the eight-nation Arctic Council, is "happy has shown interest in that part of the world". has a research station at Svalbard,\u000a\u000aThe Council Wednesday agreed to include India, China, Japan, Italy, South Korea and Singapore as observers.\u000a\u000aAccording to official estimates, the Arctic holds 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of undiscovered gas deposits.\u000a\u000aHomme said it was for the Council to discuss ways to find the right balance between saving the ecology and using the available resources.\u000a\u000aReferring to the Indian station at Svalbard, Homme told IANS: "That is a laboratory to see what is happening on climate change. We all need to increase our research and see what is happening."\u000a\u000aThe station is operated by the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research. It was set up in 2008.\u000a\u000a"In general and with regard to climate change, India is a key partner (with Norway)," said Homme on the sidelines of an event to celebrate Norway's Constitution Day Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe melting Arctic ice has opened up the region's waterways to commercial shipping traffic.\u000a\u000aIt has also made accessible the region's abundant quantities of oil, gas and minerals.\u000a\u000aAsked about global concerns on the rapidly melting ice at the Arctic, which scientists predict will be ice-free by 2050, Homme said the melting was happening much faster than anticipated.\u000a\u000aNorway, he said, was naturally worried. In areas of climate change, India is a key player, he added.\u000a\u000aThe Council members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US.

VThe US, which accounts for 18 per cent of the global carbon dioxide emissions, needs to work with and to make meaningful improvement on issues related to climate change and resource scarcity, a Congressional report has said.\u000a\u000a"US currently accounts for about 18 per cent of global CO2 emissions which is projected to decline to about 15 per cent by 2035 as emissions in other countries rise. Growing economies like and should reduce their intake of carbon emission," the Congressional Budget Office said in a report on the policy implications of enacting a carbon tax.\u000a\u000aThe report notes that global efforts to reduce carbon emissions have fallen short.\u000a\u000a"Analysts have estimated that in absence of a global approach, between 1 per cent and 23 per cent of the reduction in US emissions stemming from carbon tax could be offset through leakages, as higher prices for emission-intensive goods produced in US increased demand for cheaper emission intensive goods produced elsewhere," said the report.\u000a\u000aSome of the leakages could be addressed through policies, such as tariffs that would impose the same costs on imports of emission-intensive goods that a carbon tax would impose on US goods. However, practical and legal challenges to such policies could limit their effectiveness, CBO said.\u000a\u000a"Alternatively, in the case of a cap and trade programme, analysts have proposed reducing the extent to which production of emission-intensive goods would shift overseas by providing US producers in those industries with free emission allowances based on their level of production," it said.\u000a\u000aAddressing the same concerns through a carbon tax would entail providing such producers with a tax rebate that was linked to their output.\u000a\u000aA group of US lawmakers in a letter to Congressman Ed Whitfield, Chairman Subcommittee on Energy and Power and Committee on Energy and Commerce has said CBO's conclusions about the costly impacts of climate change are consistent with recent reports released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Economic Forum.\u000a\u000aIn March, UNDP had released its 2013 Human Development Report, identifying more than 40 countries in the developing world that have made significant gains in human development due to investments in education, health care and social programs.\u000a\u000aDespite this, chronic pollution and vulnerability to natural disasters continue to plague many of these countries.\u000a\u000aUNDP concluded that failing to address climate change human development progress in the world's poorest countries would come to a halt or even reverse.\u000a\u000aThe World Economic Forum's annual global risks report report released in January 2013 found that in next 10 years rising greenhouse gas emissions poses one of the biggest global risks and that failure to adapt to climate change could have a tremendous socioeconomic impact across the globe, it said.

VNEW DELHI: In a reflection of dwindling interest in them, the trading volume of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) plunged 87 per cent to 19,212 this month on the Indian Energy Exchange The trading of RECs is conducted on the last Wednesday of every month. They are used as instruments to help entities meet the Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) set by states."The total trading volumes in RECs...registered a steep fall of 87 per cent to 19,212 from a whopping 1,53,130 traded volume in the session held in May 2012," IEX said in a statement today.Of the total, non-solar RECs accounted for 18,543 while solar RECs stood at 669. One REC is equivalent to 1 MWh of energy generated from renewable sources.Further, the traded price of solar REC declined to Rs 11,490 in the latest trading session whereas it was Rs 12,206 per solar REC in April 2013 session."The floor price for non-solar REC continued to languish at Rs 1,500/REC for the tenth consecutive month," IEX noted.The latest session featured 630 market participants. IEX said the poor trading response in RECs indicates that "distribution companies and captive power generators did not participate in the market despite the fact that many of these entities are yet to fulfil a large share of their obligation".The falling interest in the market is a clear indicator that there is a need for a strict enforcement of RPO regulations by State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, IEX noted.

VDespite facing long power outages, Delhiites still seem to harbour reservations about going solar. The city lags behind several states, especially in western and southern India, in this field.\u000a\u000aDelhi gets almost the same amount of sunlight - about 10 months - as these states, yet the renewable energy revolution is yet to catch up here.\u000a\u000aTake for instance Kerala, which is building nearly 10,000 homes equipped with solar electricity and giving subsidies to people who install solar panels apart from the Centre's. Tamil Nadu has gone even bigger. It plans to build 60,000 homes fitted with solar power for the poor every year. Karnataka offers a lucrative subsidy as an incentive for installing solar home systems.\u000a\u000aThere is one big reason why these schemes have worked so well in southern states: Long power outages.\u000a\u000a"Solar energy is turning out to be reliable and cheaper alternative," a ministry official said, adding that many backward states such as Bihar and Rajasthan have come up with ambitious solar plans.\u000a\u000aIn Gujarat, it is now mandatory for all government homes to have solar panels. Rajasthan government has begun to vigorously promote solar homes in rural areas.\u000a\u000aBut central government officials said Delhi has not shown much enthusiasm towards this form of energy, so much so that the city government has even withdrawn subsidy on solar water heaters.\u000a\u000aA senior official of a private power distribution company in Delhi, however, differed with the Centre's view.\u000a\u000aHe said the scheme is not popular in the Capital because of better reliability of power and structural bottlenecks in old buildings to install solar systems. "We have not been able to move ahead from the demonstration projects," said a NDPL official, the company which generates about 17MW of solar power through pilots.\u000a\u000aCentral officials, however, said that people would opt for solar as cost of thermal power is rising constantly. "In the coming years, I can see a scenario where thermal power will supplement solar energy as it happens in countries such as Germany," an official said.\u000a\u000aTapping the emerging potential of solar power, many top companies are now selling solar inverters, a smaller version of the home system.\u000a\u000a"One can buy 800 KVA solar inverter with additional cost of Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000," said an official of one of these companies.

V* IATA may raise industry profit forecast as oil weakens\u000a\u000a* Airlines seen divided over costs of capping emissions\u000a\u000a* Industry body warns of risk if carriers don\u2019t compromise\u000a\u000aBy Tim Hepher and Siva Govindasamy\u000a\u000aCAPE TOWN, June 2 (Reuters) - Global airlines are gathering for an industry summit boosted by weaker fuel prices, but facing a tough debate over how to share the cost of tackling emissions involved in a trade row.\u000a\u000aThe International Air Transport Association, which represents 240 carriers, is holding its annual meeting against a backdrop of higher traffic and cheaper energy that could lift airline profits and unperpin hopes of economic recovery.\u000a\u000aTony Tyler, IATA\u2019s director general, said ahead of the June 2-4 talks that airlines felt \u201cmodest signs of improvement\u201d as traffic grows sharply in emerging markets, offsetting Europe\u2019s debt crisis and a hesitant pick-up in North America.\u000a\u000aNorth Sea Brent crude prices have fallen from a peak of $118 per barrel earlier this year to $100, raising the prospect that IATA will hike its influential profit forecast as airline chiefs meet in Cape Town. Fuel accounts for a third of airline costs.\u000a\u000aIATA currently predicts an industry profit of $10.6 billion in 2013 and Tyler said Monday\u2019s update would set a \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d tone for the meeting of 700 aviation executives.\u000a\u000aAn 18-month slump in cargo showed signs of stabilizing in April. In North America, airlines have managed to keep capacity in check, keeping planes full and ticket prices up.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe economy has been OK but not robust. Usually (airline) prices ebb and flow with oil and now we see they have some ability to maintain their pricing power,\u201d said Basili Alukos, an airlines analyst with Morningstar, based in Chicago.\u000a\u000aOvershadowing the discussions will be lingering fears of a trade war as governments remain deadlocked over fuel emissions.\u000a\u000aThe European Union has pledged to re-introduce a controversial emissions trading scheme opposed by a group of other countries unless everyone can agree on a global system.\u000a\u000aBut little progress has been made in a United Nations effort to craft an agreement to lower emissions from international air travel, raising doubts that a September target date can be met.\u000a\u000aFailure to agree has given the airline industry itself a slim window of opportunity to forge a common position and seize the initiative before the UN\u2019s aviation body meets in September.\u000a\u000aBut airlines are seen as split over who should pay the most if the world does manage to come up with a market-based scheme for taxing emissions deemed harmful to the environment.\u000a\u000aAirlines in the Gulf and Asia are growing at a much faster pace than those in mature European and North American markets.\u000a\u000aOne of the industry\u2019s most sensitive topics is whether the whole industry should underwrite its goal of carbon-neutral growth or whether those growing the most should also pay the most.\u000a\u000aIATA has said it will seek the \u201cfairest possible agreement\u201d at its annual summit and is urging airlines to compromise or see their fate controlled by a jumble of uncoordinated policies.

VEU faces tough decision on China solar panels\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aby Staff Writers\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBrussels (AFP) June 02, 2013\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe European Commission faces a difficult choice Wednesday -- stick to its principles and impose anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panel imports, or bow to German-led pressure and avoid a step many believe risks a full-scale trade war with Beijing.\u000a\u000aThe stakes are high, commercially and politically.\u000a\u000aOn the one hand, EU-China trade is worth more than 500 billion euros annually, a powerful incentive for everyone to keep calm at a time when both sides, and especially the 27-member EU, are looking to trade to boost growth and jobs.\u000a\u000aOn the other, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, is caught between Germany, the bloc's paymaster and biggest economy which has come out openly against duties, and France, which favours them as a way of showing that the bloc will stand up to Beijing in trade disputes.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say the Commission is in an uncomfortable place.\u000a\u000a"The Commission, given the significant and public divisions among member states, is in a very weak position," said consultant Sergio Marchi, a former Canadian trade minister and ambassador to the World Trade Organization.\u000a\u000a"It will probably seek an elegant way to save face but I'm not sure there is such a route," Marchi said, adding: "I think the Commission will need to swallow its pride on this one!"\u000a\u000aThe Commission, however, does have some limited leeway.\u000a\u000aThe tariffs to be announced Wednesday will be provisional, lasting six months, and so still allow room for negotiations with all parties.\u000a\u000aA final decision would come only in December, when EU member states would have to vote to make them permanent or not.\u000a\u000aMay has already been a busy month and China upped the ante again Friday when it added an anti-dumping probe into EU chemical exports to an investigation of seamless pipes.\u000a\u000aThese moves were set against the Commission's probe on solar panels and a possible examination of Chinese telecoms.\u000a\u000aGerman Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said on Monday there was "no longer a need for penalties", a remark all the more pointed for being made in the presence of visiting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.\u000a\u000a"We are against protectionist measures, (we are) for open markets and fair competition," Roesler said while Li commented: "This position, that is what binds China with Germany and earns my appreciation."\u000a\u000aEU sources say Germany has mustered 17 other member states against the tariffs just as France insisted they were justified and that far from harming ties with China, would actually put them on a more even keel.\u000a\u000a"We will have the chance to tell our Chinese partners that we wish to broadly refashion trade between China and the European Union, including in renewable energy," said French Ecology and Energy Minister Delphine Batho, adding that "the rules of international trade must be applied."\u000a\u000aFor his part, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, who has to make the decision on Wednesday, bluntly warned member states to be wary of China trying to influence the outcome.\u000a\u000aDe Gucht told visiting Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan that "he was ready to negotiate a solution on the solar panels case," according to a spokesman.\u000a\u000aBut De Gucht also said he was aware of the pressure exerted by China on EU member states and was more than ready to resist it.\u000a\u000a"It is the role of the European Commission to remain independent, to resist any external pressure and to see the 'big picture' for the benefit of Europe, its companies and workers based upon the evidence alone," he insisted Monday.\u000a\u000a"China has become the 28th member state of the EU," commented Daniel Cohn-Bendit, co-leader of the Greens in the European Parliament. "It influences the decision in 18 countries and it knows how to position itself."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile at the sharp end of the dispute, EU companies in China were hoping against any turn for the worse.\u000a\u000a"Who would not be concerned?" Davide Cucino, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce said of the prospects of a trade war.\u000a\u000a"We urge that both sides engage in friendly negotiations to reach any possible, amicable solutions to the issue."

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIn an Open Page article ( The Hindu, November 25, 2012), I wrote about the looming environmental crisis facing our planet. This article is prompted by my reading of the potent (and depressing) book Requiem for a species \u2014 Why we resist the truth about climate change by Clive Hamilton (published in 2010 by Earthscan). And seeing many BBC documentaries on climate change presented by Professor Iain Stewart. The scientific evidence for human-induced climate change is so incontrovertible that you have to be an absolutely brainless person to deny it.\u000a\u000aGreenhouse gases\u000a\u000aLet me give one example. An increase in average global temperatures of 20C over the next 50 years is now taken as inevitable, and it may reach as high as 4C. This may not sound like much, and sceptics will argue that Mother Earth has gone through many geological cycles in the past when temperatures have varied by much more. True. But we can study the past climate by looking at ice cores from the Antarctic. The trapped gases in each layer tell us about the existing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) at the time when the snow fell. Such a study shows that the Earth has gone through eight ice ages in the past 750,000 years. But during no time has the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases exceeded 290 parts per million (ppm), whereas it is an unprecedented 400 ppm today! In the last 17 years alone, humans have added 30 ppm to the atmosphere, something which would have taken 1,000 years for natural processes to do.\u000a\u000aPolar bears, the largest carnivores on land, have evolved over the last 300,000 years to survive in the unforgiving Arctic ice. Their diet consists almost exclusively of seals, but they cannot hunt for seals in the open sea but only on solid ice near ice holes. Arctic ice is disappearing so fast that polar bears are unable to cope and are dying. Scientists predict that there will be no permanent ice in the Arctic by the year 2040. And polar bears will become extinct.\u000a\u000aDoomed forests\u000a\u000aIn the words of Tom Friedman, author of Hot, Flat, and Crowded, it is no longer climate warming but climate weirding. Spring flowers are blooming earlier than usual, at a time when their pollinators are not around. Migration patterns of birds and animals are changing. Tropical fish from the Caribbean islands are being sighted off the coast of England. Drought is hitting areas which have never experienced it, as a consequence animals are fast losing their traditional feeding grounds. Drought-stricken forests are burning down, which is doubly harmful because forests are natural carbon sinks.\u000a\u000aBefore you think that this will affect only the under-developed world, and leave the rich industrialised countries alone, think again. Sure, low-lying countries like Bangladesh and the Maldives may be wiped off the map. But the West is not going to be spared. In 2005, hurricane Katrina killed thousands in the city of New Orleans in the U.S. Its devastation was likely accentuated by the loss of nearby wetlands which would have absorbed much of the storm\u2019s energy. In 2003, an unprecedented heat wave across Europe killed more than 50,000 people. Super hurricanes and cyclones are expected to become more common as the oceans warm up. Strong storm surges during a hurricane are expected to flood most of Manhattan, putting at risk the millions who live there.\u000a\u000aEngineers know of the phenomenon of positive feedback, where the system has a feature that accelerates the effect of something \u2014 a runaway phenomenon. The Earth\u2019s climate system has many such positive-feedback effects. One well known effect is the reflectivity of ice compared to water, known as its albedo. Ice is white and reflects the sun\u2019s energy. When it melts, it turns into dark water, which absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat, which causes more ice to melt.\u000a\u000aPoint of no return\u000a\u000aIn addition, there are many tipping points that we are aware of, points beyond which there is no return. One such example is the greenhouse gases trapped within the permafrost in places like Greenland. Most of this is in the form of methane, a gas which molecule for molecule is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide. When the permafrost melts (and it is going to melt in the near future) and all these gases are released into the atmosphere, it will cause catastrophic damage with 150 times the current rate of warming.\u000a\u000aAnd it will only go downhill from then on.\u000a\u000aWe can delude ourselves into thinking that humans are ingenious and will adapt to any change. It is true that we have learnt to live in a wide range of climatic conditions from the equator to the poles. But the global climate change we are causing represents uncharted territory for us, plus we have nowhere else to go. Every civilisation in human history has died out for one reason or another, but it has at least thrived elsewhere where the conditions were different. But there is no second Earth to go to when we make our planet uninhabitable. A sustained two-week drought in the Gangetic plain, if it comes at the wrong time, will wipe out India\u2019s food supply for hundreds of millions of people. What will we eat instead? Paper money?\u000a\u000aAs a species, we are doomed if we continue our current way of life. Humans will become extinct. And in doing this, we will take most big animals with us. But the bacteria that have lived for billions of years will not become extinct. Life on Earth will bounce back, but without humans. In the words of Iain Stewart, we are locked in a death struggle with our mother, and there is going to be only one victor, and we all know who it is.\u000a\u000aUnsustainable lifestyle\u000a\u000aThe root cause of all this is our unsustainable lifestyle. Our value system that lays so much emphasis on money and material possessions.\u000a\u000aOur dependence on fossil fuels for everything. Unless we change, we have no right to hope for a better world for our children and grandchildren.\u000a\u000aLike an ostrich, we can bury our heads in the sand and deny that the problem exists.\u000a\u000aBut it is not too late if we take responsibility now. Individually. Politicians will not do it. Kyoto, Copenhagen, Rio, are all testament to that. As individuals, we can reduce or even eliminate our carbon footprint. Replace light bulbs with CFLs in our houses. Use solar energy for heating water. Use biogas for cooking. Conserve electricity by turning off unwanted lights and appliances. Recycle water.\u000a\u000aDo something. The very survival of humankind is at stake.\u000a\u000a( The writer belongs to the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

VDhaka, June 16 (IANS) It is time for Mohammed Qader of Bahuka village in Sirajganj district to move again. For the seventh time in the last 20 years that he has been residing in Bahuka, Qader will be forced to rebuild his life from scratch as the mighty Jamuna river continues to erode its banks and destroy everything in its wake - all thanks to global warming.\u000a\u000aAccording to inhabitants of Bahuka, 110 km northwest of Bangladesh capital Dhaka, the Jamuna has swallowed 10 embankments - artificial banks built above the level of the original banks to hold back excess water - and with it all buildings built on the banks, since 1968.\u000a\u000a"This has been going on for years. The Jamuna breaches the banks throughout the year and this has accelerated in recent times," the 56-year-old Qader told a visiting IANS correspondent.\u000a\u000aMashfiqus Salehin, professor at the Institute of Water and Flood Management in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, said the constant shifting of Bahuka's residents is not uncommon since erosion is a "very big" issue in the region.\u000a\u000a"Because of the flood and erosion problems, they have to shift to a higher elevation. For an adult to shift 6 to 10 times in his lifetime is not very unusual," Salehin said.\u000a\u000aThe Jamuna, one of the main rivers of Bangladesh, has numerous criss-crossing channels. It is the main distributory of the Brahmaputra as it flows down from India to Bangladesh. Flowing south, it joins the Padma river and then merges into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna.\u000a\u000aExperts attribute the worsening erosion to the widening of the river - a phenomenon which could be a result of global warming.\u000a\u000a"If you stand here for a while you will see more and more chunks of earth falling into the river...this was not so frequent... the bigger the Jamuna gets, the more it erodes. Our school was at Chandnogor village.. now that has disappeared and the current building is at east Bahuka. Soon that will perish too," Abdus Salam, headmaster of the primary school, told IANS.\u000a\u000a"It had an average width of 8.2 km in 1975 and in 2000, that was close to 11.7 km. The Jamuna has been widening and the same thing has been happening in the upper Brahmaputra valley," Salehin noted.\u000a\u000aAtiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies (BCAS), said it was possible global warming may be playing a role in the havoc the river is causing.\u000a\u000a"There is no doubt that temperature has increased in South Asia. Somewhere it has increased by 0.8 degrees or 0.7 degrees. Due to this, an ecosystem shift has been observed too. The increase in temperature has led to glacial melting ..it may have increased the river's volume..all these factors have contributed to the erosion caused by the river," Rahman said.\u000a\u000aAccording to Sabber Ahmed of the BCAS, who works on tectonic evolution of the Jamuna since the river downstream in Bangladesh is comparatively flatter than that in upstream India, the slope lowers the velocity and results in sedimentation.\u000a\u000a"Over time this sedimentation forms bars, which are visible throughout the channel. Because of the bars, water splits and hits both banks of the river. As a result, we see excessive erosion on both banks. If we analyse satellite images, we would find that the width of the river has increased and the depth has decreased....the increase in erosion is due to this," Ahmed pointed out.\u000a\u000aFor the villagers who have adapted to this vicious cycle - by making residences out of tin and asbestos as they can be disassembled and pieced back together at another location - dams are the solution, even as the 11th embankment on the Jamuna is on its way.\u000a\u000a"We have told the government to construct dams, but they are not listening," 70-year-old Bahuka resident Hafizul asserted.\u000a\u000aHowever, Indian river expert Kalyan Rudra pointed out that instead of opting for artificial structures that are not viable, land use must be adapted according to the river's behaviour.\u000a\u000a"It's a futile exercise...it's a short term measure but doesn't sustain for the long term. Moreover, planning land use should be in line with the river's nature. But the reverse has been happening. not only in Bangladesh but in India as well," Rudra told IANS.\u000a\u000a"This type of protection is a local method guided by electoral politics. The population has gone up so much that people are encroaching upon the flood plains," Rudra added.\u000a\u000aFor headmaster Salam and his family, the clock is ticking away.\u000a\u000a"We can only hope for a miracle," he said ruefully.\u000a\u000a(Sahana ghosh can be contacted at sahana.g@ians.in)

VKOCHI: The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has assigned CDM Smith, an international agency, to carry out a detailed survey on the reduction of carbon emissions along the Kochi Metro route from 2018 to 2048.The study will give KMRL an idea about the reduction in the number of cars, two-wheelers and other passenger vehicles after the Metro begins operations. "It will give a clear picture on how the Metro will help to reduce pollution in the city. It will also help KMRL earn carbon credits," said a KMRL spokesperson.Carbon credit is a permit that gives a company the right to emit a specified amount of carbon compounds into the atmosphere. This can be purchased if emissions are expected to exceed a quota or sold if the quota is not reached. Companies can accumulate carbon credits by funding new forest or green cover. In 2011, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) received the United Nations (UN) certification for being the first rail-based Metro system in the world to receive carbon credits for fighting climate change by helping the city reduce pollution levels by 6.3 lakh tonne every year. DMRC had earned carbon credits worth Rs 47 crore, annually, for seven years. The UN body administering the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol has certified DMRC for reducing emissionsCDM Smith will also give revenue projections for the Kochi Metro and help to analyze suitable funding options for KMRL. The scope of the study would include the feasibility of the multimodal integrated approach to ticketing, whereby other means of transport such as buses, boats and rickshaws and the like are a part of the integrated ticketing system.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aKochi Metro Rail Limited has assigned CDM Smith to carry out a survey to assess the expected reduction in carbon emissions along the metro alignment from 2018 to 2048. The study will give an idea about the expected reduction in number of cars, two-wheelers and other vehicles following the metro\u2019s commissioning and the resultant fall in pollution. This would help KMRL earn carbon credits, said the agency\u2019s spokesperson in a release.\u000a\u000aCDM Smith is also conducting a study for the projection of revenue pattern to help identify a suitable funding option for the project.\u000a\u000aThe scope also includes a study about multimodal integrated approach, involving the metro rail, buses, boats, autos. The possibility of introducing integrated ticketing for these modes of transport too will be probed.

VBarack Obama (centre) meets Richard (left) and Jeff Heil and their farm in Haverhill, Iowa last August. The US President touted his new climate change proposal in his weekly address Saturday, calling for Americans to lead the charge against the warming environment\u000a\u000aUS President Barack Obama touted his new climate change proposal in his weekly address Saturday, calling for Americans to lead the charge against the warming environment.\u000a\u000a"Those who already feel the effects of a changing climate don't have time to deny it -- they're busy dealing with it," said Obama in his pre-recorded address on radio and the Internet.\u000a\u000a"The firefighters who brave longer wildfire seasons. The farmers who see crops wilted one year, and washed away the next. Western families worried about water that's drying up.\u000a\u000a"The cost of these events can be measured in lost lives and livelihoods, lost homes and businesses, and hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services and disaster relief. And Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction in higher food costs, insurance premiums, and the tab for rebuilding.\u000a\u000a"The question is not whether we need to act. The question is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late," the president said.\u000a\u000aObama laid out a broad new plan to fight climate change on Tuesday, using executive powers to get around deniers who have blocked action in Congress. He called for new restrictions on existing and new power plants to curb carbon emissions, pledged to push new generation clean energy sources and to lead a fresh global effort to stem global warming.\u000a\u000a"This is the fight America can and will lead in the 21st century. But it will require all of us, as citizens, to do our part," the president said Saturday, calling for scientists to develop biofuels and farmers to grow them, engineers to design clean technology and businesses to get them to market.\u000a\u000a"We will be judged -- as a people, as a society, and as a country -- on where we go from here," Obama said.\u000a\u000aSome opponents of his approach have warned that the plan could result in older coal-fired plants being taken offline and may thereby raise electricity prices for consumers, which could disproportionately hurt the poor.\u000a\u000aOfficials counter that the plan will reduce the amount of electricity used -- thereby reducing fuel bills.\u000a\u000aHowever, the specifics of much of his plan were unclear, and many of Obama's new rules could face court challenges that would delay their implementation.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, speaking for Republicans on another contentious issue, Senator Pat Roberts from Kansas raised concerns over the health care reform package Obama championed in his first term.\u000a\u000aThe Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012, aims to provide health care coverage to an additional 30 million Americans. States are to implement it gradually by 2014.\u000a\u000aBut many Republicans remain staunchly opposed.\u000a\u000a"As we celebrate the 4th (of July Independence Day holiday), it will be a mere 89 days until the October 1st deadline, when millions of Americans are forced to purchase health insurance in a special marketplace ... overseen by the federal government," Roberts said.\u000a\u000a"Health care as you know it will change," he warned, suggesting many aspects including cost, coverage, and side effects were still unknown.\u000a\u000aRoberts has proposed a law that would repeal the marketplaces, as well as other provisions related to the mandate to buy insurance, if the Obama administration misses its deadline.

VMUMBAI: If Metro-III, the city's third 33.5km underground rail link between\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000a, chugs off by 2020, over 4.60\u000a\u000aand 6.65\u000a\u000avehicle trips of\u000a\u000awill be saved daily and fuel worth around\u000a\u000a1.60\u000a\u000aand\u000a\u000a2.30\u000a\u000awill also be saved by 2021 and 2041 respectively.\u000a\u000aderived the figures after calculating the expected rise in vehicles and commuters, and the shift of ridership to the third metro\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000aColabaSeepzlakhlakhMumbaikarsRscroreRscroreThis will help the city fetch lakhs of rupees daily as carbon credit for saving carbon emission, officials said.The third metro, with 27 stations, received the all-important Union government nod for funding from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Thursday.A state government study, suggesting the prospective impact of Metro-III, and carried out with help from Indian Railways, estimated that if the project is up and running by 2021 it will save total 4.60 lakh vehicular journeys on the roads made by cars, taxis, buses and autorickshaws. Similarly by 2031 and 2041 such 5.55 lakh and 6.65 lakh journeys will reduce on the city's roads. The figures have been"The Metro will reduce 55 lakh km, 67 lakh km and 81 lakh km of daily journeys of vehicles by 2021, 2031 and 2041 respectively. It will ultimately reduce consumption of fuel worth Rs1.60 crore, Rs1.92 crore and Rs2.30 crore daily," the findings suggested."Ultimately, reduction in emission of toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulate matter will reduce the city's air pollution. It will eventually help fetch carbon credit worth over Rs28 lakh, Rs34 lakh and Rs41 lakh everyday in 2021, 2031 and 2041 respectively," it stated. Mantralaya officials said the city would not need to buy 450 buses if the Metro comes up by 2020. "Similarly, around 10% newer roads of 182km length planned for Mumbai, will not be required," the report added.The Union urban development ministry had on June 20 withdrawn a proposal on the Metro-III from the Cabinet. Sources said he found a typographical error in the project cost. The figure circulated at the meeting was less than the estimated cost.

V: Close on the heels of the state government announcing an eco-friendly policy to set up a Solar Net Metering System\u000a\u000a) on the lines of European countries to tackle the power crisis, all the four power distribution companies are now gearing up to implement\u000a\u000ain a bid to plug the daily demand and supply gap.\u000a\u000aVISAKHAPATNAMSNMSSNMSThe state government officially released GO MS No 27 a week ago instructing all the state discoms to work on SNMS, which will be provided to interested domestic and non-domestic consumers to generate solar power for self-consumption as well as feed the excess power into the grids of the respective discoms.The four discoms - Visakhapatnam-based Eastern Power Distribution Company of AP Limited (EPDCL), Hyderabad based Central Power Distribution Company of AP Limited (CPDCL), Warangal based Northern Power Distribution Company of AP Limited (NPDCL) and Tirupati based Southern Power Distribution Company of AP Limited (SPDCL) \u2014 currently have nearly 3 crore domestic and non-domestic consumers.All the officer rank staff of the five operation circles of EPDCL have already been informed about SNMS and been asked to work on the project and organize awareness camps as part of the programme, said an officer.When contacted, Kartikeya Misra chairman and managing director, NPDCL and in-charge CMD of EPDCL, said that SNMS is currently in the initial stages. "The guidelines such as safety precautions, metering designs, billing procedure are being discussed now. Once the guidelines are released, the project is likely to be rolled out," Misra said, without disclosing the timelines for the rollout.To begin with, an SNMS with an installed capacity of 100 kW solar plant has already been installed on a pilot basis at the Vidyut Soudha at Hyderabad by Transmission Corporation of AP Limited (APTRANSCO). Based on the results of the pilot unit, APTRANSCO has mooted implementation of SNMS facility for the domestic and industrial consumers keen on setting up solar plants at their untilised places on rooftops, waste lands, buildings of individual households, industries, offices, institutions, residential complexes."SNMS is nothing but a power generation system where even ordinary electricity consumers can generate power on their own sell the surplus power to discoms to which they are connected. However, the price per unit is yet to be decided by discoms after consultating with the government," a senior EPDCL officer explained.While quoting the recently issued GO, another EPDCL officer explained that surplus energy injected by the SNMS owner will be considered for payment by the discoms concerned at a pooled cost as may be decided by the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulation Commission for that year. The payment of pooled cost will be made effective for a period of seven years from the date of establishment of the SNMS and the settlement of the registered surplus energy will be carried out on a half-yearly basis, he added.The Centre through the New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP) will give a subsidy of up to 30% of the cost of the solar panel up to a capacity of 3 kW while the state government will extend its financial support for another 20% of the cost for domestic consumers."The government's rate of setting up a 1KW solar panel is about Rs 2.1 lakh. On an average, a two-bedroom house having basic electrical appliances such as LED lights, laptops, fans and LED television sets can easily save nearly 1.5 kW of power per day if they take the 3 kW SNMS that which generates 540 units of power per month," NREDCAP manager, Visakhapatnam, PR Ramaraju said.

VNEW DELHI: After its last project of installing clean toilets in its building drew considerable flak, Planning Commission now wishes to go green. But it\u2019s playing safe this time, and unlike the Rs 35-lakh toilet renovation scheme, the commission doesn\u2019t intend to spend money from its pocket on its new venture.Trying to set up an example for other government organisations, the commission is retrofitting the Yojana Bhawan to convert it into a 5-star energy-efficient building, complying with BEE\u2019s (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) standards.It has also requested the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) to set up a 150-kw solar rooftop power plant. \u201cConstructed several years ago, government buildings are major guzzlers of power.There is resistance in the government sector against energy efficiency because it is commercial in nature. So, we decided to come up with a model that will help us go green without spending any extra money,\u201d said AK Jain, advisor (Energy), Planning Commission. On the directions of the commission, BEE has roped in an Energy Service Company (ESCO) to do a baseline study of energy use of the building.On its basis, it will retrofit the building with energy-efficient equipment such as super-efficient fans, low-watt LEDs and air conditioners, double gaze windows and motion sensors, etc. The difference in the amount of electricity bill, pre and post retrofitting, would be paid to ESCO.The current energy usage of Yojana Bhawan is 850 kwh per annum. Through this initiative, the commission is trying to reduce its power takeoff from the grid by 33%.

VOne in 10 people around the world will live in a place where climate change is damaging at least two major sectors such as crop yields, water, ecosystems or health, said an international study today.\u000a\u000aThese so-called climate "hotspots" will be most widespread in the southern Amazon, with "severe changes" in water availability, yields and ecosystems, said the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a US journal.\u000a\u000aThe second largest hotspot region is southern Europe, where water shortages and crop failures would lead to hardships for the population, said the study led by Franziska Piontek of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\u000a\u000a"Overlapping impacts of climate change in different sectors have the potential to interact and thus multiply pressure on the livelihoods of people in the affected regions," said Piontek.\u000a\u000aThe study included climate impact researchers from Japan, the United States, China, and beyond, and used mathematical modeling programs to project how global warming will change the livelihoods of people around the planet.\u000a\u000aDifferent levels of warming were analysed, with multi-sector overlap beginning to appear "robustly" at an average warming worldwide of three degrees Celsius above the 1980-2010 average, it said.\u000a\u000aWhen that figure was raised to four degrees Celsius above the 1980-2010 average, 11 per cent of the world's population was "subject to severe impacts in at least two of the four impact sectors," it said.\u000a\u000aOther hotspots included tropical regions of Central America and Africa, as well as the Ethiopian highlands because of the overlapping pressures of malarial spread, suffering crops and ecosystem changes.\u000a\u000aNorthern regions of south Asia were also predicted to suffer because of crop woes combined with either ecosystem changes or water availability.\u000a\u000a"What today is considered extreme could become the new normal," said co-author Qiuhong Tang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000aThe analysis found no place on Earth where all four sectors would experience a severe change.\u000a\u000aMuch of Africa, which might be considered a vulnerable part of the planet, did not appear as a hotspot under the model methods used. However, the case might be different if droughts and floods were included as metrics, the authors said.\u000a\u000aResearchers said the data should help nations plan for significant changes in the decades ahead, either by speeding adaptation strategies or motivating decisions to curb climate change.\u000a\u000a"It allows for a risk management perspective," said co-author Alex Ruane of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\u000a\u000a"In the hotspot parts of Africa, for instance, even small temperature rises can lead to additional losses that many small farmers simply cannot afford.

VSea levels may rise by about 2.3 meters for each degree celsius of global warming within the next 2,000 years, an international team of researchers has said.\u000a\u000aWhile thermal expansion of the ocean and melting mountain glaciers are the most important factors causing sea-level changes today, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will be the dominant contributors within the next two millennia, according to the team's findings published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000aHalf of that rise might come from ice loss in Antarctica, which is currently contributing less than 10 percent to the global sea-level rise, Xinhua cited the report as saying.\u000a\u000a"We're confident that our estimate is robust because of the combination of physics and data that we use," Anders Levermann, lead author of the study and research domain co-chair at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research based in Germany, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe team said the study is the first to combine evidence from early Earth's climate history with comprehensive computer simulations using physical models of all four major contributors to long-term global sea-level rise.\u000a\u000aExperts from the US, Spain, Canada and Austria also contributed to the research.\u000a\u000aIf global mean temperature rises by four degrees celsius compared to pre-industrial times, which is projected to happen within less than a century, the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute about 50 percent of sea-level rise over the next two millennia, the team said.\u000a\u000aGreenland will add another 25 percent to the total sea-level rise, while the thermal expansion of the oceans' water, currently the largest component of sea-level rise, will contribute about 20 percent.\u000a\u000aThe contribution from mountain glaciers will decline to less than five percent, mostly because many of them will shrink to a minimum, the team added.\u000a\u000a"Continuous sea-level rise is something we cannot avoid unless global temperatures go down again," said Levermann.\u000a\u000a"Thus we can be absolutely certain that we need to adapt ... it is inevitable and therefore highly relevant for almost everything we build along our coastlines, for many generations to come."

Some responsible companies are taking concrete steps to just not to reduce their emission, but also reduce it to zero.Against this backdrop, His Excellency Dr APJ Abdul Kalam , former President of India, has called on the industry to evolve new energy utilisation norms for different industries and challenge designers to work towards sustainability targets, in the mission to make companies, communities and the country green.Dr Kalam was speaking at the CII 's GreenCo Summit 2013 organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at Pune. "21st century companies will have unique challenges of maximising the output, human resources and machinery with minimum clean water availability and with minimum clean air and maximum fossil fuel driven electricity. That calls for visionary decisions for solar and wind powered company and generation of water bodies inside the company."He concluded by exhorting industry leaders to move towards the vision of a 'Livable Planet Earth', as the next common goal for the world as a whole.

VDriving through colonies in Bangalore, one would spot solar water heaters on every roof. A walk down the streets of Gandhinagar in Gujarat would show that every house wears a solar hat. And now, Chennai is waking up to solar, albeit slowly. The everlasting power crunch is driving several of the city\u2019s residents to look at the sun for power from rooftop solar energy systems.Distributed or rooftop solar power , experts say, is the best approach as there would be no loss in transmission from power plants to houses. Officials from Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA), the state nodal agency that drives adoption of renewable energy sources, said the government has received applications for 546 kilowatt (kw) from Chennai, which means that about 550 households have evinced interest in going solar (assuming that every household sets up a 1kw system which would suit an average household\u2019s needs).A 1kw system costs between Rs1.5 lakh and Rs1.8 lakh, and since adoption of such systems isn\u2019t economically viable, the state government has announced incentives for households that choose to set up rooftop solar energy systems under the state\u2019s solar policy.The policy also mandates commercial establishments to procure a part of their energy requirement from solar sources, and the government is leading by example with several government buildings setting up solar energy systems on their rooftops. The TEDA office was the first to have a rooftop system. The secretariat, Raj Bhavan and the corporation will each get 30kw systems.Several private entities have set up solar energy systems: D G Vaishnav College set up a 100kw system. Economist House, a publisher, set up a 25kw system at Guindy, and Scope International, Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s BPO, has a 100kw system on its roofs. But the adoption across residential and commercial establishments is anything but ubiquitous. Several malls and office buildings are yet to set up systems, despite being mandated to procure 3% of power from the sun by the year end.The government policy is out, but action is yet to be taken on implementation. For instance, it promises generationbased incentives and capital subsidies for houses with rooftop systems, but there is no word on how these will come through. Even for systems that have been set up, subsidies haven\u2019t been passed on.\u201cThe electricity regulatory commission is holding public hearings and guidelines will be out soon,\u201d Sudeep Jain, chairman and managing director of TEDA, said.

VFarming has never been easy. Farmers have to face a host of challenges, the most difficult of which is dealing with the uncertainties of nature.\u000a\u000aIn the current global scenario, climate change is adding to their woes. The solution lies in promoting farming techniques which will help farmers in adapting to the changing climate without reducing their agricultural income.\u000a\u000aDr.Nishi Rai, a scientist working at the KrishiVigyan Kendra asserts, "In the arid and semi - arid belts, we should opt for drought resistant and short duration seed varieties that are less vulnerable to climate change. For example swarna and poorna varieties of wheat use less water and grow in less timeand so are more suitable for drought prone areas."\u000a\u000aAlong with climate resilient crop varieties, organic farming, water efficient irrigation techniques, line sowing, dry sowing etc. are other sustainable agricultural practices that farmers need to adopt to reduce their vulnerability to climate change as well as save resources.\u000a\u000a"If you opt for sprinkler irrigation system or drip irrigation in your fields, it saves up to 30 to 40 percent water," said S.B.Pandey, an agricultural scientist working with Development Alternatives - an organisation working to promote natural resource management in Bundelkhand, one of Central India's most climate sensitive regions.\u000a\u000aGreen shade nets that help in temperature control for germination of seedlings also need to be promoted to help farmers grow cash crops like vegetables to increase their adaptive capacities.\u000a\u000aThese sustainable farming techniques can help farmers across all dry, drought prone regions of India to build their resilience to withstand the impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aMr.K.R.Viswanathan, Deputy Head, Climate Change and Development Division, Embassy of Switzerland while talking of the way forward, said: "What is important is to ensure that these agricultural technologies get properly mainstreamed and integrated into state level policies, programs and budgets in order to achieve climate resilient development in India.

VSHILLONG: The Centre is all set to tie up with the\u000a\u000a, a German government-owned development bank, for implementation of a project relating to addressing climate change and its impact in the northeastern states, including\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000aKFWMeghalaya"We are still waiting to sign the agreement with the ministry of DoNER," KFW natural resources management project manager, Sangeeta Agarwal , said. She added that the government will start implementing the project once the agreement is signed.According to a study done in 2011, the entire northeast is highly vulnerable to climate change and it is expected that temperatures would increase by 3-4 degrees centigrade by 2085, Agarwal said, adding that the rainfall precipitation will also increase in this region by 20- 25 per cent."So there will be more soil erosion. The agricultural crop pattern has to be changed. It has to be based on the rainfall pattern," Agarwal said. The study also reveals that there is going to be greater "water stress" in the northeast, she added."Basically, all these things imply that you have to plan for your water resources in a much more sustainable manner and you have to look at this with a long term perspective," she emphasized.Villages will have to be identified for implementation of the project. "The selection of the villages will be based on vulnerability based on analytical study," she said, while informing that the most vulnerable districts have already been identified."Seventy-two villages have identified in the NE and all districts of Meghalaya except the Jaintia Hills will be under the project," Agarwal informed.She expressed hope that the project would kick off by next year.

VTHIRUMAYAM: Observing that climate change has become an urgent concern across the globe, Prime Minister Manmohan singh today said ways and means should be developed to reduce India's carbon footprint as it would be among the nations to be "most seriously" impacted."We need to develop ways and means to reduce our carbon foot-print through technological innovation. In our country, more than 50 per cent of power comes from coal-based generation, which is a major emitter of greenhouse gases," he said.Dedicating to the nation public sector BHEL 's Power Plant Piping Unit & Unit-II High Pressure Boiler Plant in this town near Tiruchirappalli, Singh expressed happiness over BHEL's initiatives for development of ultra super critical technology in line "with our mission for development of clean coal technologies."He said the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar mission seeks to develop 20,000 mw of power generating capacity by the end of 13th five Year plan, adding its success has the potential of enhancing India's energy security, and "contributing handsomely to our efforts to combat climate change.""I sincerely hope that BHEL, which is bestowed with engineering expertise, manufacturing prowess and a commendable human resource base, will not only take the lead in solar energy in terms of power generation but also in the development of solar power technology in India."This is a difficult commercial decision, but well worth taking in the long term interest of our country," he said.

VRate of climate change over the next century will be 10 times faster than the rate of any climate shift in the past 65 million years. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aThe likely rate of climate change over the next century will be 10 times faster than in the past 65 million years, the largest since dinosaurs went extinct, a new study has warned.\u000a\u000aResearchers said if the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems, and many species will need to make behavioural, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive.\u000a\u000aAlthough some of the changes the planet will experience in the next few decades are already "baked into the system," how different the climate looks at the end of the 21st century will depend largely on how humans respond.\u000a\u000aResearchers Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, both senior fellows at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, conducted targeted but broad review of scientific literature on aspects of climate change that can affect ecosystems, and investigated how recent observations and projections for the next century compare to past events in Earth's history.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the planet experienced a 5 degree Celsius hike in temperature 20,000 years ago, as Earth emerged from the last ice age. This is a change comparable to the high-end of the projections for warming over the 20th and 21st centuries, researchers said.\u000a\u000aThe geologic record shows that, 20,000 years ago, as the ice sheet that covered much of North America receded northward, plants and animals recolonised areas that had been under ice. As the climate continued to warm, those plants and animals moved northward, to cooler climes.\u000a\u000a"We know from past changes that ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of global temperature change over thousands of years," said Diffenbaugh.\u000a\u000a"But the unprecedented trajectory that we're on now is forcing that change to occur over decades. That's orders of magnitude faster, and we're already seeing that some species are challenged by that rate of change," he said.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Islamists rally in Egypt ahead of referendum vote, 3 killed\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VINDORE: Solar power generating firms in\u000a\u000aPradesh are on a mission to reduce poisonous\u000a\u000acarbon dioxide\u000a\u000athrough their ongoing projects. The 25 MW grid connected solar photovoltaic (PV) power project by\u000a\u000aEnergy Ltd (\u000a\u000a), which is under implementation in\u000a\u000adistrict of\u000a\u000aPradesh, is expected to avoid emissions of 37,739 metric\u000a\u000aof\u000a\u000acarbon dioxide\u000a\u000aannually for a period of 21 years into earth's atmosphere.\u000a\u000acarbon dioxide\u000a\u000aMadhyaWelspunWELNeemuchMadhyatonnesThe project has been included in registered programme of activities (PoA). Total investment in the project under construction is likely to be at around Rs 1,200 crore. Waaree Energee is another solar power project, which is also working towards that end.Welspun Renewable Energy Programme, run by WEL, has been registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) effective from November 19, 2012 as a CDM (clean development mechanism) PoA. Also, it is the first dual scale PoA of the country, which includes both, large and small scale CDM projects.The CDM allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries like India to earn carbon emission reductions (CERs) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of. These CERs can be used by industrialized countries to meet part of their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto protocol.A programme of activity (PoA) under the CDM makes it possible to register the coordinated implementation of a policy, measure or goal that leads to emission reductions. Registering PoA compared to the conventional CDM project is a challenging and lengthy process.Talking to ToI, co-founder and managing director of WEL, Vineet Mittal, said, "Most of approvals for the project have already come."Waaree Energee is another firm which has also registered itself for CDM. The firm has already invested Rs 100 crore on two solar power projects, each having a capacity of 5 MW in Susner near Aagar in the state. However, firm MD Hitesh Doshi said, "We are looking for further investment of Rs 100 crore for installation of an additional plant with a capacity of 12 MW."

VExpress News Service By\u000a\u000aLaying out ways to tackle climate change problems, R K Pachauri said that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone, but adoption of both will help in handling challenges posed by climate change, and added that if people enforce environment conservation as an election agenda, then politicians will take up the issue of climate problem.\u000a\u000aPachauri, director general, The Energy Research Institute (TERI) was speaking at a lecture titled \u2018Dealing with Challenge of Climate Change and Sustainable Development\u2019 organised by the Centre of Gandhian Economic Thought, University of Hyderabad (UoH) in the University premises on Friday.\u000a\u000aHe observed that often most disadvantaged people suffer because of environmental degradation though they contribute little to the problem and added that natural disasters will claim more lives in developing countries than developed countries.\u000a\u000aAddressing students and staff of UoH, Padma Vibhushan recipient, Pachauri informed that mitigation of climate change will have co-benefits like higher energy security due to the use of renewable energy sources and stressed that educational institutions have great power in bringing about changes in thinking and finding new paradigms of growth which will be useful not only for this generation but also for coming generations.\u000a\u000aPachauri pointed out that climate change will have a major impact on human health, where diseases are going to last for a long time. Increase in malnutrition cases and death-causing diseases can be observed. He further stated that half a billion people depending on glacial melt for water supply will be affected as rapid melting of glaciers results in flow of rivers which leads to a water resource problem and added that an increase in sea level to 17 cm indicates the threat to stable and sustainable existence.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about degree of implementation of environmental rules in India, Pachauri said \u201cIndia has good national action plan for environment, however I have questions about its implementation. In several parts of the country, established rules are not being implemented properly. We need more rigorous ways of implementation\u201d.\u000a\u000aRegarding the minimal use of technology for sustainable development like hybrid cars in India, he said that it needs huge infrastructure, network and export market for implementation of those technologies. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy, vice-chancellor of UoH, Aloka Parasher Sen, dean, School of Social Sciences were also present at the lecture.

VWASHINGTON: Increasingly warmer and drier climate is pushing plant species to higher elevations on a southern Arizona mountain, scientists say.Comparing plant communities today with a survey taken 50 years ago, University of Arizona-led research provides the first on-the-ground evidence for Southwestern plants being pushed to higher elevations by climate change The findings confirm that previous hypotheses are correct in their prediction that mountain communities in the Southwest will be strongly impacted by an increasingly warmer and drier climate, and that the area is already experiencing rapid vegetation change."Our study provides the first on-the-ground proof of plants being forced significantly upslope due to climate warming in southern Arizona," said Richard C Brusca, lead researcher."If climate continues to warm, as the climate models predict, the subalpine mixed conifer forests on the tops of the mountains - and the animals dependent upon them - could be pushed right off the top and disappear," said Brusca.The study was made possible by the existence of a dataset compiled 50 years ago by Robert H Whittaker, often referred to as the "father of modern plant ecology," and his colleague, William Niering, who catalogued the plants they encountered along the Catalina Highway.Focusing on the 27 most abundantly catalogued plant species, Brusca and colleagues discovered that three quarters of them have shifted their range significantly upslope, in some cases as much as a thousand feet, or now grow in a narrower elevation range compared to where Whittaker and Niering found them in 1963.Wendy Moore, an assistant professor in the UA's department of entomology found that the lowermost boundaries for 15 of the species studied have moved upslope; eight of those species now first appear more than 800 feet higher than where Whittaker and Niering first encountered them.Sixteen of the studied species are now restricted to a narrower band of elevation, the researchers noticed.According to researchers the main point emerging from the study is that plant communities on the mountain were different 50 years ago because plant species do not necessarily move toward higher elevations as a community.The study was published in the journal Ecology and Evolution.

VCooling waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean appear to be a major factor in dampening global warming in recent years, scientists said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aTheir work is a big step forward in helping to solve the greatest puzzle of current climate change research \u2013 why global average surface temperatures, while still on an upward trend, have risen more slowly in the past 10 to fifteen years than previously.\u000a\u000aWaters in the eastern tropical regions of the Pacific have been notably cooler in recent years, owing to the effects of one of the world's biggest ocean circulatory systems, the Pacific decadal oscillation.\u000a\u000aMany people are aware of the El Nio and La Nia weather systems, which affect the Pacific and bring hotter and stormier or cooler weather in cycles of just a few years, and can have a strong effect on global weather. But few are aware that both of these systems are just part of the much bigger Pacific decadal oscillation, which brings warmer and cooler weather over decades.\u000a\u000aThe system is now in a cooling phase, scientists have noted, which could last for years. The last such phase was from the 1940s to the 1970s.\u000a\u000aGlobal temperature rise Photograph: Guardian\u000a\u000aThe new study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and supported by the US government's National Oceans and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), published in the journal Nature, has linked the "pause" in global warming with the Pacific oscillation.\u000a\u000aDan Barrie, programme manager at NOAA, called the research "compelling" and said: "[It] provides a powerful illustration of how the remote eastern tropical Pacific guides the behaviour of the global ocean-atmosphere system, in this case exhibiting a discernible influence on the recent hiatus in global warming."\u000a\u000aIn winter, the effect of the cooler phase of the oscillation on the northern hemisphere is to depress temperatures slightly; but in summer, the cooler waters in the equatorial Pacific have less impact on the northern hemisphere's weather. The scientists, using computer models, compared their results with observations and concluded that global average annual temperatures have been lower than they would otherwise have been because of the oscillation. But the observed higher summer temperatures of recent years show more of the true effects of global warming, according to the research. Global average temperatures are taken over the whole year, obscuring the effect of this seasonal variation.\u000a\u000aShang-Ping Xie, professor of environmental science at Scripps, said: "In summer, the equatorial Pacific's grip on the northern hemisphere loosens, and the increased greenhouse gases continue to warm temperatures, causing record heat waves and unprecedented Arctic sea ice retreat."\u000a\u000aDr Alex Sen Gupta, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not part of the study team, said: "The authors have set up some elegant experiments using a climate model to test whether a natural oscillation that has gone through a large swing in the tropical Pacific Ocean over the last decade can explain the recent halt in surface global warming \u2026 the new simulation accurately reproduces the timing and pattern of changes that have occurred over the last four decades with remarkable skill. This clearly shows that the recent slowdown is a consequence of a natural oscillation."\u000a\u000aThe role of oceans in regulating the planet's temperatures has taken on a greater significance in climate change research, as not enough is yet known about how ocean currents and the circulation of warmer surface water to the deep oceans below affect the weather and climate.\u000a\u000aResearch indicates that oceans have absorbed much of the heat and about a third of the additional carbon dioxide pumped into the air from pre-industrial times. This has an effect \u2013 the thermal expansion of the oceans is likely to be the biggest factor behind sea level rise, and the absorption of carbon dioxide is making the oceans more acidic.\u000a\u000aScientists also think that the circulation of heat from the top layers of the ocean, which have been most affected to date, to the deeper oceans below may be another factor behind the "hiatus" in global warming. What the full effects of this exchange of energy may be, particularly on ocean currents, is not yet known.\u000a\u000aResearchers have called for more observations of the ocean, including many more buoys and underwater readings.\u000a\u000aThe slowdown in the upward march of global average temperatures has been greeted by climate sceptics as evidence that the climate is less affected by greenhouse gases than thought. But climate scientists are much more cautious, pointing out that the trend is still upwards, and that the current temperature rises are well within the expected range. Past temperature records and computer predictions both show that periods of slower rises are to be expected as part of the natural variability of the planet's climate.\u000a\u000aThese issues are likely to be a major focus of the forthcoming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body of scientists who produce the most authoritative and comprehensive summaries of climate research. Their eagerly awaited fifth report, seven years since the last, will be published next month. It is likely to affirm that scientists are more certain than ever \u2013 at least 95%, up from 90% previously \u2013 that climate change is happening and is mostly caused by human actions, but it may suggest that the climate is slightly less sensitive to carbon than some outlying research has posited. That may mean that some of the highest estimates of future temperature rises, of more than 6C within several decades, are less likely, but it does not let the world off the hook \u2013 warming of more than 2C is still highly likely on current high emissions trends, and that would cause severe consequences around the world.\u000a\u000aA discussion of the recent "hiatus" in temperature rises, and its causes, will form an important part of the IPCC report. However, as the main source papers for the IPCC had to be gathered some time ago, the Scripps-led study of the Pacific decadal oscillation will not have made it into the final report, the first part of which will be presented at a meeting in Stockholm next month.\u000a\u000aThe Scripps research team said the current cooling phase in the Pacific began just after a strong El Nio year in 1998, but that it was not possible to predict when it might end.\u000a\u000aThey arrived at the conclusion by using innovative computer modeling methods to simulate regional patterns of climate anomalies. This enabled them to see global warming in greater spatial detail, revealing where it has been most intense and where there has been no warming or even cooling.\u000a\u000aThey developed new computer models that could show regional and seasonal variations in temperature, as well as global patterns. "Climate models consider anthropogenic forcings like greenhouse gases and tiny atmospheric particles known as aerosols, but they cannot study a specific climate event like the current hiatus," said Yu Kosaka, co-author of the Nature paper. "We devised a new method for climate models to take equatorial Pacific ocean temperatures as an additional input."\u000a\u000aWhen these were taken into account, the models predicted the temperature changes observed, including the current "hiatus" in the upward climb of temperatures.\u000a\u000aThe scientists warned, however, that when the current cooling phase turns, the upward march of temperatures is likely to resume, perhaps at faster rates than before as greenhouse gas emission rates are higher.\u000a\u000aXie said: "We don't know precisely when we're going to come out of [the hiatus] but we know that over the timescale of several decades, the climate will continue to warm as we pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."\u000a\u000aSome of the effects of the cooling in the Pacific are not straightforward \u2013 drier temperatures in the US midwest are one of the associated results.\u000a\u000aDuring the last cool phase, warmer, drier weather dominated in the midwestern US, as it has in the past 15 years with a serious drought prevailing through much of the region for much of the time.

VMUMBAI: Mumbai air space is all set to handle green flights or user preferred routes (\u000a\u000a) flights. The city's Air Traffic Control (\u000a\u000a) will be equipped to allow part of its air space for green flights which reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.\u000a\u000ais a unique preferred route which is marked on the basis of wind conditions, aircraft type and the weather.\u000a\u000aHow the UPR works\u000a\u000aUPRATCUPRIt is not a pre-defined point-to-point path like other routes but helps achieving the best speed and reduces fuel consumption. Airports in the North Atlantic and Pacific region are already able to use part of their air space for UPR flights. In Asia-Pacific region, Mumbai, Chennai, Colombo and Melbourne air space will be used from October.The Airports Authority of India has worked with other airports to use satellite data information to handle the UPR flights, said officials. The flights would cruise at an altitude of 28,000-46,000 ft like other aircraft. But unlike others, they will have an independent flight plan instead of a fixed one (which most flights adhere to). Trials for the use of routes in Mumbai's air space were on since June last year and concluded in February. Airlines like Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways participated. "Now, it is open to any airline which wants to use this route. Most users would be foreign carriers as Indian carriers are not yet equipped with the technology to use UPR," said A B Joshi, nodal officer of the project in Mumbai.The routes would be used by aircraft which are fitted with a planning system. It can chart a flight path while the aircraft is still on ground, on the basis of weather conditions. "Routes and levels are same. But conducive winds help the aircraft cruise faster. This cuts time and burns less fuel," said an official. "These conditions aren't usually taken into account normally for pre-designated flight routes," he added.Officials said UPR routes are laid for long-haul flights that include traversing oceans.As per estimates from trial more than 1,000 trial flights, around 219 tonnes of fuel was saved. The approximate carbon emission saving was 6,885 tonnes. "This is why these routes are called green routes. The ATC role becomes more complex as they are also handling these flights along with the routine ones as standard separations have to be maintained. The trials have ensured that all loopholes have been smoothened," said an airport official.The UPR is derived from a specialized system fitted in an aircraft.On ground, weather details are fed into the system. On the basis of the information, the aircraft devices a flights path taking into consideration wind conditions and the traffic around.When the aircraft moves along the wind, its speed increases, thereby reducing the time taken and the fuel consumed.UPR will help reduce fuel consumption per flight.It will reduce the time taken, depending upon the winds.As per estimates during trials:1013 flight were operated using UPR.Approx fuel saving 218 tonnesApprox carbon emissions saving: 6,885 tonnes.

VMUMBAI: On July 22, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) issued a landmark order for enforcement of Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) in the State. The Commission has ordered 93 Obligated Entities, mostly heavy power guzzlers such as industries and suppliers, in Maharashtra to demonstrate compliance to RPO targets for 4 years (from FY 2010-11 to FY 2013-14 cumulatively) by 31st March 2014 or face requisite fines that could be as high as ?13.40/unit.\u000a\u000aThis order is the strongest initiative to date towards enforcement of RPOs by any Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) in the country. The order assumes even greater significance given that Maharashtra is amongst the largest energy producing and consuming States in India and is considered to set industry benchmarks which are adopted by other ERCs by March 2014. The Obligated Entities currently named in the order will be required to add approximately 400 MW of solar capacity in Maharashtra.\u000a\u000aReacting to the announcement Astonfield Co-Chairman Ameet Shah said, "This announcement is a fundamental game changer for the Indian solar industry. RPOs are essential to installing more power; alleviating shortages and helping our economy run at full speed. The State of Maharashtra, one of the leading industrial states in the country, making such a big policy move towards enforcement confirms explicitly that the pricing for solar is now within an acceptable range for all users and non-compliance will not be tolerated any longer. The significance of this Order is that such enforcement will lead to a sustained demand for solar powerthrough 2022 when the Solar RPO target is confirmed at 3% for all consumers. Moreover, it is expected that this initial list will expand at least 4-5 times in the coming year, correspondingly multiplying the market opportunity. The estimated total size for solar in India based on this policy is approximately 35,000 MW."

VNEW DELHI: Crop pests are spreading to colder parts of the world as climate change warms the world, a new study has revealed. It used published observations of the distribution of 612 crop pests collected over the past 50 years. It revealed that the movement of pests north and south towards the poles, and into new previously un-colonized regions, corresponds to increased temperatures during that period.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change and carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford, shows a strong relationship between increased global temperatures over the past 50 years and expansion in the range of crop pests. It said that the pests are moving onwards at a rate of nearly 3 km a year.\u000a\u000a""If crop pests continue to march polewards as the Earth warms the combined effects of a growing world population and the increased loss of crops to pests will pose a serious threat to global food security,"" said Dr Dan Bebber from the University of Exeter.\u000a\u000aCurrently 10-16% of global crop production is lost to pests. Crop pests include fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, nematodes, viroids and oomycetes. The diversity of crop pests continues to expand and new strains are continually evolving. Losses of major crops to fungi, and fungi-like microorganisms, amount to enough to feed nearly nine percent of today's global population. The study suggests that these figures will increase further if global temperatures continue to rise as predicted.\u000a\u000aThe spread of pests is caused by both human activities and natural processes but is thought to be primarily the result of international freight transportation. The study suggests that the warming climate is allowing pests to become established in previously unsuitable regions. For example, warming generally stimulates insect herbivory at higher latitudes as seen in outbreaks of the Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) that has destroyed large areas of pine forest in the US Pacific Northwest. In addition, the rice blast fungus which is present in over 80 countries, and has a dramatic effect both on the agricultural economy and ecosystem health, has now moved to wheat. Considered a new disease, wheat blast is sharply reducing wheat yields in Brazil.\u000a\u000a""Renewed efforts are required to monitor the spread of crop pests and to control their movement from region to region if we are to halt the relentless destruction of crops across the world in the face of climate change,"" Professor Sarah Gurr from the University of Exeter (previously at the University of Oxford) said.

VKOLKATA: Bengal, a pioneer in developing grid-connected and off-grid solar power, has started losing its prime position. Of the total investment of Rs 16,000 crore in grid-connected solar power projects in the country, West Bengal is lagging far behind with only two projects totalling Rs 70 crore. in grid connected solar energy projects.Under the remote village electrification programme of the ministry of new and renewable energy, only 6 villages have been electrified in Bengal in last 3 years. The dismal state of affairs for the growth of solar energy in the state becomes stark when compared to Assam (1,017 villages), Orissa (726 villages), Tripura (441 villages) and Madhya Pradesh (327).According to the 2011 census, in the off grid power sector, about 2.40 lakh households in rural Bengal used solar energy. That was the highest in the country followed by Uttar Pradesh where 1.60 lakh rural households used solar power. But, in last two to three years, the growth percentage in Bengal has dipped.The recent data, submitted a month back by the Centre ministry of new and renewable energy,on financial assistance for solar projects provided to West Bengal, reveals that allocation for Bengal gradually came down during 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13, from Rs 11.78 crore to Rs 12.47 crore, Rs 8.12 crore and Rs 3.82 crore respectively. The Centre provides such assistance to West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency for various off-grid solar photovoltaic systems and power projects.The first grid connected 2 MW solar power project was set up in Asansol with an investment of Rs 30 crore. This was the first such project in the country, followed by a 5MW project in Durgapur with an investment of Rs 40 crore. Ironically, no further plans came up after that. Lack of any concrete plan, the share of the state started to fall down while neighbouring states like Chattisgarh, Assam and Bihar went ahead following the Bengal model.Gujarat, Maharastra and Rajasthan now share 80% of the total 1600 MW of grid connected solar power used in the country now. These states also have the advantage of higher solar radiation compared to the eastern and north eastern states, including Bengal. The other states get more incentive by producing more solar power. Also other states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even Orrisa got into the scheme by coming up with new renewable energy proposals whereas there is nothing in the pipeline for West Bengal.Solar expert S P Gon Chaudhuri, who was formerly the advisor to the Bengal government's power department, said although the state came up with a renewable energy policy, it was but the policies werenot implemented properly. "The growth rate of using solar and renewable energy in the state could have been better," he added.

VNEW DELHI: Climate scientists are more certain that ever before that global warming is being caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. A leaked draft of the first of three reports comprising the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report states that it is \u201cat least 95% likely\u201d that human activities are the main cause of climate change since the 1950s.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established by the United Nations and World Meteorological Organisation , is tasked with providing scientific guidance to governments across the world in developing policies to counter climate change. The IPCC is not a research organisation. Under the aegis of IPCC, scientists, researchers, think tanks, and not for profit organisations assess and process the work in the field of science relating to climate change.Scientific certainty over the human contribution has become more robust over the last 25 years. In the last assessment report of the IPCC released in 2007, scientists were able to establish a 90% certainity, in 2001 it was 66% and in 1995 it was 50%. Calling into question the position taken by a minority of scientists that the global warming experience over the last half century was a natural climate phenomena.The draft report, seen by ET, due to be released at the end of September, finds that greenhouses gases like carbon dioxide have contributed to a global mean surface warming in the range of 0.5 degrees Celsius to 1.3 degrees Celsius between 1951 and 2010. Accounting for the cooling effects of aerosols (-0.6degree to 0.1 degree), and variations due to natural climate processes (-0.1 degree to 0.1 degree), the draft report finds a warming of 0.6 degrees over the period.Climate scientists say it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d that human influence on climate caused more than half of the increase in global average temperature. The concentrations of greenhouse gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have all increased since 1750. The concentration of carbon dioxide is up by 40% from the pre-industrial levels. The report states a 20% rise in the levels of carbon dioxide since 1958, when systematic atmospheric measurements began. The levels of methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere have exceeded pre-industrial levels by 150% and 20%, respectively.The draft report takes cognisance of the fact though global temperatures have been rising that the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998 to 2012) is smaller than the trend since 1951. The draft IPCC report states that the slowdown in the warming rate could be on account of natural variations in weather, and other factors like greater than expected quantities of volcanic ash , a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-year solar cycle, more heat being absorbed by oceans.But a slower warming rate provides no consolation, nor should it be a pretext to slowdown efforts to counter climate change. The World Metereological Organisation has reported that the decade from 2001-2010 was the warmest since the start of modern temperature measurements in 1850. The IPCC draft report states that the global mean temperature change between 2016 and 2035 will be in the range of 0.3 degrees to 0.7 degrees Celsius.The IPCC report stresses that long-lived greenhouses gases like carbon dioxide will determine the nature of global warming. The report warns that continued greenhouse gas emissions would cause further warming. Emissions at current levels or higher would lead to changes in all components of the climatic system. The draft report is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d than in most places, there will more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes and that it is \u201cvery likely\u201d that heat waves will occur with higher frequency and duration. The draft report states that scientists are highly confident that the warming will be larger over oceans and that Artic region will warm most rapidly.

VBut other market participants, including Thomas D. O\u2019Malley, chairman of PBF Energy in Parsippany, N.J., identified JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions as being active sellers of the credits this year. He said the institutions had helped transform an environmental program into a profit machine, contributing to the market frenzy this year. \u201cThese things were designed to monitor the inclusion of ethanol in the gasoline pool,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t designed to become a speculative item. For the life of me I can\u2019t see the justification for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile banks are by no means the largest player in ethanol credits, Wall Street\u2019s activity in this market reflects a larger effort by financial institutions to exert their influence over loosely regulated markets for basic commodities, from aluminum to oil. The opacity of the ethanol credit market makes it difficult to determine the extent to which large financial actors have profited.\u000a\u000aThe banks say they have far less influence in the market than others are suggesting, and are doing nothing wrong. But the activities, while legal, could have consequences for consumers. In the end, energy analysts say, the outcome will be felt at the gas pump \u2014 as the higher cost of the ethanol credits gets tacked onto the price of a gallon of gasoline. (The credits, which cost 7 cents each in January, peaked at $1.43 in July, and now are trading for 60 cents.)\u000a\u000aThe Valero Energy Corporation , a refiner that owns thousands of gas stations, says the squeeze in ethanol credits might cost it $800 million. PBF Energy, also a refiner, puts its bill at about $200 million. A review by The Times of a federal registry of nearly 1,500 businesses and individuals in the renewable fuel market found big Wall Street banks as well as a handful of people with troubled legal histories among the participants. Several high-profile cases of fraud have emerged.\u000a\u000aScott Mixon, the acting chief economist of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , said in an interview Friday that the issue of banks\u2019 involvement in this market was something the agency was tracking and might look into more deeply because of the ethanol component. The commission regulates the commodities futures market, including trading in ethanol and gasoline.\u000a\u000aThough the ethanol credits are traded by many major investment houses, they were created not on Wall Street but in Washington, on Capitol Hill and at the Environmental Protection Agency . At its inception, the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard was promoted as a means to reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on foreign oil, fight global warming and provide a boost to farmers. The rules call for a set amount of ethanol, most of which is made from corn, and other renewable fuels to be blended with fossil fuels each year, with quotas assigned to individual refiners and importers.\u000a\u000aEvery time they mix ethanol into gas, or import fuel already blended with ethanol, energy companies get a credit from the government, and that credit can be sold to other companies that don\u2019t blend ethanol to help them meet federal requirements. If refiners fall short of their obligation, they can face fines of $32,500 a day. To monitor compliance, each gallon of ethanol is assigned a 38-digit Renewable Identification Number, or RIN. Six billion of them were generated in the first six months of this year.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aThe E.P.A. makes sure participants comply with the fuel standard. But rules that apply to almost every other market \u2014 on transparency, disclosure and position limits, for example \u2014 are not imposed on the trade of RINs, making Wall Street\u2019s role harder to gauge.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aIf Wall Street traders take a 5 percent stake in a public company\u2019s stock, for instance, they are required by law to flag that they have acquired a sizable stake in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . There is no such obligation for traders buying RINs.\u000a\u000aLike JPMorgan, other big banks downplay their involvement, contending that they are in the market primarily because their firms, through subsidiaries and other arrangements, have ownership interests in gasoline and other energy production and therefore are required to participate in the federal renewable fuels program.\u000a\u000aUntil 1999, regulations barred banks from owning nonfinancial companies like commodities operations. This was meant to keep banks from self-dealing or pursuing monopolistic practices in their financial operations that could benefit their nonfinancial affiliates. Separating these operations, regulators believed, would also protect a bank\u2019s core lending and deposit-taking businesses from risky trading by nonfinancial units. Those restrictions fell by the wayside with the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which struck down Depression-era banking laws. Now, however, the Federal Reserve is reviewing commodities ownership by banks.\u000a\u000aIn the case of JPMorgan, the industry executives familiar with its activities in the RINs market said they were told by a top banker in its commodities operation about the stockpiling. The executives said the banker maintained that one of JPMorgan\u2019s traders had urged the bank to buy up every available credit. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harming business relationships.\u000a\u000aThrough a spokesman, the banker denied that the conversation took place. Mr. Marchiony, the JPMorgan spokesman, characterized the report as a misunderstanding. He denied the bank had stockpiled the credits. He added that the bank mainly dealt in RINs as a byproduct of its joint venture with a refiner in Philadelphia . \u201cThe fact of the matter is, we simply don\u2019t trade RINs, nor do we carry an inventory other than a marginal amount for compliance purposes,\u201d the statement said.\u000a\u000aMorgan Stanley also generates RINs through TransMontaigne, a subsidiary with 21 blending facilities, and it trades the credits via the Morgan Stanley Capital Group. According to regulatory filings, TransMontaigne\u2019s biggest customer for its energy products is the commodities unit of the Morgan Stanley Capital Group, a trading operation that runs out of the former Texaco headquarters in Purchase, N.Y.\u000a\u000aMark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said that the firm had not benefited from the increase in RIN prices in 2013. \u201cThe firm\u2019s obligation to purchase RINs as part of our importing and blending of gasoline exceeded the RINs we have received from our wholesale business,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMr. Lake declined to discuss Morgan Stanley\u2019s holdings of RINs or to say whether the bank\u2019s traders used market information received from TransMontaigne.\u000a\u000aTrading on information gleaned from a subsidiary like TransMontaigne would be illegal in the stock market, but there are no rules against it in commodities. ( Morgan Stanley also holds a stake Heidmar Holdings, of Norwalk, Conn., which owns a fleet of oil tankers.)\u000a\u000aSaule T. Omarova, an associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , said Morgan Stanley\u2019s overlapping activities illustrate how large financial institutions have become deeply entwined in every aspect of the commodities markets.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the trading chain between the oil well and the gas station,\u201d Ms. Omarova said, \u201cMorgan Stanley is clearly accumulating as many stakes along the way as possible because that is what gives them the most flexibility of control.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeizing an Opportunity\u000a\u000aThe market in ethanol credits is exactly the kind Wall Street loves: opaque, lightly regulated and potentially very lucrative.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aOfficials at the E.P.A., which oversees the market, say they have seen no evidence of improper trading, like hoarding, in the market. But they do not police the RIN market as a financial regulator would.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf there were any evidence now or in the future that that was happening, we have the ability to amend the regulation to constrain that,\u201d said Christopher Grundler, director of E.P.A.\u2019s office of transportation and air quality, which oversees the renewable fuels program.\u000a\u000aIt is difficult for outside groups, or even other regulators and law enforcement agencies, to keep tabs on the market, because the E.P.A. declines to disclose who actively trades the credits, or how much they trade, citing the confidentiality of refiners and other participants.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aTrading is a private affair, usually conducted by phone, and just about anyone can participate. In creating the market, the E.P.A. says it did not limit the market for RINs to refiners and other energy companies because it wanted to encourage a free market.\u000a\u000aPrice movements on other commodities futures are limited by the exchanges on which they trade as a check on speculation. But the biofuel credits are not traded on an exchange: their prices are unbridled. And, unlike in the broader financial industry, no formal qualification or license is required before a broker can start trading.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a RINs trading desk at any major brokerage now,\u201d said Paul Niznik, bio-fuels manager for Hart Energy, based in Houston . \u201cThere are people who are not refiners that are buying and selling RINs like a commodity. They treat it like something to be traded, to be day-traded.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe RINs story began in 2005, when the Bush administration joined Democrats in Congress to pass an energy bill mandating renewable fuel standards. That law was broadened in 2007 to establish requirements for the amount of biofuel to be blended into gasoline annually through 2022. This year, refiners and importers are required to blend 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol, up from 13.2 billion last year. For 2014, the figure is 14.4 billion.\u000a\u000aBut the estimates Congress used about how much gas Americans would keep buying were wrong. When the biofuel credits were created, gasoline consumption was projected to grow 6 percent by 2013. But thanks in large part to the recession and more fuel-efficient cars, consumption has actually fallen.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\u000a\u000aAs a result, refiners this year began hitting what is known as \u201cthe blend wall,\u201d meaning that the amount of ethanol the government is requiring them to use is close to the maximum amount that can be blended into gasoline without creating problems for gas stations and motorists.\u000a\u000aDistributing gasoline with greater levels of ethanol is more costly and corrodes gas station pumps and tanks. Raising the ethanol level in gasoline, therefore, would require gas stations across America to install new systems. Therefore, refiners have turned to RINs to meet their government obligations rather than blend more ethanol into gasoline.\u000a\u000aSome say financial players saw it coming, and jumped into the market.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you see something change as rapidly as this, somebody\u2019s hoarding them, somebody\u2019s buying them, somebody\u2019s making big bucks,\u201d said Senator Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma , a big oil state. After his staff examined the run-up in prices this summer, he said he was concerned that \u201cbig moneyed interests\u201d were gaming the credits.\u000a\u000aFor now, companies like Valero say that they are eating the cost of high RIN prices, which are still eight times more expensive than they were in January. But industry analysts, executives and even researchers at the investment banks predict the cost of the RINs\u2019 surge will be passed along to consumers by increasing the price of gasoline, if not later this year then next year.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMr. O\u2019Malley, the chairman of PBF Energy, likens the outcome to a hidden tax on the public. Unlike other taxes, which go to the government, this one goes to the speculators.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aDouble-Dipping on Credits\u000a\u000aEvery day, RINs are born in places like Fort Lauderdale , Fla., Chesapeake, Va., and Bainbridge, Ga. Across a network of 45 fuel terminals in the Southeast, and along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, Morgan Stanley\u2019s TransMontaigne stores, blends and distributes gasoline and other fuels.\u000a\u000aEven though it is based in Denver , TransMontaigne sits at the center of a powerful Wall Street energy operation. It delivers 200,000 barrels of refined petroleum products each day, just under 2.5 percent of the total market, and plays a role in the RINs market in addition to any trading its parent, Morgan Stanley, might do. Morgan Stanley bought TransMontaigne in 2006.\u000a\u000aFor banks, trading RINs for clients can be lucrative. A big reason is that the credits are far more difficult to buy and sell because they are not traded on exchanges like stocks. As a result, the difference between the price at which one party is willing to sell and another is willing to buy is unusually wide. Those fat spreads mean big money for anyone serving as a middleman.\u000a\u000aAt a hearing in late July at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mr. Mixon, the commission\u2019s acting chief economist, estimated that RIN spreads were 4 percent of a transaction\u2019s value. That is far more than the average stock commission.\u000a\u000aIn addition to Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, other big banks, like Citigroup and Barclays , are also registered with the E.P.A. to trade the credits.\u000a\u000aEdward Westlake, an analyst at Credit Suisse , said many big financial firms have gone beyond RINs trading and pushed into blending fuel to create them as well. \u201cBuilding a tank and blending doesn\u2019t cost a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Westlake said, \u201cand there are folks on Wall Street who own tanks who are benefiting from the RINs.\u201d\u000a\u000aBank research departments are also trying to pique investor interest in this market. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently published bullish reports on the market. In July, Morgan Stanley published a report predicting that RIN prices would keep rising \u2014 and eventually cause gas prices to spike later this year.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aOfficials at the E.P.A. do not see excessive influence by financial speculators. They suggest the price spikes in RINs this year reflect the expectation of a shortage of the credits because rising renewable fuel mandates are occurring as consumer demand for gasoline is falling. \u201cThe market is expecting this future scarcity as the statutory mandates continue to increase,\u201d Mr. Grundler said.\u000a\u000aOthers say that prices are up mostly because the oil industry has refused to invest in renewable energy. For example, Jeremy Martin, a clean energy expert for the Union of Concerned Scientists , said many of the complaints about the credits come from industry players who want to see the renewable fuels program killed.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was meant to change behavior, and it was understood that if it was to be binding, RIN prices would not be close to zero,\u201d Mr. Martin said.\u000a\u000aIn fact even before RINs took off, they had become a contentious issue within the energy industry. Ethanol producers like the renewable fuel standards because they essentially guarantee a market for their product. But refiners \u2014 particularly those without operations to blend the fuel \u2014 regard the standards as an onerous and unnecessary business cost.\u000a\u000aThe Impact at the Pump\u000a\u000aMargo T. Oge, who oversaw the creation of the ethanol credit program at the E.P.A., says that the rising price of RINs \u2014 no matter the cause \u2014 is good news and an indication that the program\u2019s goals are being met.\u000a\u000aAs the credits get more expensive, she says, oil and gas companies have a financial incentive to add more ethanol to fuel rather than buy credits. That, in turn, reduces oil imports and emissions \u2014 which was the point of creating the system in the first place.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aMs. Oge, who retired from the E.P.A. last year and is now a visiting scholar at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research group in Washington, said RINs were never supposed to affect the price of gasoline at the pump. If that is the result of the price run-up this year, as many energy analysts predict, it would be an unwelcome outcome, she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe last thing we wanted in implementing this program is to get price increases for the consumer,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aEven beyond the likely rise in gasoline prices, critics of the RINs market say it is deeply flawed, and they do not share Ms. Oge\u2019s optimistic takeaway of this year\u2019s market frenzy.\u000a\u000aFirst, by allowing anyone to trade, including those with no real interest in energy, the E.P.A. encouraged speculation, the critics say. Second, the market operates largely in the dark, leaving it vulnerable to manipulation. Third, and perhaps most significant, the federal requirement for ethanol in gasoline means oil companies are captive buyers \u2014 meaning they are required to buy the credits when they do not or cannot blend their own fuel \u2014 a fact that savvy traders use to their advantage.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe problem the E.P.A. had is they opened up the market on the trading side, but restricted it on the obligated side to refiners and importers,\u201d said Lawrence J. Goldstein, the former president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit bipartisan group.\u000a\u000aAnalysts and others say the market is vulnerable to questionable practices like short squeezes, where prices are pushed up by holders of the credits to benefit their positions.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnybody who\u2019s participating in these markets has the opportunity to throw their weight around,\u201d said David J. Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a transportation energy consulting firm. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a hedge fund or a refiner or ethanol producer, they would tend to drive the market in directions that are beneficial for whatever their goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn examination by The Times of participants registered with the E.P.A. found several people with troubled pasts, including one who was accused of helping run a Ponzi scheme , and another who pleaded guilty to illegal storage of hazardous waste.\u000a\u000aThe RINs market has come off the boil recently, but at 60 cents apiece the credits still cost far more than they did at the beginning of the year. While the E.P.A. says the market is sound, W. David Montgomery, an economist at Nera Economic Consulting, a unit of Marsh & McLennan , said the agency should install an overseer.\u000a\u000aThe E.P.A. disagrees, but said it was considering providing more data on who trades and holds RINs and had instituted a voluntary certification system for participants.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are exploring things like increasing the regularity of updating the transactional data system and providing more information about production volumes,\u201d Mr. Grundler, the E.P.A. official, said. \u201cAll are aimed at increasing confidence in this market and increasing compliance, which is our major concern.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Tom Kloza, an analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, a leading source of petroleum pricing, said the potential for abuse will not disappear on its own.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou could conceivably have a company in the middle holding millions of RINs,\u201d Mr. Kloza said. \u201cAny entity could have a 1, 2 or 5 percent market share in RINs and is waiting to sell them at some explosive gain. I wonder, who\u2019s got the score card?\u201d

VK P Prabhakaran Nair By\u000a\u000aMore than three decades ago, in a very important international scientific conference on global soil management in Hamburg, Germany, to which I was invited as a key speaker in the opening session, I referred to soil as \u201csoul of infinite life\u201d, which elicited an amused laughter from the audience. During the coffee recess, those amused surrounded me to ask why I referred to soil as \u201csoul\u201d, while the common refrain then, as of now, is that it is an inert and lifeless matter.\u000a\u000aI wish not to dilate on the scientific hypothesis here to substantiate my statement, suffice to say, that contrary to what many think, soil has a soul, not in the sense that human body has, but, if one explores the depth of what a soil does in its minutest fraction, that is clay (less than 2 Angstrom in width, an Angstrom is one-thousandth of a millimetre) one will appreciate what I said. Let me explain a common phenomenon. We all know how important water is to life. Yet, how many of us stop to think that without soil there simply will be no water for sustenance of life on this planet? My explanation about soil becomes increasingly relevant in the context of global warming, about which there is currently much talk, because of the UN supported Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change report, which will be out by September-end.\u000a\u000aIn India policy makers spend colossal sums of money on water \u201cconservation\u201d, water \u201cmanagement\u201d and so on. Yet, rarely do I come across projects which talk of \u201csoil And water\u201d management in one frame. Either it is soil or it is water. Without soil there simply is no water. Look at this basic electro-chemical reaction. Of all the soil particles, the clay is the most dynamic and, in my opinion, the most lively (almost akin to a soul). It has excess negative electrical charge at its surface. A water molecule (H2O) has a hydrogen (positively charged atom) bonded to oxygen (a negatively charged atom), and when rainwater falls from the sky after condensation from water vapour, this hydrogen atom is electrically attracted to the clay surface, which has a negative charge, which in turn is bonded to an oxygen atom, with negative charge, and thus a chain of water molecules is built around the clay particle. If there was no soil all the water will simply seep into the sea. And, to be sure, water simply cannot exist in outer space, except in the vapour form.\u000a\u000aThe crucial question is, what has all this to do with climate change? Let me explain. Why is it that in the Arabian desert, after nightfall, whether it is summer or winter, the atmosphere cools? And in the Terai region, at the foothills of the Himalayas, in UP, with very fertile and productive dark clay soil, it is warm even after nightfall? The answer is, in the Arabian desert, the white sand reflects all the heat absorbed during day, while in Terai, the black clayey soil absorbs all the heat and simply cannot reflect it at night.\u000a\u000aLet me now link it with the global climate change, and how, one can bring about mitigation through intelligent soil management. The common refrain among environmentalists is that all that happens above the earth\u2019s surface (or what many mistakenly confuse with the so-called environment) only is important. Not many understand the crucial role soil plays in climate change. The centrality of soil is, more often than not, overlooked. This has been the bane of the chemically-powered Indian agriculture, euphemistically called the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d. Global climate, the past decade and a half, has not been warming up at rates earlier predicted. In fact, the rate of warming over the past decade and a half from 1998-2012 at 0.05 degree Celsius per decade, is comparably less than that during the six decades between 1951-2012 \u20140.12 degree Celsius per decade. In absolute terms, between 1951 and 2012, that is six decades, the increase was 140 per cent, that is nearly 24 per cent per decade, which is a substantial increase given the global scale. This simply shows that the rate of increase of late is much lower than what pessimists try to make out. This in no way is room for solace. We have many other contributory factors that are quite worrying.\u000a\u000aOf all human activities, high-input chemical agriculture contributes substantially to global warming, which many are unaware of. Most environmentalists pin down carbon dioxide as the biggest culprit in global warming. But we have one factor, N2O (nitrous oxide), a by-product of chemical changes from nitrogenous fertiliser application in soil, a far bigger culprit than carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming. N2O naturally occurs in atmosphere as part of the earth\u2019s cycle, and has a variety of natural sources, chemically-driven agriculture being the main one. N2O molecules stay in the atmosphere for an average of 120 years before being removed or destroyed through chemical reactions. A pound of N2O causes over 300 times more to global warming than a pound of carbon dioxide, emanating from industrial activities or automobile emission. In a highly industrialised US agriculture, N2O emissions from soils have increased 80 per cent between 1990 and 2011, accounting for about 5 per cent of all greenhouse gases combined contributing to global warming. Agricultural soil management is the largest source of N2O emissions in US, accounting for 69 per cent of total emissions in 2011.\u000a\u000aWhat important lesson should India take against the backdrop of the above phenomenon, totally underplayed by the so-called environmentalists?\u000a\u000aIndia must completely reorient its soil management techniques to make its agriculture sustainable in the long run and, also, in the process, dramatically lessen India\u2019s contribution of its own share of global warming, which will first affect us and then only others. Go to Punjab, the \u201ccradle\u201d of the chemically-powered green revolution to understand what I say here. The soils are degraded, the aquifers dried, groundwater polluted rendering it non-potable because of excessive nitrate loading (emanating from unbridled urea use) and biodiversity vanished due to continuous rice-wheat monoculture. No balance sheet of N2O has been made here. And none knows how much of warming has been contributed by this mindless farming, which while producing extra food, ruined India\u2019s soils and environment. A revolutionary soil management technique, developed by the author, during more than three decades of research in Europe, Africa and Asia, now globally known as The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept, might hold some important answers.\u000a\u000aThe author is an international agricultural scientist and can be reached at drkppnair@gmail.com

VThe report issued on September 27 by the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) may sound similar to the one issued five years ago \u2013 after all, it says that humanity is causing climate change, though with more certainty. But on two key aspects this report has categorically said what was never said before.The first is that the carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and resulting global warming have blown away the 2 degree Celsius tipping point that was earlier set. The present report says that to limit warming to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, 1,000 gigatons (trillion metric tons) is the outer limit of carbon dioxide that can be emitted. However, by 2011 humans had already emitted 531 gigatons. That leaves very little wiggle room. According to climate change experts, the 1,000-gigaton limit may well be crossed in the next 25 years.The world has a total of 2,795 gigatons worth of carbon in the form of fossil fuels and reserves. Burning just 10% of these would take the earth over the tipping point. That\u2019s the stark message coming from the IPCC report.The report makes the second categorical assertion regarding sea level rise. It says that sea levels are projected to rise by 28-97 centimetres by 2100. This is over 50% more than the previous projection of 18-59% over the same period. This increase is mainly because of better estimation methods and more observations. By the year 2300, it is projected that seas will be higher by up to a cataclysmic 3 meters.Buried in the dense Summary for Policymakers, the report issued this week, is a series of future global scenarios. If you look at India, in the worst case scenario, temperatures will rise by up to 4 degrees Celsius and rainfall will increase by up to 20% over most of the sub-continent. Coupled with sea level along India\u2019s long coastline \u2013 on which are located megapolises like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata \u2013 this spells a dire picture by the turn of this century. Of course, this is the worst case scenario, in which carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled from the present in the next 80-odd years.How scientific and robust is the IPCC\u2019s statements and predictions? The whole process involved 9,200 scientific studies, reviewed by 1089 experts from 55 countries working in a multistage process. They received 54, 677 comments from scientists across the world. Over 2 million gigabytes of numerical data was analyzed before 209 authors put together the draft report. Then representatives of 195 countries went over it word by word.Most scientists agree that the IPCC\u2019s reports are on the conservative side because they are forced to accommodate everybody, including governments that are wary of sounding too alarmist. In the present report, for instance, two observed facts leading to increasing carbon dioxide release are not fully taken aboard \u2013 the melting of permafrost and ocean acidification. Scientists have observed that both these on-going processes will cause an even greater amount of carbon dioxide to be released (or remain unabsorbed) than before. But these are not fully spelt out yet. Similarly warming of the deep sea (beyond 700 feet) is also not fully described or accounted for as the IPCC stopped collecting evidence 6 months ago, in order to start the consultation process.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aBy >Ed Hawkins , University of Reading\u000a\u000aClimate change is often seen as a recent phenomenon, but its roots are actually far older \u2013 the effects of human activity on the global climate have been discussed for more than 150 years.\u000a\u000aIn the 1820s, the French mathematician >Joseph Fourier was trying to understand the various factors that affect Earth\u2019s temperature. But he found a problem \u2013 according to his calculations, the Earth should have been a ball of ice.\u000a\u000aThe most obvious factor, the Sun, did not seem to provide enough energy to raise the temperature of Earth above freezing. Fourier\u2019s initial ideas, that there must be additional energy coming from the Earth\u2019s core or from the temperature of outer space, were soon dismissed. Fourier then realised that the atmosphere, which at first seemed transparent, could be playing a crucial role.\u000a\u000aThen, in 1861, the Irish physicist >John Tyndall performed an experiment which changed our view of the atmosphere. Tyndall demonstrated that gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorbed infrared radiation, and could trap heat within the atmosphere. He immediately realised the implications and >remarked that these gases \u201cwould produce great effects on the terrestrial rays and produce corresponding changes of climate.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough this discovery would have profound consequences for understanding future climate, Tyndall, like most of his colleagues, was primarily interested in understanding the causes of ice ages, which had been discovered in 1837 by >Louis Agassiz.\u000a\u000aWhat was missing however was an estimate of how much these gases could warm or cool the planet. >Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, provided the first numerical estimates of \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d \u2013 defined as the temperature change corresponding to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He suggested a value around 4C in 1896.\u000a\u000aWhile the scientists continued to debate the causes of the ice ages, the Earth was warming. From the 1920s onwards meteorologists began to realise that the climate of various regions had changed. >Joseph Kincer suggested in 1933 that temperatures in individual cities had been rising. At the same time, others had started measuring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But, it took an amateur meteorologist to put the puzzle together.\u000a\u000a>Guy Stewart Callendar was a steam engineer who was fascinated by the weather. He meticulously collected temperature records from around the world, examined the carbon dioxide measurements and studied the work of Arrhenius and others. In his spare time, and without the aid of a computer, he performed the tedious calculations required to measure the temperature of the planet. These efforts produced the first evidence that Earth\u2019s surface was warming.\u000a\u000aExactly 75 years ago, in 1938, Callendar delivered >his analysis to the Fellows of the >Royal Meteorological Society. He revealed evidence for a 0.3C rise in global temperatures over the previous 50 years and suggested that this was largely due to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning. His findings were found to be interesting, but were not viewed as conclusive by the esteemed Fellows.\u000a\u000aUndeterred, Callendar continued his research, gathering additional evidence. In later years he published the first estimates of the change in carbon dioxide over time, prompting >Charles Keeling to set up the first dedicated observatory for measuring gases in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIn 1961, Callendar updated his estimates for global temperatures with more observations, and these agree >remarkably well with our current understanding. Callendar also felt that a warmer climate would be beneficial as it would \u201cdelay the return of the deadly glaciers\u201d and allow crops to be grown at higher latitudes.\u000a\u000aIn the 75 years since Callendar\u2019s discovery that carbon dioxide was warming the planet, much more has been learnt about the climate. But the basic picture has not changed. We are now more confident than ever of the role of human activity on global temperatures. We also have a more complete understanding of the consequences of a warmer planet.\u000a\u000aWith all the attention on the >IPCC\u2019s 5th Assessment Report in 2013, the considerable efforts of Callendar and his contemporaries in advancing our understanding of the climate should not be forgotten.\u000a\u000aEd Hawkins receives funding from the UK Natural Environment Research Council. He is affiliated with the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis article was originally published at >The Conversation. Read the >original article.

VS. Satapathy, Director\u2013Climate Change, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, urged CII to lead the industry action on climate change initiatives and partner with various State governments respectively.\u000a\u000aHe emphasised the importance of forging linkages between private-public partnership model and climate change initiatives, at a climate change conclave organised by the CII.\u000a\u000aSharing the Government perspective, he said, \u201cAs a response to climate change, India has taken a voluntary pledge during the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009 to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent by 2020 in comparison with 2005 level excluding agriculture sector.\u201d\u000a\u000aA.

VT he latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has put out a blunt message: the world is perhaps three decades away from catastrophe. The panel says the world should not emit more than 1,445 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide if it has to have a good chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees celsius. The current emission rate is around 50 billion tonnes a year. Work out the numbers.\u000a\u000aClimate change sceptics may argue that the panel is being unnecessarily glum. But, even if we consider massive climate change to be an outlier, it is prudent to start thinking hard about it. The world increasingly appreciates the potency of black swans\u2014low probability events that have a very high impact. Climate change is one.\u000a\u000aThere is a view that the frontlines of change will involve individuals, firms and cities. But it is hard to see how a global public good such as temperature stability can be ensured without agreements between governments.

VA man from one of the lowest-lying nations on Earth is trying to convince New Zealand judges that he\u2019s a refugee suffering not from persecution, but from climate change.\u000a\u000aThe man (37) and his wife left his remote atoll in the Pacific nation of Kiribati six years ago for higher ground and better prospects in New Zealand, where their three children were born. Immigration authorities have twice rejected his argument that rising sea levels make it too dangerous for him and his family to return to Kiribati.\u000a\u000aSo on October 16, the man\u2019s lawyer, Michael Kidd, plans to argue the case before New Zealand\u2019s High Court. Mr. Kidd, who specialises in human rights cases, told The Associated Press he will appeal the case all the way to the country\u2019s Supreme Court if necessary.\u000a\u000aLegal experts consider the man\u2019s case a long shot, but it will nevertheless be closely watched, and might have implications for tens of millions of residents in low-lying islands around the world. Kiribati, an impoverished string of 33 coral atolls about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, has about 103,000 people and has been identified by scientists as among the nations most vulnerable to climate change.\u000a\u000aIn a transcript of the immigration case obtained by the AP, the Kiribati man describes extreme high tides \u2014 known as king tides \u2014 that he says have started to regularly breach Kiribati\u2019s defences killing crops, flooding homes and sickening residents. New Zealand immigration laws prevent the AP from naming him.\u000a\u000aThe man said that around 1998, king tides began regularly breaching the sea walls around his village, which was overcrowded and had no sewerage system. He said the fouled drinking water would make people vomit, and that there was no higher ground that would allow villagers to escape the knee-deep water.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no future for us when we go back to Kiribati,\u201d he told the tribunal, according to the transcript. \u201cEspecially for my children. There\u2019s nothing for us there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe man\u2019s lawyer said the family is currently living and working on a New Zealand farm.\u000a\u000aLast week, an international panel of climate scientists issued a report saying that it was \u201cextremely likely\u201d that human activity was causing global warming, and predicted that oceans could rise by as much as one meter by the end of the century. If that were to happen, much of Kiribati would simply disappear.\u000a\u000aThough that is a dire prospect, New Zealand\u2019s Immigration and Protection Tribunal has said it is not one that is addressed by laws dealing with refugees.\u000a\u000aIn a decision recently made public, tribunal member Bruce Burson said the legal concept of a refugee is someone who is being persecuted, which requires human interaction. He said the tribunal rejected the man\u2019s claim because nobody is persecuting him.\u000a\u000aMr. Kidd argued that his client did suffer an indirect form of human persecution because climate change is believed to be caused by the pollution humans generate.Tidal gauges indicate the world\u2019s oceans have been rising at an annual rate of 3.2 mm since 1970. Many scientists expect that rate to accelerate and for climate change to trigger more intense storms, which may pose an even more pressing threat to many of the world\u2019s low-lying islands.\u000a\u000aKiribati\u2019s government is pursuing its own strategies. It has paid a deposit for 6,000 acres in nearby Fiji, which Kiribati President Anote Tong has said will provide food security and a possible refuge for future generations. The nation has also been talking with a Japanese firm about the possibility of constructing a floating island, which would cost billions of dollars.\u000a\u000a\u2014 AP

VNEW DELHI: North India is likely to heat up more than the southern parts of the country while the entire Indian subcontinent may see longer rainy seasons in second half of the century, the UN\u2019s climate body has predicted in its latest comprehensive document on climate change.The conclusion, showing variation in temperature and rainfall in South Asia , is part of the lengthy technical details of the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which made its comprehensive report \u2014 Climate Change 2013, The Physical Science Basis \u2014 public in Stockholm on Monday.The findings of the report show that the northern part of the continent is likely to witness winter temperatures rise of up to 0.4 to 0.8 degree Celsius during 2016-35 as compared to the 1986-2005 average, 2 to 3 degree Celsius during 2046-65 and up to 3 to 5 degree Celsius by the end of the century (2081-2100), under different scenarios of action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.Though the UN body\u2019s report on region-wise \u201cimpact, adaptation and vulnerability\u201d will come out in March next year, the technical details comprising 14 chapters and Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections in its annexure carry indications of these changes in South Asia.Krishna Kumar Kanikicharla, climate scientist at Pune\u2019s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and one of the drafting authors of the IPCC report, told TOI there was \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d of the impact of the climate change on monsoons in South Asia and the tropical cyclone system in the Bay of Bengal Kanikicharla, responsible for drafting the chapter comprising details of monsoon systems, said: \u201cThere is strong hint that the duration of the rainy season would increase due to early onset of monsoon. The quantum of rainfall will also increase during the later part of this century.\u201dHe said though the Indian summer monsoon circulation will weaken, rainfall will increase due to higher atmospheric moisture resulting from a rise in temperatures.In its projection for South Asia, the technical summary of the report clearly points at \u201cenhanced summer monsoon precipitation and increased rainfall extremes of landfall cyclones on the coasts of the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea\u201d.What is the confidence level of these predictions? Prashant Goswami, one of the lead authors of the IPCC report, admitted that these conclusions were based on climatic projections that were not as firm as those made at a global level.\u201cThese uncertainties increase as you go to smaller scale (from global to regional or from regional to sub-regional levels). But one has to have an element of faith in these conclusions which are based on well defined scientific methodology,\u201d Goswami, chief scientist at Bangalore\u2019s CSIR Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation, told TOI.The impact of temperature rise and rainfall variations on the region\u2019s agriculture that\u2019s highly dependent on monsoon, will be considered in the report on impact, adaptation and vulnerability, to be released next year as part of the IPCC\u2019s fifth assessment report (AR5).As far as global temperature is concerned, the summary report said it was likely to rise by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Sea levels, it said, could rise by 26-82 centimetres by the end of the century.A S Unnikrishnan, chief scientist of the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, said policymakers would have to rely on the global sea level rise projections to draw up their strategies to deal with the emerging scenarios.

VThe joys of a bountiful southwest monsoon are increasingly changing to anxiety as the rains unseasonally drag on in many parts of India. \u201cThe normal rains should be from June 1 to mid-September. In fact it usually reduces by August 15, and is not too strong after that. But it is raining at this time, hard,\u201d my uncle, who grows paddy in our village Adve near the South Karnataka coast, told me on October 6.\u000a\u000aHeavy precipitation\u000a\u000aA delayed withdrawal is happening in many regions. The New Delhi Regional Meteorological Centre has said that Delhi is slated to have its longest monsoon in 50 years. Rains persist in many parts of eastern India. In Gujarat, not just were they late, \u201cmany stations reported extremely heavy rainfall (over 250 mm a day) consecutively for six days\u201d until end-September (IMD, \u201cPreliminary Report of Recent Heavy Rains in Gujarat and Rajasthan,\u201d October 2013), causing heavy flooding in parts of Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. The delayed withdrawal of the monsoon is becoming a pattern, at least in some parts. In southern Karnataka for instance, this year has been the fourth time in seven years. It raises three questions: why is it happening? How does it impact livelihoods? And what issues does it throw up in a warmer world?\u000a\u000aLas Ninas, the stronger than usual winds that bring ocean waters and heat from east to west along the Equatorial Pacific, have often been given as the cause of recent extended monsoons. But not this time. Neither El Nio nor La Nia conditions have been present since the spring of 2012 (WMO, El Nio/La Nia Update, October 7, 2013). The India Met Department report mentioned earlier gives primacy this year to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) for the Gujarat floods in particular and \u201cthe large-scale revival of the Indian summer monsoon\u201d in general. The MJO is a tropical disturbance that travels eastward around the tropics in a cycle of varying duration, significantly influencing patterns of rainfall and surface temperature in the tropics and subtropics.\u000a\u000aImpacting agriculture\u000a\u000aA late monsoon retreat damages standing crop, particularly paddy, which needs some days of clear sunshine to dry, change colour and fully ripen. If you cut it when it\u2019s still wet, it affects the yield and quality of both the grain and fodder. Leave the crop standing in late rains, and there\u2019s a heightened threat of insect attacks in the dampness. If the unseasonal, late rain is strong, as happened this year, it results in some of the grain falling off, hurting yields. This also happened when I visited my village in November 2007. Everyone I spoke to said it was a bad year \u2014 a 25-40 per cent loss of paddy seemed the most common refrain. In 2010, late rains extended well over a thousand kilometres along western India, from Rajasthan to Kerala. The Maharashtra Chief Minister admitted that more than half the crop grown on 1.3 million acres had been damaged, and suicides >occurred among grape farmers . And the last time was late October 2011. The paddy crop was damaged, every time.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the farmers. It can also affect agricultural workers, for whom the extent of loss depends upon the number of potential days of earning lost, or getting less work. In 2010, we were carrying out a study of climate change impacts in Gujarat; extended rains again had severely damaged the cotton crop. In a number of villages in Sabarkantha district, women told us, \u201cNo one calls us for work now as all the crop has been damaged.\u201d Since cotton picking happens in repeated cycles, these women lost 30-40 days of work over the cotton season, or thousands of rupees per head. One can imagine its effects of earning, nutrition and nurturing on women already on the margins. Agricultural workers are usually missing from narratives of those affected by a changing climate. As are sharecroppers (DP/GALU/IUF, Where Have All the Seasons Gone? May 2011).\u000a\u000aHint of climate change\u000a\u000aGiven the above, warnings in the latest IPCC report should make us pause. \u201cMonsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions,\u201d says the Summary for Policymakers (p.16). More specifically, the subsection on the Indian monsoon in the full draft report says, \u201cRegarding seasonality, model agreement is high on an earlier onset and later retreat (chapter 14, p.12).\u201d Increased moisture flux from ocean to land in a warmer world is the reason given for increased precipitation but the report is not forthcoming (to me) about whether that is also the reason why monsoon retreat will be delayed. However, given that reality in many impact areas is manifesting earlier or more intensely than climate models predict, it would not surprise me if some of these late rain events already have the fingerprints of climate change.\u000a\u000aThis raises three issues: one, the IPCC report implies that delayed rains will become a repeated pattern. Not every year, but over time, with greater regularity and intensity. And intensity is something we may be unable to anticipate, as the Met Department report mentioned earlier says repeatedly. Two, we need to find out \u2014 this is work for government bodies and mass organisations \u2014 what adaptation strategies by farmers to cope with delayed monsoon retreats are successful, so they can then be reproduced. Three, the parameters of compensation need to be refined to compensate lower levels of yield loss for farmers than at present, and \u2014 a demand made by labour unions \u2014 widened to include agricultural workers and sharecroppers, who already are and will continue to be the less visible victims of global warming.\u000a\u000a(Nagraj Adve works and writes on issues related to global warming.

VA Pacific islander is seeking recognition as the world's first climate change refugee in New Zealand as rising seas threaten his low-lying homeland, the man's lawyer said Thursday.\u000a\u000aIoane Teitiota, 37, launched an appeal this week against a decision by New Zealand immigration authorities to refuse him refugee status and deport him to Kiribati in the central Pacific, lawyer Michael Kitt said.\u000a\u000aKitt acknowledged Teitiota's New Zealand visa had expired but said he should not face deportation because of the difficulties he would encounter in Kiribati -- which consists of more than 30 coral atolls, most only a few metres (feet) above sea level.\u000a\u000aHe said rising seas had already swamped parts of Kiribati, destroying crops and contaminating water supplies.\u000a\u000a"Fresh water is a basic human right... the Kiribati government is unable, and perhaps unwilling, to guarantee these things because it's completely beyond their control," Kitt told Radio New Zealand.\u000a\u000aHe said Teitiota's case had the potential to set an international precedent, not only for Kiribati's 100,000 residents but for all populations threatened by man-made climate change.\u000a\u000aIf his appeal is successful Teitiota would become the world's first climate refugee, Kitt said.\u000a\u000aAs the environmental problem worsened a new class of refugee was emerging that was not properly covered by existing international protocols, he added.\u000a\u000a"It's a fluid situation, eventually the courts and legislatures are going to have to make a decision on how we deal with this."\u000a\u000aKiribati is among a number of island states -- including Tuvalu, Tokelau and the Maldives -- the UN Human Rights Commission is concerned could become "stateless" due to climate change.\u000a\u000aKiribati government's has raised the prospect of relocating the entire population or building man-made islands to rehouse them if predictions the sea will rise by one metre (3.25 feet) by the end of the century prove accurate.\u000a\u000aIt has also moved to buy 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres) of land in Fiji to act as a farm for Kiribati if salt-water pollution means the islands in the former British colony can no longer produce crops.\u000a\u000aKitt said deporting Teitiota was like forcing a gay person to return to a country where they faced persecution, or a domestic violence victim to go to a nation where women's rights were not protected.\u000a\u000aIn refusing Teitiota's application earlier this year, immigration authorities argued that the Kiribati man could not be considered a refugee because no one in his homeland was threatening his life if he returned.\u000a\u000aKitt countered by arguing that the environment in Kiribati effectively poses a threat to Teitiota and the three children he fathered in New Zealand, who will have to return with him if he is deported.\u000a\u000a"Mr Teitiota is being persecuted passively by the circumstances in which he's living, which the Kiribati government has no ability to ameliorate," he said.\u000a\u000aKiribati joined a number of other Pacific states last month in signing the "Majuro declaration" on climate change, which calls for urgent action on an issue where small countries are bearing the brunt of impacts caused by major polluters.\u000a\u000aA judge in the Auckland high court reserved a decision on Teitiota's appeal on Wednesday and the judgement is expected to be released by the end of the month.

VClimate change is hitting closer to home than earlier expected. Agriculture production has seen a significant drop due to the effects of climate change such as increased temperature, floods and drought.\u000a\u000aIn a country struggling with rising population and the need to feed people ore every year, farm production is taking a big hit, according to Sanjoy Bandyopadhyay, Principal Scientist, Indian Agricultural Research Institute.\u000a\u000aHe was addressing a meet here on Friday on the \u2018Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture\u2019 organised by The Energy Research Institute (TERI).\u000a\u000aHe said that the production of wheat has dropped by six per cent, while rice and mustard production have narrowed by four per cent each.\u000a\u000aClimate change has resulted in 70 per cent of India\u2019s land becoming drought-prone, 12 per cent flood-prone, while eight per cent is affected by cyclones.\u000a\u000aAccording to a study conducted by World Bank earlier this year, since almost 60 per cent of India\u2019s crop area is rain-fed, change in precipitation would impact food production.\u000a\u000aThe study predicted that by 2050, a temperature increase of 2-2.5 degree Celsius is likely (compared to pre-industrialisation period), which would reduce the water availability for food production and 63 million people in India may not be able to meet their daily calorific requirement.

VNearly a third of the world's economic output, some $44 trillion (32 trillion euros), will by 2025 be in countries at the highest risk of climate change effects, said research published Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThis would represent a 50% increase over today in the share of global GDP (gross domestic product) in high or extreme risk countries, said the assessment by British risk consultancy Maplecroft.\u000a\u000aMost of these countries are ill prepared to deal with more severe floods, storms, droughts and sea-level rise likely to result from a warming planet, and the report said much investment is required in flood and other defences to protect infrastructure and assets.\u000a\u000a"Adaptive measures... will, however, require the sustained commitment of governments," said a statement from Maplecroft.\u000a\u000aThe 67 countries at highest risk include economic giants India in 20th place and China at number 61.\u000a\u000aTopping the list was Bangladesh, followed by Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Haiti, South Sudan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambodia, Philippines, Ethiopia, the Central African Republic, Eritrea and Chad.\u000a\u000aThe United States and much of Europe are in the "low" risk category -- partly because they had more money to spend on adaptation measures.\u000a\u000a"Many of the global growth markets are located in countries that are acutely vulnerable to climate change," said the report that measured risk of exposure in 193 countries along with their capacity to adapt.\u000a\u000a"The increased spending power of middle-class populations in growth economies is resulting in significant international investment in highly vulnerable regions."\u000a\u000aThe analysis found that five cities facing a "extreme" climate risk: Dhaka in Bangladesh, Mumbai and Kolkota in India, Manila in the Philippines and Bangkok in Thailand, expected to see their GDP triple from $275 billion to $804 billion by 2025.\u000a\u000a"The growing economic importance of cities in developing countries may increase exposure of assets, investments and supply chains to the impacts of climate change," said the report.\u000a\u000a"Cities with some of the biggest economic growth potential are among those with the greatest vulnerability to climate change."\u000a\u000aLondon and Paris are the only cities classified as "low" risk in an analysis of 50 cities.\u000a\u000aThe UN has set a target of limiting global warming to 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 deg Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels in order to avoid its worst effects.\u000a\u000aThis goal is mainly being targeted by projects to reduce emissions of Earth-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) created through fossil-fuel burning for energy production and transport.\u000a\u000aThe Maplecroft report said it appeared "increasingly unlikely", as greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, that the two-degree target could be met -- with potentially devastating effects like species extinctions, water shortages, crop die-offs, loss of land to the rising seas and disease spread.\u000a\u000aCurrently, there are more than 4.5 billion people, about 64 % of the global population, living in countries at high or extreme climate change risk, and the figure was expected to exceed five billion by 2025.\u000a\u000aThe analysis showed south and east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to be at highest risk.\u000a\u000aWhile Canada and the United States are low risk countries, a breakdown showed several areas in the US as highly vulnerable -- including the coastal regions of Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, South and North Carolina which are exposed to cyclones and storm surge.

Vis among the "extreme risk" countries of the world where economic impacts of climate change will be most keenly felt by 2025, according to new research released today.\u000a\u000aand are among the cities where the economic exposure to the impacts of extreme climate related events will be highest over the next 30 years, the report found.\u000a\u000aThe annual release of British risk consultancy Maplecroft's 'Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas' reveals that 31 per cent of global economic output will be based in countries facing "high" or "extreme risks" from the impacts of climate change by the year 2025.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), which forms a central part of the Atlas, this includes 67 countries whose estimated combined output of USD 44 trillion will come under increasing threat from the physical impacts of more frequent and extreme climate-related events, such as severe storms, flooding or drought.\u000a\u000aThe economic impacts of climate change will be most keenly felt by Bangladesh (1st and most at risk), Guinea-Bissau (2nd), Sierra Leone (3rd), Haiti (4th), South Sudan (5th), Nigeria (6th), DR Congo (7th), Cambodia (8th), Philippines (9th) and Ethiopia (10th), which make up the 10 most at risk countries out of the 193 rated by the CCVI.\u000a\u000aHowever, other important growth markets at risk include: (20th), Pakistan (24th) and Vietnam (26th) in the "extreme risk" category, in addition to Indonesia (38th), Thailand (45th), Kenya (56th) and, most significantly, China (61st), all classified at "high risk."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy 2025, China's GDP is estimated to treble from current levels to USD 28 trillion, while India's is forecast to rise to USD 5 trillion - totalling nearly 23 per cent of global economic output between them, according to the report.\u000a\u000aMaplecroft has also calculated the risks to the world's largest cities to pinpoint where the economic exposure will be highest over the next 30 years.\u000a\u000aAccording to the CCVI's sub-national calculations, of the 50 cities studied, five present an 'extreme risk' - Dhaka in Bangladesh; and in India; Manila in the Philippines and Thailand's Bangkok - while only London and Paris were classified as "low risk."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe report also said that India's economic exposure to the impacts of extreme climate related events was recently highlighted by Cyclone Phailin.\u000a\u000aThe storm caused an estimated USD 4.15 billion of damage to the agriculture and power sectors alone in the state of Odisha, which is also India's most important mining region, the report said.\u000a\u000a"Cyclone Phailin demonstrates the critical need for business to monitor the changing frequency and intensity of climate related events, especially where infrastructure and logistics are weak," said James Allan, Head of Environment at Maplecroft.

VHoly smoke from Hindu funeral pyres, Muslim cemeteries and Buddhist temples accounts for almost a quarter of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming on the Indian subcontinent and the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, according to a new study.\u000a\u000aResearchers have long suspected that the rituals of religious devotion in India, Nepal and South Asia, may be a factor in the level of brown carbon and soot which pollutes the air in the region, but until now little work has been done to quantify the size of the problem.\u000a\u000aAccording to researchers from Nevada's Desert Research Institute and the Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla University in Chhattisgarh, South East India, the impact is "huge" - 23 per cent of particles from human burnt fossil fuels in the atmosphere and a major source of carcinogenic volatile organic compounds.\u000a\u000aMuch of this pollution is overlooked because it is shrouded by human loss and religious worship and identity, but the research team has warned the scale of its environmental damage demands further study.\u000a\u000aBetween 2011 and 2012, the researchers measured emissions from marriage ceremonies, funeral cremations, incense sticks in temples and graveyards, and found mango bark, cow dung, camphor, leaves, vermillion, and cow urine being burned. They identified fourteen "deadly" volatile organic compounds, including formaldehyde, benzene, styrene and butadiene, they told Nature magazine.\u000a\u000aThey discovered that funeral pyres emitted large amounts of 'brown carbon aerosol' gases, regarded as the second largest contributor to global warming, which absorb sunlight and give out heat. Their dark particles settle on snow and glaciers causing them to warm and melt.\u000a\u000a"There are three million religious places of worship in India alone and over 10 million marriages take place every year in this country according to the 2011 census. When these results were multiplied to fit these scales, the quantum of emissions was just baffling," said researcher Shamsh Pervez.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aBrazil has proposed that the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) formally study the historical responsibility of countries for the accumulated greenhouse gas emissions on the basis of which the future emission reduction targets can be set. The proposal, which has found the backing of other BASIC countries \u2013 India, China and South Africa \u2013 will be formally discussed at the Warsaw talks beginning November 11.\u000a\u000aDeveloped countries, especially the United States, have till date refused to acknowledge the importance of accounting for the emissions accumulated in the atmosphere so far which are also referred to as \u2018stocks.\u2019 It prefers to negotiate only looking at current and future emission flows. The U.S. is the highest emitter of accumulated emissions so far and China, India and other emerging economies fall far behind the developed world. The principle of historical emissions is based on the scientific fact that carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 by far the largest greenhouse gas \u2013 once emitted, stay in the atmosphere for more than a 100 years and continue to heat up the planet.\u000a\u000aBrazil has now asked that IPCC \u2014 a pool of more than 2000 scientists working to compile the best of science on the issue \u2014 be also charged with developing a \u201cmethodology to enable Parties [countries] to quantify national historical contributions to climate change. Such reference methodology on historical responsibilities should guide domestic consultation process for defining mitigation contributions during the post-2020 period.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot new\u000a\u000aThe principle of historical emissions itself is not new. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate acknowledges its importance. The calculations of such emissions also exist widely in the public domain. But to get a formally recognised formulation for historical emissions from the U.N., IPCC holds great political and strategic value in the negotiations.\u000a\u000aIf the proposal gets approved at the Warsaw talks, it would ensure that the principle of historical emissions also gets more firmly embedded in the negotiations for the new climate pact to be signed by 2015 and becomes one of the parameters based on which countries are held responsible for doing less than the required levels to combat climate change. This would put a greater onus of action on the developed world than emerging economies. Accounting more for the current and future emissions \u2013 something the developed world prefers \u2013 would put the onus for costly climate reduction actions on emerging countries whose economies are growing and consuming an increasing amount of energy and fuel today.

VSome of the world\u2019s top climate scientists say wind and solar energy won\u2019t be enough to head off extreme global warming, and they\u2019re asking environmentalists to support the development of safer nuclear power as one way to cut fossil fuel pollution.\u000a\u000aFour scientists who have played a key role in alerting the public to the dangers of climate change sent letters Sunday to leading environmental groups and politicians around the world. The letter, an advance copy of which was given to The Associated Press, urges a crucial discussion on the role of nuclear power in fighting climate change.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists agree that global warming is a threat to ecosystems and humans, but many oppose nuclear power and believe that new forms of renewable energy will be able to power the world within the next few decades.\u000a\u000aThat isn\u2019t realistic, the letter said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose energy sources cannot scale up fast enough\u201d to deliver the amount of cheap and reliable power the world needs, and \u201cwith the planet warming and carbon dioxide emissions rising faster than ever, we cannot afford to turn away from any technology\u201d that has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aThe letter signers are James Hansen, a former top Nasa scientist; Ken Caldeira, of the Carnegie Institution; Kerry Emanuel, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Tom Wigley, of the University of Adelaide in Australia.\u000a\u000aHansen began publishing research on the threat of global warming more than 30 years ago, and his testimony before Congress in 1988 helped launch a mainstream discussion. Last February he was arrested in front of the White House at a climate protest that included the head of the Sierra Club and other activists. Caldeira was a contributor to reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Emanuel is known for his research on possible links between climate change and hurricanes, and Wigley has also been doing climate research for more than 30 years.\u000a\u000aEmanuel said the signers aren\u2019t opposed to renewable energy sources but want environmentalists to understand that \u201crealistically, they cannot on their own solve the world\u2019s energy problems.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of climate scientists say they\u2019re now virtually certain that pollution from fossil fuels has increased global temperatures over the last 60 years. They say emissions need to be sharply reduced to prevent more extreme damage in the future.\u000a\u000aIn 2011 worldwide carbon dioxide emissions jumped 3 percent, because of a large increase by China, the No. 1 carbon polluting country. The US is No. 2 in carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aHansen, who\u2019s now at Columbia University, said it\u2019s not enough for environmentalists to simply oppose fossil fuels and promote renewable energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re cheating themselves if they keep believing this fiction that all we need\u201d is renewable energy such as wind and solar, Hansen told the AP.\u000a\u000aThe joint letter says, \u201cThe time has come for those who take the threat of global warming seriously to embrace the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems\u201d as part of efforts to build a new global energy supply.\u000a\u000aStephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard professor who studies energy issues, said nuclear power is \u201cvery divisive\u201d within the environmental movement. But he added that the letter could help educate the public about the difficult choices that climate change presents.\u000a\u000aOne major environmental advocacy organization, the Natural Resources Defense Council, warned that \u201cnuclear power is no panacea for our climate woes.\u201d\u000a\u000aRisk of catastrophe is only one drawback of nuclear power, NRDC President Frances Beinecke said in a statement. Waste storage and security of nuclear material are also important issues, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe better path is to clean up our power plants and invest in efficiency and renewable energy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe scientists acknowledge that there are risks to using nuclear power, but say those are far smaller than the risk posed by extreme climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe understand that today\u2019s nuclear plants are far from perfect.\u201d

VAn Australian media report on said Australia and the US spied on Indonesia during UN climate change talks in 2007 (Reuters image)\u000a\u000aAustralia and the United States mounted a joint surveillance operation on Indonesia during the 2007 United Nations climate change conference in Bali, an Australian media report said on Sunday.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian newspaper's Australian edition cited a document from US whistleblower Edward Snowden showing Australian spy agency the Defence Signals Directorate worked alongside America's National Security Agency (NSA) to collect the phone numbers of Indonesian security officials. The revelation is likely to exacerbate already strained relations with Jakarta after reports last week that Canberra's overseas diplomatic posts were involved in a vast US-led surveillance network.\u000a\u000aMissions in Indonesia, as well as embassies or consulates in China, were reportedly used to monitor phone calls and collect data, sparking demands for an explanation from Jakarta and Beijing.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian said the 2007 operation was not particularly successful, with the only tangible outcome being the mobile phone number of Bali's chief of police.\u000a\u000a"The goal of the development effort was to gain a solid understanding of the network structure should collection be required in the event of an emergency," according to an account of the mission included in a 2008 weekly report from the NSA base at Pine Gap in Australia, one of the agency's biggest overseas bases.\u000a\u000aSumming up at the end of the operation, the NSA said: "Highlights include the compromise of the mobile phone number for Bali's chief of police.\u000a\u000a"Site efforts revealed previously unknown Indonesian communications networks and postured us to increase collection in the event of a crisis," according to The Guardian.\u000a\u000aWhile largely unsuccessful, the operation is hugely embarrassing for Australia.\u000a\u000aAt the time, Kevin Rudd was the country's newly elected prime minister and he attended the summit - his first high-profile international foray - at the personal invitation of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\u000a\u000aBoth leaders agreed at the time to work together to advance ties.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Islamists rally in Egypt ahead of referendum vote, 3 killed\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VThe shale gas revolution has made natural gas so cheap that it is displacing coal as a fuel.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPresident Obama\u2019s recently proposed regulations to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from new power plants have been much heralded by environmentalists because they would make new coal-fired power plants too costly to operate. In truth, they accomplish almost nothing. These rules would apply to new power plants only. But few new coal-fired power plants or units have been built in recent years because of the low price of natural gas, and few are planned over the next five years, according to the federal Energy Information Agency. Most modern gas-fired electric plants meet the standard the president is proposing, so the rules are irrelevant for them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo meet these new rules, proposed last month, new coal-fired power plants would have to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks before it is emitted and then send it by pipeline to a location where it would be pumped underground for long-term isolation. The Environmental Protection Agency says this technology, known as carbon capture and storage, can be made ready for large-scale use. But most experts - including me - would say \u201cnot yet,\u201d because it has not been tested at the required scale.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe shale gas revolution has made natural gas so cheap that it is displacing coal as a fuel for generating electricity. For utilities that burn natural gas, this has meant higher profits and lower costs for customers. Electricity production from coal has dropped from nearly 50 per cent of the total five years ago to under 40 per cent in 2012, while electricity from gas has risen from about 20 per cent five years ago to 30 per cent in 2012, according to the energy department.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPrice has tilted the playing field to make gas the preferred source of fuel for generating electricity, and because natural gas produces half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burned, this transition has already reduced emissions of the greenhouse gas in the United States. To speed the transition to gas, we could tilt the playing field more by imposing a tax on carbon emissions, but given the politics in Washington today, that is for another time.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs for capturing and storing carbon dioxide, the EPA cites as an example the oil industry\u2019s successful use of carbon dioxide captured from industrial smokestacks to stimulate the flow of oil out of old wells. But the EPA\u2019s point is irrelevant because the amount of capacity for storage of carbon dioxide in the old wells is tiny compared with what is produced in the generation of electricity, so the challenge is fundamentally different. There is potential large-capacity underground storage in deep saline aquifers, but no one knows if these can contain carbon dioxide for centuries without leaking. If I were on a technical panel recommending what to do, I would say that carbon capture and storage is not ready for large-scale use.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLimit mercury emissions\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat the EPA should do first is aggressively enforce limits on mercury emissions from power plants that were imposed in 2012. Those standards will be phased in over the next three to four years and should force the dirtiest of the old coal-fired power plants to shut down by requiring expensive new technology. Those plants had been exempted from limits on emissions of sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxide and have no scrubbers to capture those pollutants before they go up the smokestack. Newer plants, by contrast, have scrubbers that can be tweaked to take care of mercury.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNext, the administration should get serious about regulating carbon dioxide from existing power plants. President Obama has promised to develop standards for those plants in the coming months, though he says they will be less stringent than those for new plants.In addition, tests of carbon capture and storage technology need to be done at an appropriate scale, and if it works (which I doubt), it should be required at existing coal plants. This will further increase the cost of electricity at those plants, forcing more to close down.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFinally, administration officials, members of Congress and governors of all the states should read the National Academy of Sciences 2010 study called \u201cHidden Cost of Energy,\u201d which estimated that the damage to human health, grain crops, timber yields, buildings and recreation from coal-fired power plant emissions in 2005 cost the nation about $62 billion.\u000a\u000a

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aA draft text of a ministerial decision on the controversial phasing out of refrigerant and global warming gases \u2013 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) \u2013 circulating in the negotiations stirred debate on late Friday night on how the talks would progress over the week when the ministers from more than 130 countries gather at the National Stadium to thrash out compromises that require political guidance.\u000a\u000aThe source of the text, which was also accessed by The Hindu, could not be ascertained. The operative part of the on page text said that the countries should agree to adopting \u201cappropriate measures under the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer to progressively reduce the production and consumption of HFCs, based on, inter alia, an examination of economically viable and technically feasible alternatives, and to continue to include HFCs within the scope of the convention and its Kyoto Protocol for accounting and reporting of emissions.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn other words, it asked the countries to decide at the Warsaw meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that it would agree to let the global warming gas be dealt with under the Montreal Protocol, which deals with ozone-depleting substances so far and does not have the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities enshrined in it.\u000a\u000aThis is a controversial move that India, China and several other countries had successfully opposed at a recent meeting of the Montreal Protocol. While it\u2019s a proposal that has had the backing of the US, the EU and number of other developing and developed countries, it turned controversial especially this year. First there was a G20 declaration to which India and China \u2013 two of the fastest growing markets for refrigerant gases \u2013 signed up taking them a step closer to the HFC phase out under Montreal Protocol. Then on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s visit to Washington, the US pulled all stops to get him to sign on the dotted line for a faster decision on the phase out under Montreal Protocol. The diplomatic hard ball back-fired for the US, with India warning that the costs of transition and issues of control of alternative technology by few US-based companies had not been resolved. India stepped back and soon when the Montreal Protocol meeting happened in October it was able to block any hasty decision on this along with China, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Indonesia and about 10 other countries.\u000a\u000aThey warned that the technology was untested, extremely costly and in the hands of the few and the proposal would make India and China jump to costlier alternatives in time even as the developed world did a slow phase down of the gas.\u000a\u000aFailed at the Montreal Protocol, the developed countries and their other allies promised to reopen the subject at the Warsaw climate convention talks. The EU pushed from the early days at the negotiations without finding traction at the negotiators level. The five days of negotiations did not see any give in from the developing countries.\u000a\u000aNow this text has emerged on Friday night sending the developing countries that are opposed to the move as well as about how contentious issues would be dealt with in the high-level segment scurrying for consultations.\u000a\u000aA negotiator from the Like-Minded Developing Country Group, who had seen the draft ministerial decision, told The Hindu, \u201cWhile the origins of the text cannot be ascertained we know which parties are insistent on a decision on HFCs at Warsaw. It would be unfortunate if such drafts will emerge out of nowhere on contentious issues and suddenly find their way on to the tables before the ministers.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added, \u201cSo far we have seen Poland act as a presidency (head and hosts of the negotiations) should. We hope that no one resorts to non-transparent measures in the second week of negotiations either or the lack of trust in the process would only deepen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere have been incidents in the previous years too when the hosts tried to either clobber an agreement despite lack of consensus or by springing up draft agreements at the ministers on short notice. The attempts have been successful at times and failed on others but usually led to a lack of faith between the large country blocks over the years.\u000a\u000aDelegates from three countries in the G77+China countries that The Hindu contacted said they had not seen the draft text but had heard of it and some of their partners had been sounded out about the need for a discussion on the matter later on Friday night or over the weekend to strategise and be prepared for any surprises next week.

VFor a look at what climate change could do to the world's food supply, consider what the weather did to the American Corn Belt last year.\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of 2012, the Agriculture Department projected the largest corn crop in the country's history. But then a savage heat wave and drought struck over the summer. Plants withered, prices spiked, and the final harvest came in 27 per cent below the forecast.\u000a\u000aThe situation bore a striking resemblance to what happened in Europe in 2003, after a heat wave cut agricultural production for some crops by as much as 30 per cent and sent prices soaring.\u000a\u000aSeveral researchers concluded that the European heat wave was made more likely by human-caused climate change; scientists are still arguing over the 2012 heat blast in the United States. Whatever their origin, heat waves like these give us a taste of what could be in store in a future with global warming.\u000a\u000a"The negative impacts of global climate change on agriculture are only expected to get worse," said a report earlier this year from researchers at the London School of Economics and a Washington think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. The report cited a need for "more resilient crops and agricultural production systems than we currently possess in today's world".\u000a\u000aThis may be the greatest single fear about global warming: that climate change could so destabilise the world's food system as to lead to rising hunger or even mass starvation. Two weeks ago, a leaked draft of a report by the United Nations climate committee, known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, suggested that the group's concerns have grown, and that the report, scheduled for release in March, is likely to contain a sharp warning about risks to the food supply.\u000a\u000aThe tone is strikingly different from that of a report from the same group in 2007, which discussed some risks, but saw global warming as likely to benefit agriculture in many important growing regions.\u000a\u000aIn the years since, new scientific research has checked those assumptions.\u000a\u000aFor one, a group of young scientists has pioneered more sophisticated ways of analysing the relationship between agriculture and climate. People like David Lobell at Stanford and Wolfram Schlenker at Columbia have used elaborate statistical techniques to get a detailed picture of what heat does to crop yields. Their work suggests that rising heat stress in some major growing areas is already putting a drag on production, and raises the possibility of much more serious effects as global warming continues.\u000a\u000aScientists had long hoped that the effect of heat and water stress on crops might be offset by the very thing driving global warming: the sharp increase of carbon dioxide in the air. The gas is the main food supply for plants, and a large body of evidence suggested that the ongoing rise could boost crop yields.\u000a\u000aBut a lot of that evidence came from tests in artificial environments like greenhouses. Younger scientists, who insisted on testing crops in open-air conditions more closely resembling the real world, found that the bump in yield, while certainly real, was not as high as expected. And it may not be high enough to offset other stresses from global warming.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that agriculture has a tremendous capacity to adapt to new conditions, including a warming climate. Crops can be planted earlier, and new varieties that are more resistant to climate stress can be developed.\u000a\u000a"Our past successes in agriculture have lulled many of those in decision-making positions into a false sense of security," said L Val Giddings, a fellow with the Washington think tank and a co-author of its report. "It's been so long since any of them were actually hungry."\u000a\u000aALSO READ In Orissa\u2019s \u2018liberated\u2019 zone, two villages take on the Maoists\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VWARSAW: The devastation caused by Typhoom Haiyan in Philippines, which left as many as 3200 dead continues to cast a shadow on climate talks in Warsaw . Together with Philippines climate change commissioner and negotiator Yeb Sano\u2019s continuing fast at the UN climate change meet may have forced countries to move towards addressing the devastating impacts experienced by countries that have contributed the least to the problem.While the images from Philippines dominate the imagination at Warsaw, the adverse impacts of climate change are now becoming all to familiar. This year saw the devastation in Uttarakhand and Cyclone Phailin in India to droughts in Africa , and experts say that each of these disasters have been exacerbated by unchecked climate change caused by failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and inability of countries to adapt to changes caused by climate change.This has led to a situation, known in UN climate change negotiations parlance, of permanent \u201closs and damage\u201d. Proposed as a new pillar, beyond emission reduction and adapting to climate change, loss and damage implicitly places the blame of climate change at the doorstep of the industrialised countries.At Warsaw, government representatives have been working over the weekend to put in place a proposal that address ways to address the devastating impacts of climate change. The proposal will be taken up by ministers for discussions over the next week.Marcin Korolec, Poland's environment minister and president of the UN sponsored talks in Warsaw said earlier this week that the \u201closs and damage issue is part of the imminent political discussion. We are confident that we will have a decision \u2026 by the end of the conference next week. Although the positions of different countries today are quite different, there is room for consensus.\u201dThe proposal pushed by the developing countries bloc G-77 and China calls for an institutional mechanism to address global response to loss and damage. There has been strong opposition from the United States, which is concerned about possible litigation that would arise from accepting \u201closs and damage\u201d as something separate from adapting to climate change. Norwayhas also not been in favour of a new mechanism, while the European Union has been openly ambivalent.Talks late night on Saturday, saw the United States indicating that it was open to the idea of a transitional committee to begin the work towards setting up an institutional mechanism. A negotiator involved in the loss and damage talks said \u201cthe United States continues to oppose the idea of compensation for loss and damage, there are many other technical aspects of loss and damage that need to be address urgently and these even the US can\u2019t ignore.\u201dSources indicated that there is a move among industrialised countries to consider setting up an international mechanism to deal with the impact of extreme events like cyclones and typhoons and slow onset events like changing rainfall pattern in developing countries. The mechanism will have a technical facility to manage information and data as well as assist in the development of new tools and approaches and help build capacity to address the loss and damage resulting from adverse effects of climate change.\u201cThe ministers will take a call on the institutional mechanism for loss and damage. We want to see a repeat of the unity among the developing countries as we saw in Doha,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, international co-ordinator, Action AidWith scientists now more sure than ever before that human activity is responsible for climate change, it is now clear that countries that have contributed to the least to climate change are most vulnerable to its impacts. There has been a growing demand from the developing countries to address these devastating impacts of climate change, which cant be tackled by reducing emissions and adapting to the changes.\u201cStrong institutional mechanism on loss and damage will eventually drive stronger action on emission reduction and adapting to climate change,\u201d said Singh.

VWARSAW: World may be looking at India for its response to what had happened recently in Odisha and Uttarakhand due to natural disasters which were results of climatic extremes, but there was not a word on these two unfortunate incidents from Indian side, comprising official negotiators, here at the UN climate change conference during the first week of this mega event that would eventually culminate into a global climate deal in Paris in 2015.Neither the Indian government 's open statement nor the negotiators' remarks during various rounds of discussions could mention how the country was equally vulnerable to such climate disasters caused by global warming.Even the move of Philippines \u2014 that had left the participants from 195 countries stunned on the opening day of the Conference on November 11 when head of the country's delegation, Yab Sano, broke down to tears while putting across his government's point of view referring to Typhoon Haiyan \u2014 has failed to shake up Indian side.The typhoon had seen killing of over 10,000 persons that struck the country just two days before the beginning of the conference.Observers who have been closely keeping track of developments during the 19th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP) here at National Stadium at heart of Poland's capital are puzzled. They don't know whether the Indian move was just a result of negotiators' disinterest or a ploy to keep the sensitive issue on hold till the Indian environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan arrives here to take part in the high-level ministerial round of the conference which will conclude on November 22.It is learnt that Natarajan, who is expected to come here on Tuesday, may mention these two disasters \u2014 Odisha and Uttarakhand \u2014 in her formal statement a day after while asking the developed countries to look at various concerns of developing world. The issues may be raised to tell the world that New Delhi is conscious of how the climate change due to global warning is causing disasters beyond boundaries.The silence of Indian official negotiators, so far, over such disasters that left over 5,000 people killed in Uttarakhand due to floods and lakhs of people homeless\u005cdisplaced in Odisha due to Cyclone Phailin made Indian NGOs here both intrigued and nervous.They expressed that the Indian government side could have told the world that the country too was victim of disasters like what had happened in Philippines while referring to Odisha and Uttarakhand disasters and therefore it was very much conscious of the impact of global warming.Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, "Everyone is talking about Philippines...no one is talking about India. I think this is an attitude problem of Indian negotiators".Bhushan, climate change expert who has been keeping track of all negotiations here, said thousands of people were killed in Uttarakhand but not a word from Indian side on climate disasters in India.Other Indian civil society groups too have similar grudge. The CSE, in its part, will hold a pictorial exhibition on sidelines of the Conference, highlighting the disasters that struck India and pitch for government's response to fight the menace of global warming.Striking a chord with participants from developing and least developed countries, the Philippines' head of delegation, Sano, had in his emotional speech on last Monday appealed the rich countries to deliver on their promise to commit $100 billion, beginning 2020, to help developing countries cope with the impacts of climate change. He urged the nations not to stop "until there is assurance on finance for adaptation".The pledge for $100 billion per annum beginning 2020 \u2014 meant for adaptation or reduction of future emissions by developing countries \u2014 has, however, caused lot of heartburns among the rich nations who want a market-based mechanism to deal with the issue where they want private players to take the lead without government's direct role.The developing countries, including India, want the developed nations to establish a "loss and damage" mechanism to ensure that the climate-damaging greenhouse gases' emissions are stabilized. They argue that the mechanism should be based on the premise that the rich nations, who were responsible for high GHG emission during industrialization period, must pay not only for the "damage" caused by them but also for the "loss" which the developing countries might have suffered during their efforts to switch over the new climate-friendly but costly technology.It is to be seen whether Natarajan would effectively put forth these points and drive home a message that India continues to take lead in safeguarding interests of developing countries. Certainly, she won't dilute country's position when she joins the Conference here \u2014 specially when India is going to face a general election in next four months to elect a new government.

VIndia must wield the equity principle to shape the climate agenda, not to guard against mitigation commitments.\u000a\u000aThe UN climate negotiations in Warsaw, which were expected to be little more than a pit stop en route to the 2015 climate agreement slated to be reached in Paris, proved to be more interesting than billed. The odds were admittedly stacked against a successful conclusion to the conference. Japan, in the wake of the Fukushima disaster and its zero-nuclear move, revised its greenhouse gas targets from -25 per cent to +3 per cent from 1990 levels. Australia is in the process of abolishing its carbon tax. The developed countries have contributed a mere $7.5 million to the Green Climate Fund, as against their goal of mobilising $100 billion per year by 2020. The atmosphere, tainted by broken promises, was rife with discontent and distrust.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Warsaw, halfway from Durban to Paris, needed to register a step change in the process \u2014 from the airing of differences to negotiating them. It also needed to create the conditions necessary to reach an agreement in 2015. The parties, in 2014, need to engage in the domestic preparations necessary to arrive at commitments that can be inscribed in the 2015 agreement. The Copenhagen Accord and the Cancun Agreements led to the qualified and conditional pre-2020 greenhouse gas mitigation pledges of breathtaking diversity, dubious rigour and limited climate impact. To avoid this post 2020, most countries in Warsaw argued for clear informational requirements to be laid out in relation to the parties' commitments. Some countries also lobbied for a process to develop accounting rules. The application of informational requirements and accounting rules to commitments would facilitate clarity, enable comparability, create the conditions necessary to ratchet up countries' commitments and ensure environmental integrity. In addition, several countries argued that the parties' commitments should be subject to an international assessment process that could test the commitments, individually and in the aggregate, for adequacy \u2014 against the goal of not allowing global temperatures to rise more than two degrees celsius \u2014 and equitable burden sharing.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ The taper tigers\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VArun M By\u000a\u000aPrisons in the State which adopted a \u2018go-green\u2019 mantra, are likely to win carbon credits under United Nations\u2019 (UN) Clean Development Mechanism, which incentivise agencies that cut down on greenhouse emissions.\u000a\u000aBy switching over completely to solar energy and introducing organic farming, planting trees and treating sewage, the Prison Department has saved 960 tonnes of carbon dioxide this year and will be entitled for `7 lakh, officials said. The project assumes significance as the state is eyeing top slots in the gross income from jails and per capita earnings of jail inmates in the national level.\u000a\u000aJail DGP Alexander Jacob told \u2018Express\u2019 that the Union Ministry of External Affairs will send the records regarding to this to UN officials soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe department had mooted the idea in 2011. But we realised it this year. With the success of the solar project, the jail department is eligible for nearly 1,000 carbon credits. The department has saved 960 tonnes of carbon dioxide by introducing solar based cooking and other measures in the first attempt itself,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe UN launched the scheme under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for emission reduction projects as defined by the Kyoto Protocol. In these projects, the emission so reduced is converted to saleable credits known as Certified Emission Reductions (CER). Each CER certificate is equivalent to a tonne of carbon dioxide, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto Protocol targets.\u000a\u000aAccording to Prison Department officials, they are using solar energy for cooking in all 52 jails across the state and stopped relying on steam cooking and LPG cylinders.\u000a\u000aBesides this, the authorities have planted as many as 40,000 trees in the jail premises. Biogas digesters were set up in the jails for treating the sewage water and recovering methane from it to generate biogas, used for cooking food.\u000a\u000aBy adopting organic farming, the prison authorities are applying natural farming techniques, avoiding the use of pesticides, urea and other chemical manures which in turn cuts down the methane release.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith all these projects we are cutting down the carbon level to a great extend. Once these projects become full-fledged the department can earn a sum of `one million per year under carbon credit scheme,\u201d said Alexander Jacob.\u000a\u000aRecently, in the 163 acre compound of Nettukaltheri open jail, the department planted rubber, which would add to the carbon credits and help generate an income of `6 crore after seven years.

VThe Pune Municipal Corporation has decided to be a part of the US-based Climate and Clean Air Coalition initiative (CCAC), set up under the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), in a bid to work towards reducing carbon emission from solid waste.\u000a\u000aUnder CCAC, cities across the world will address the issue of how to reduce the level of pollution, which has led to climate change, from the waste generated. "Methane, carbon and other pollutants generated from waste are contributing to climate change. The CCAC initiative is focussing on solid waste management and disposing it scientifically," Municipal Commissioner Mahesh Pathak said in the proposal tabled before the standing committee.\u000a\u000aExperts, civic officers and office-bearers of various cities involved in framing the policy are brought together under CCAC to address this issue, he said. The initiative will look at data collection on solid waste management, its scientific analysis and exploring the scientific measures for waste disposal, Pathak added.\u000a\u000a"The benefit of joining CCAC will help the city in sharing knowledge and technical support among the different cities. This will enable civic representatives to attend workshops and seminars on this issue," said Vishal Tambe, chairperson of PMC standing committee. The CCAC will also provide PMC a platform adopt practices implemented in other cities, he added.\u000a\u000aALSO READ PMPML decides to appoint experts for dedicated BRTS cell\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VGOING FORWARD: As India will be one of the most severely affected countries by climate change, it would be in its best interests to understand the issue better and join forces with other developing countries.\u000a\u000aIndia joined nearly 140 countries in staging a walkout during the recent climate negotiations in Warsaw to oppose the attempt to avoid creating a strong institutional mechanism to address \u201closs and damage.\u201d In the final moments of the conference, however, some form of compromise was found on loss and damage as well as a future course of action to \u201cinitiate or intensify domestic preparations for their intended nationally determined contributions\u201d to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Notwithstanding India\u2019s overt solidarity with other developing countries, its lack of engagement in discussions on loss and damage indicates that it does not have a clear understanding of the broader ethical and political implications of the concept, nor how it could be important strategically.\u000a\u000aImpact of extreme weather\u000a\u000aThe term \u201closs and damage\u201d was introduced into international climate negotiations by small island nations and least developed countries in Cancun in 2010, and is now formally a part of the language of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As a legal concept, it conveys the historical liability for climate change that is largely borne by the rich countries of the world. During the past century-and-a-half or so, carbon has been mined in enormous quantities from the depths of the earth and burned in engines generating vast amounts of goods and services while releasing about two trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide, much of which remains in the atmosphere today. Developed regions such as the United States, Europe and Japan are responsible for more than two-thirds of the stock of carbon dioxide, with the remaining portion due to India, China and the rest of the developing world.\u000a\u000aClimate change is expected to cause severe droughts in some parts of the world and flooding in others, and coastal erosion and an increased frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones, tornadoes, storm surges and heatwaves. One of the sad ironies, however, is that the countries that have emitted the least amount of greenhouse gases will suffer the worst impacts due to warming. People living on small islands, delta regions, those who will suffer droughts and floods and extreme events, are, for the most part, from poor countries, and the poorest from among them will be the worst affected. Bangladesh, which has been a minuscule contributor of greenhouse gases, will have most of its people at risk due to climate change.\u000a\u000aCompensation\u000a\u000a\u201cLoss and damage\u201d entails claims by the developing world from rich countries to provide compensation for the \u201closses and irreversible damage, including non-economic losses\u201d (taken from G77 and China\u2019s submission to COP 19 on loss and damage) associated with climate change. The idea is taken directly from tort law, which is probably why North America, Europe and Australia have been virulently opposed to having a separate track discuss the issue. Part of the problem is that the notion of loss and damage might also include non-monetary forms of compensation, whose character might sometimes be unclear. For instance, if small island nations like the Maldives and Kiribati were to become submerged as a result of sea level rise from climate change, the resulting disappearance of these nation states would require unusual measures of recompense, including mass migration to other countries and citizenship rights for the migrants, rather than just money.\u000a\u000aIn cases of civil negligence, in the U.S., but also elsewhere, courts have long established that where a proximate cause to a loss can be established, whether the action was intentional or not, the perpetrator will bear the liability and will have to pay for damages. This means that if enshrined in international law, the countries most responsible for historically caused losses associated with climate change will have to provide the most compensation for various identified damages that will mostly be in developing countries.\u000a\u000aFor India\u000a\u000aIndia has long recognised the importance of equity in the climate dialogue, by stressing Article 3.1 of the Convention, which speaks of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.\u201d India\u2019s stance has been that every person should have equal access to development, implying an equal share of the earth\u2019s carbon budget. That is to say, if carbon dioxide emissions were to be reduced globally, the rich should be the first and fastest to do so and the poor, the last. India has used its low per capita emissions to push the point that its engagement in emissions reductions efforts should be deferred until after countries with higher per capita emissions reduce theirs. Since the global climate negotiations in Durban, however, the centrality of this position has been shaken, in part because of a new understanding of the urgency and severity of global emissions reductions needed to avert climate catastrophe and also because of shifts in political positions.\u000a\u000aLoss and damage belongs to the same overall framework of climate justice. For one thing, India will be one of the most severely affected countries by climate change, given its sheer size, climatic geography and the impacts associated with Himalayan glacier melt, droughts in various regions, coastal vulnerability from sea level rise, reductions in agricultural production, livelihood loss for the poor, increased severity of cyclones, and potential threats to the entire monsoon system. For another, compensation or reparation for damages associated with any country\u2019s contribution to historical emissions amounts to a \u201cduty to make amends\u201d rather than an act of charity.\u000a\u000aPaying attention to \u201closs and damage\u201d from historical emissions maintains equity with regard to the current \u201cstock\u201d of the carbon space that has been unequally distributed among countries. With regard to \u201cflows\u201d or annual emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, India may want to join with other countries to develop a separate equity-based agreement that is consistent with its own understanding of climate justice. India itself may not be in a position to claim damages, depending on how its own responsibilities and capabilities are accounted for, but it is nevertheless in its clearest interest to understand the issue better and join forces with other developing countries.\u000a\u000a(Sujatha Byravan and Sudhir Chella Rajan are based in Chennai and work on climate change policy.)

VHimalayan flowers have evolved to attract bees as pollinators, scientists have found for the first time.\u000a\u000aThe study has implications for understanding the effects of climate change on plant pollination.\u000a\u000aBiologists from Monash University and RMIT University investigated the evolution of flower colours due to the bee's colour vision.\u000a\u000aThey researched in the understudied Nepalese steep mountainous terrain, and other subtropical environments.\u000a\u000aAssociate Professor Adrian Dyer of Monash and RMIT said previous studies had shown that flower colour evolved to attract bees as pollinators in temperate environments, but the story for either subtropical or steep mountainous environments had been unknown.\u000a\u000a"Mountainous environments provide an ideal natural experiment to understand the potential effects of changing climatic conditions on plant-pollinator interactions, since many pollinators show preferences for localised conditions, and major pollinators like honeybees do not tend to forage at high altitudes," Dyer said.\u000a\u000aDr Mani Shrestha from Monash University and his colleague Prakash Bhattrai from the Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, collected spectral data from more than 100 flowering plants in Nepal over a range of altitudes, from 900 metres to over 4000 metres.\u000a\u000aUsing computer models to examine flower colours as bees would see them, the team addressed how pollinator vision had shaped flower evolution.\u000a\u000aThen, with associate professor Martin Burd, of the Monash University's School of Biological Sciences, they did phylogenetic analyses to identify how altitude zones affected results.\u000a\u000aShrestha said flowers from both subtropical (900-2000m) and alpine (3000-4100m) regions showed evidence of having evolved colour spectral signatures to enhance discrimination by bee pollinators.\u000a\u000a"The finding was a surprise as flies are thought to be the main pollinator in many mountain regions, but it appears that in the Himalayas several bee species are also active at high altitude, and these insects have been such effective pollinators that they have led to the evolution of distinctive bee-friendly colours," Shrestha said.\u000a\u000aThe research could shed light on how flower colours may continue to evolve in particular environments, depending upon the availability of the most effective pollinators.\u000a\u000aWhile 'bee colours' were prevalent at all elevations, flower colours in high altitude zones were more diverse and had more often undergone larger steps of evolutionary change than those at lower elevation, Burd said.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the Journal of Ecology.

VBrussels: European Union countries approved an agreement with China to curb imports of Chinese solar panels, ending the EU\u2019s biggest commercial dispute of its kind.\u000a\u000aEU governments endorsed an accord struck by their trade chief and China in July that sets a minimum price and a volume limit on European imports of Chinese solar panels until the end of 2015. Chinese manufacturers that take part will be spared EU tariffs meant to counter alleged below-cost sales, a practice known as dumping, and subsidies.\u000a\u000aThe verdict seeks to balance demands by European producers such as Solarworld AG for trade protection and opposition by China, some EU governments and Europe\u2019s importers to levies on the renewable-energy technology. The two-year duration of the measures is less than half as long as the normal five-year period for EU anti-dumping and anti-subsidy protection.\u000a\u000aEuropean solarM-panel manufacturers suffered material injury as a result of dumping by Chinese exporters and trade- distorting government aid to them, while trade protection must also take account of the cost for other economic operators, the 28-nation bloc said today in Brussels. The decision wraps up two inquiries begun more than a year ago and will take effect after being published in the EU\u2019s Official Journal within a week.\u000a\u000aIn Europe, which accounts for about three-quarters of the global photovoltaic market, more than two dozen manufacturers have sought protection from creditors since 2010 and many have shifted production to lower-cost plants in Asia.\u000a\u000aPolitical agenda\u000a\u000aThe EU push to restrain Chinese competition jumped to the top of the political agenda in Europe\u2019s capitals and Beijing this year as Chinese manufacturers and European importers warned about price increases. The dumping and subsidy probes covered EU imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels, and cells and wafers used in them\u2014 shipments valued at \u20ac21 billion ($29 billion) in 2011.\u000a\u000aWith Chinese companies such as Yingli Energy (China) Co., Wuxi Suntech Power Co. and Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. controlling 80% of the EU solar-panel market, China\u2019s government threatened to retaliate by imposing punitive duties of its own on imports from Europe of polysilicon\u2014 a material used in solar panels\u2014 and wine.\u000a\u000aIn a further sign of the political sensitivity of the European dumping and subsidy cases, today\u2019s EU verdict excludes wafers from the scope of the measures.\u000a\u000aMinimum price\u000a\u000aThe two-year trade protection is based on a provisional accord negotiated on 27 July by EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and China. That deal fixed a minimum price of 56 euro cents a watt for annual imports from China of as much as 7 gigawatts and exempted Chinese companies willing to take part from preliminary punitive EU import duties.\u000a\u000aThe pact covers more than 90 Chinese exporters that have about 60% of the EU solar-panel market. Participating producers include Yingli Energy, Wuxi Suntech, Changzhou Trina Solar Energy, Jiangsu Aide Solar Energy Technology Co., Delsolar (Wujiang) Ltd., ERA Solar Co., Jiangsu Green Power PV Co. and Konca Solar Cell Co.\u000a\u000aAfter the preliminary deal reached by De Gucht four months ago on a minimum price and volume limit, a number of additional exporters in China requested to be included, the EU said today.\u000a\u000aThe participating Chinese exporters will be exempted from anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties being fixed definitively. Depending on the company, the two-year definitive anti-dumping levies range from 27.3% to 64.9%, while the anti- subsidy rates are from 3.5% to 11.5%.\u000a\u000aFlat rate\u000a\u000aThe provisional anti-dumping duties, after an initial flat rate of 11.8% between June 6 and 6 August, ranged from 37.3% to 67.9%. No provisional anti-subsidy levies were introduced.\u000a\u000aThe July agreement angered EU solar-panel producers, which wanted the minimum import price to be higher and the volume limit to be tighter.\u000a\u000aEU ProSun, which represents around 40 European solar-panel producers including Solarworld of Germany, said at the time that the provisional accord was unacceptable and vowed to file a lawsuit. The group lodged the complaints against China that led to the dumping and subsidy investigations by De Gucht\u2019s department in the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm. BLOOMBERG

VUntiring in his quest to change the way the world consumes energy, 58-year old Vinod Khosla has in the last decade backed startups developing energy efficiency products, healthcare solutions and alternative foods. His eponymously-named fund, Khosla Ventures, which raised $1.3 billion (Rs 8,100 crore) in 2011, boasts an eclectic portfolio ranging from precision agriculture to internal combustion engines. Doggedness and an ability to embrace failure have made this IIT-Delhi graduate one of the most celebrated investors in Silicon Valley. The winner of The Economic Times Global Indian of the Year 2013 award, Khosla shared his thoughts on his investment philosophy with ET in an email interview. Edited Excerpts\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHow do you see the future of energy?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is possible the existing technology will be able to handle the growth in demand for energy and resources, but they will do so only at an increasing cost. This places a growing drag on the economy in the long-term and will create an increased systemic risk. Instead, we can invent and commercialise new technologies that provide far better alternatives to the current methods. We have to focus on inventing resource \u201cmultipliers\u201d instead of just trying to \u201cdiscover\u201d more oil. We need inventions across a broad range of sustainable technologies, including utility-scale clean energy generation like solar thermal, distributed generation like rooftop solar or efficient power generation engines for buildings, more efficient engines, batteries, biofuels, biochemicals, new materials like glass that block light at the push of abutton, as well as food and agriculture systems.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhich of these will prove to be most impactful in the next few years?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSpecifics here are impossible to predict with any real accuracy. However, we can point to a few key fundamental energy needs that we have to solve. Distributed storage and generation just makes sense, and I suspect we will see a lot of breakthroughs here. We\u2019ve got to get off our reliance on conventional oil, and I\u2019m a big supporter of alternative fuels. New battery technology is the single key enabler for electric cars, and we will likely see more coming out of this area as well. I wish nuclear, especially fusion, were on the list but that seems somewhat unlikely.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat role do you see for innovation in the food sector?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe have to solve the animal husbandry problem. Meat production requires the most amount of land and a disproportionately large amount of other resources. One kilogram of red meat takes 7.25 kg of grain and more than 6,800 litre of water, and 4.4 megajoule of energy to produce. This is a very resourceintense process and animal farming contributes 18% of all greenhouse gas effects. This can be made more efficient and innovation is the only path for solving this. We will see a lot of change throughout the food supply chain. There\u2019s already been a lot of work done at the seed level, but we will see more when it comes to farming, the creation of products that are nearly perfect replacements for meat from taste down to the cooking process itself as well as information technology areas, referred to as precision agriculture.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhich sectors will receive most dollars from Khosla Ventures in future and why?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s impossible to plan ahead when it comes to innovation. We have invested into a number of promising new areas including healthcare, new computing platforms, robotics and food but there is still a lot to do in internet and mobile as well. We continue to invest in sustainability, but it\u2019s even harder to predict there because so much depends on large scientific breakthroughs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VPeru has already lost 39 per cent of its tropical glaciers due to a 0.7 degree C temperature rise in the Andes between 1939 and 2006. Aview of a lake filled with glacial melt water near Chopicalqui Mountain in Huaraz, Peru.\u2014 PHOTO: REUTERS\u000a\u000aThe Peruvian Amazon became a net emitter of carbon dioxide rather than oxygen for the first time in 2012, according to the U.N. Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) latest human development country report.\u000a\u000aThe reversal of the rainforest\u2019s usual role as a carbon sink is a direct result of the droughts in the western Amazon in 2005 and 2010 \u2014 and a stark reminder, say scientists, that this mega-biodiverse country is highly vulnerable to climate change.\u000a\u000aPeru, which has four of the five geographical areas most vulnerable to climate change \u2014 ranging from fragile mountain ecosystems to low-lying coastal areas \u2014 will host the 20th U.N. climate change conference in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe 2013 UNDP report warned that Peru\u2019s climate change vulnerability could undo the advances it has made in channelling economic growth into sustained poverty reduction. Peru\u2019s poverty rates have been more than halved over the past decade, dropping from 48.5 per cent of the population in 2004 to 25.8 per cent in 2012, according to the World Bank.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we disregard [environmental] sustainability, whatever progress we have made in poverty reduction or improvement of human development will just be erased due to climate change,\u201d cautioned Maria Eugenia Mujica, one of the UNDP report\u2019s authors.\u000a\u000aPeru has already lost 39 per cent of its tropical glaciers due to a 0.7 degree C temperature rise in the Andes between 1939 and 2006. But, the report noted, with a predicted temperature rise of up to six degree C in many parts of the Andes by the end of this century, there will be \u201charmful impacts on human development\u201d.\u000a\u000aPeru, which contributes just 0.4 per cent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, was ranked third after Bangladesh and Honduras, in climate hazards risks by the U.K.\u2019s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.\u000a\u000aWhat could be pushing Peru to the brink, researchers warned, is that its economic boom is inextricably linked to activities that damage the environment and contribute to climate change.\u000a\u000aIllicit activities such as illegal gold mining and logging, and the cocaine trade \u2014 all of which are environmentally destructive but lucrative \u2014 are economic drivers in many regions of the country, boosting incomes and, ironically, human development. A marked increase in the human development ranking in Peru\u2019s Amazon region \u2014 measured in increased income \u2014 was largely linked to environmentally destructive and illegal coca growing and gold mining, the latter of which also damages human health.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe growth does not come from education or health, but from predatory activities, like [resource] extraction and mining,\u201d said Francisco Santa Cruz, another of the report\u2019s authors.\u000a\u000aAs a result of high global gold prices combined with the widespread nature of the informal economy, illegal and artisanal mining now occurs in 21 of Peru\u2019s 25 regions.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, the rise in income has not been accompanied by an improvement in health and education, the two other key indicators in measuring human development. Consequently, Peru\u2019s 28 per cent human development growth between 1980 and 2012 is more lopsided than it might appear.\u000a\u000a\u201cDespite stellar economic growth, the fact that human development is falling or stalled in one of every 10 districts shows the need for Peru to promote inclusive growth and rights,\u201d said the U.K.-based Peru Support Group.\u000a\u000aPeru has called its hosting of next year\u2019s COP summit an opportunity to change the world. Its heightened sensitivity to climate change makes it, perhaps, the perfect location for a summit on which rest the hopes of so many nations. \u2014  Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2013

VPolicymaking in India is more often than not credited for its high nuisance value, rather than for positively aiding growth. Whether oil & gas, power, mining or any other core sector of the economy, government policy has frequently hampered rather than assisted the positive development of these industries. There is however one segment of the renewable energy space \u2013 solar power, that\u2019s vastly benefitted from concerted government action in the past few years that is paying off in a big way now.\u000a\u000aA new report titled 'Paving the Way for a Transformational Future: Lessons from Phase' predicts India will become a global leader in the development of and credits a lot of its success to the centre\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) and individual state missions for helping India take giant leaps in implementing its green agenda.\u000a\u000aTHE ACHIEVEMENTS\u000a\u000aSince its launch 3 years ago, installed capacity of in India has increased from a meagre 30 MW to more than 2000 MW. More importantly, cost of solar energy, which at one point was prohibitively unaffordable has come down to as little as Rs 3.5 crore per megawatt or Rs 3.5 per kWh according to the Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute (GERMI) from around Rs 15 per kWh when the mission was launched, making India one of the lowest cost destinations for grid-connected solar photo-voltaic (PV) power.\u000a\u000aTwo unique features of the government\u2019s mission have led to this transformation according to the\u000a\u000aA) High cost was bundled with lower cost unallocated thermal power to reduce the net average cost of electricity for distributers and end consumers, making solar energy more affordable.\u000a\u000aB) Introduction of reverse auctioning (where sellers typically decrease prices to undercut each other and offer the lowest bid to the buyer) led to fierce competition for contracts and developers drove down prices by giving significant discounts to (Central Electricity Regulatory Authority) set benchmark tariffs during bidding.\u000a\u000aA global decline of prices in solar components further aided developers to reduce tariffs, making the prospect of solar energy attractive and viable.\u000a\u000aTHE ROAD AHEAD: CHALLENGES & BARRIERS\u000a\u000aClearly while the first phase of the mission which had a conservative 1000 MW target has been a resounding success, the overall objectives of are ambitious, with targeted installed capacity of 20 GW or 20,000 MW by 2022. A number of challenges need to be addressed if these targets are to be met says the\u000a\u000a1) Bank Financing: For starters, a majority of the funding under the first phase of was through multi-lateral organizations, or even on recourse basis. Bank financing was virtually absent as bankers were concerned about the viability of solar as a technology. However absence of financing from scheduled commercial banks remains the biggest worry going ahead as funding requirements have escalated sharply to $4.1 billion for phase II of JNNSM where 3,600 MW of capacity will be added through the central scheme and 6,400 MW under state schemes.\u000a\u000a2) Implementation Bottlenecks: The age old problems of land acquisition, delays in state level clearances, and inadequate water and power evacuation infrastructure continues to be a drag on this sector as well. Land acquisition in particular is an issue given the large tracts of land required for setting up solar plants.\u000a\u000a3) Commercial Viability: The bundling mechanism whereby 1000 MW of solar power was bundled with 1000 MW of NTPC\u2019s thermal power to drive down costs is no longer an option with limitations on unallocated power available. Payment security for solar developers from SEBs also remains a concern since NTPC\u2019s trading arm which guarded against default from distribution entities will no longer guarantee refuge without a bundling mechanism in place. The enforcement of renewable purchase obligations (RPOs) whereby SEBs have to buy a certain portion of their power from green sources has also been tardy due to the financial health of distribution companies.\u000a\u000aThere are also niggling technology issues and problems in developing a manufacturing base for solar components that need to be attended to according to the report which recommends developing solar parks like Charanka in Gujarat to help increase efficiency and lower costs, rather than focus on standalone projects.\u000a\u000aWith no respite in sight for gas based power plants, coal shortage issues still remaining unresolved, a peak power deficit of 9% and the demand-supply rift in the power sector is only expected to widen further, it seems imperative for India to continue giving a thrust to renewable sources and address the impediments to mitigate its power woes.\u000a\u000aA growing backlash against India which has been obstructing progress on international climate talks is another reason why meeting voluntary goals on emissions is absolutely vital. According to a report on www.slate.com, India recently overtook to become the world\u2019s third-biggest greenhouse gas polluter. Though we are still behind and the United States in this dubious distinction, our growing reluctance to commit to reducing carbon emissions on a global stage is angering developing countries who are quickly losing patience with India\u2019s \u2018obstructionist\u2019 tactics.\u000a\u000aIn this backdrop, sustaining the momentum of the solar mission, which can become a critical showpiece for India\u2019s effort to address climate change on global forums is an imperative.

VWASHINGTON: Emissions of sulphur dioxide - atmospheric pollutant with health and climate impacts - from power plants in India increased by over 60 per cent between 2005 and 2012, new data analysed by a Nasa satellite found.In 2010, India surpassed the US as the world's second highest emitter of SO2 after China, according to estimates previously published by Zifeng Lu of Argonne National Laboratory, and other scientists.The same research showed that about half of India's emissions came from the coal-fired power sector, Nasa said.Researchers have drafted a map that depicts sulphur dioxide concentrations in 2011-12 and 2005, and the relative size of power plants in India.While some atmospheric SO2 is produced by volcanoes and other natural processes, a substantial amount is produced by human activities such as the combustion of fuels with sulphur- containing impurities and the smelting of metals such as copper and nickel, researchers said.The gas contributes to the formation of acid rain and, in high concentrations, can cause respiratory problems. It is also a precursor for sulfate aerosols, a type of suspended particle that can affect the properties of clouds - an effect that is difficult to measure and remains a large point of uncertainty in climate models.India's Central Pollution Control Board noted in a 2012 report that the national mean concentration of sulphur dioxide had declined from 2001 to 2010, an estimate based on data from ground-based monitoring stations, researchers said.However, most of the stations are located in urban areas, where regulations have indeed reduced pollution locally. Only some of the stations in India collect measurements near the source of power plant emissions, they said."We should know the air quality not only in populated cities, but also in industrial areas, where coal-fired power plants truly dominate national sulphur dioxide emissions," said Lu.The new analysis of sulphur dioxide emissions comes two years after researchers developed a method to observe power plant emissions using measurements captured by an instrument on the Aura satellite.The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measures ozone and other key air quality components - including sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide - and collects data over the same locations at the same time daily.Using OMI's eight-year record of observations, Lu and colleagues averaged measurements of sulphur from 65 power plants in 23 regions.Over time, a pattern emerged that allowed scientists to distinguish nearly constant power plant emissions from more variable background concentrations of sulphur dioxide.The study was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.

VLike a porpoise on the prowl, the sleek submersible HUGIN tracks its prey with sonar chirps. But the hunter set loose in the waters of the North Sea is not pursuing fish - the robot is trawling for geological clues that could help determine whether billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide can be stored below the sea floor for centuries, keeping it from warming the planet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, the latest data from the autonomous underwater vehicle and other tools deployed by the European Commission\u2019s $13.8-million ECO2 research project suggest that the plan might not be so simple. The seabed is fractured and scarred more than researchers had appreciated - providing potential routes for CO2 to leak from sub-seabed reservoirs where it is currently being stored. \u201cWe are saying it is very likely something will come out in the end,\u201d says Klaus Wallmann, ECO2 coordinator and a marine geochemist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSuch a conclusion could raise problems for the field of carbon capture and storage, especially in Europe, where any suggestion of leakage could reduce public support for the strategy. But ECO2 researchers say that evidence from oil-industry carbon-storage efforts already under way in the North Sea and Barents Sea suggests no hint of leakage, and that there would be little cause for concern even if there were. \u201cWe are very confident that if it were to occur, the rates would be low and the impact would be minimal,\u201d says Wallmann, who presented the findings of the ECO2 team on December 9 at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOil companies have long injected CO2 into underground formations to enhance oil production, but the ECO2 project is studying sites where the gas is pumped below the sea floor to keep it out of the atmosphere. One of the biggest operations is in the Sleipner natural-gas field in the North Sea, run by the energy company Statoil, headquartered in Stavanger, Norway.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 1996, the company has separated CO2 gas from the desired hydrocarbons and reinjected up to 1 million tons of CO2 a year into the Utsira formation, a layer of porous sandstone more than 800 meters below the sea floor. The giant formation, which covers an area of 24,000 square kilometers, has the potential to hold 600 billion tons of disposed CO2. According to Statoil\u2019s website, CO2 in the Utsira is safely contained under \u201cgas-tight cap rock and cannot seep into the atmosphere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAlthough the company has rich data about the Utsira formation, less is known about the overlying sedimentary layers. ECO2 researchers have deployed HUGIN and other tools to fill in the details, using an advanced sonar system and a seismic profiler that sent strong acoustic pulses below the sea floor to reveal hidden geological structures.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe data reveal that the upper sedimentary layers hold many natural scars that might serve as conduits for CO2 release from the Utsira. At a site 25 kilometers north of the Sleipner injection well, HUGIN found a 3-kilometer-long fracture that is 10 meters wide in places, and runs 150-200 meters deep. Samples of fluids collected within the fracture suggest that methane and fresh water are leaking out from lower layers, says Karin Landschulze, a graduate student in geophysics at the University of Bergen, Norway.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUnexpected fracture\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBecause the fracture is so far from the injection site, the disposed CO2 is unlikely to reach it any time soon, say ECO2 researchers: since 1996, the CO2 has spread in a plume and now reaches 3 kilometers north of the injection well. But finding such a large and unexpected fracture in the region raises questions, says Wallmann. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it formed, when it formed, and why it formed,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe researchers also discovered smaller vertical features, which they call chimneys and pipes, running through the sedimentary layers. One of these is only about 5 kilometers from the Sleipner CO2 plume, and it reaches all the way down into the Utsira formation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe discovery of so many potential leakage paths in the few sites examined has scientists reconsidering how well-contained the Utsira reservoir really is. \u201cWe might have to appreciate that there is a much greater chance for some CO2 to leak out,\u201d says Stefan Bnz, a marine geologist at the University of Troms in Norway, who participated in the ECO2 experiment.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYet neither the ECO2 project nor Statoil has found any indications that CO2 has leaked from Sleipner in its 17 years of operation. Furthermore, the ECO2 team has tested the likely impact of leaks, should they occur, by injecting up to 150 kilograms of CO2 a day just above the sea floor near Sleipner. They found that the CO2 completely dissolved within the lower few meters of water, rapidly converting to bicarbonate and dispersing. Only a small amount of the injected gas may have reached the atmosphere, says Wallmann.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe researchers also studied a spot in the Mediterranean Sea where natural vents release about 1 tonne of CO2 a day. They found that the gas, which acidifies nearby waters, kills off many organisms within a small, 10-meter zone around the vent and reduces species diversity within a radius of about 100 meters, but that effects beyond that distance are limited.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA leak would be much more troubling from a public-relations standpoint, says Landschulze, because carbon capture and storage has been promoted in Europe as being safe. \u201cIt would be a disaster for public opinion,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYet because offshore disposal happens far from population centres, it has some advantages over onshore storage. Germany, Spain and Norway are each running onshore pilot experiments in which they have injected tens of thousands of tonnes of CO2 into reservoirs underground, but some people have expressed concern about large-scale disposal on land. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to work offshore in the sense that the public perception is not ready for CO2 storage in their backyards,\u201d says hydrogeologist Pascal Audigane of the French Geological Survey in Orlans, who manages a carbon-storage project in an underground lab in Switzerland.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the end, the biggest impediments to sub-seabed CO2 disposal are probably not leakage, but economics. Disposal makes sense at Sleipner, because the CO2 has to be separated from natural gas for commercial purposes anyway, and Norway would impose a tax on Statoil if the waste gas were released. But the price of carbon emissions would have to rise in other countries before it becomes worthwhile to pump waste CO2 from power plants and other sources on land to offshore injection sites. The chances of that happening soon may be slim, but carbon-storage researchers are carrying on with their work in case countries decide to push forward with major cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.\u000a\u000a

VRicha Sharma By\u000a\u000aWith no less than five cyclones having hit the country in 2013, the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has decided to study the reasons behind the surge in the number of cyclonic storms last year, in relation to the previous years.\u000a\u000aIndia was hit by five fierce cyclones, Mahasen, Madi, Helen, Lehar and Phailin, during the last year, compared to two each in 2012 and 2011. The recent cyclones Helen and Lehar, which struck the coasts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu one after another in November 2013, required massive evacuation of the local population and caused extensive damage to public and private properties.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe saw a rather high number of cyclones hitting the country last year and there could be many reasons behind it. We have asked scientists to study, in detail, what led to the increase in cyclone frequency in 2013,\u201d an MoES official said. The MoES has tied up with various educational institutes, including the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhubaneswar, laboratories of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other scientific institutes, to carry out the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Indian Ocean basin has been very active since last year. One reason could be the heating up of the sea due to global warming and it is necessary to understand and analyse it,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aThe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) along with other government agencies carried out one of the biggest evacuations, during cyclone Phailin in October 2013. The timely evacuation of people along the coast limited the number of deaths to around 60. In contrast to 2013, the total number of cyclonic disturbances in 2012 was significantly below normal and only two cyclones hit India.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were no cyclonic disturbances formed over the north of the Indian Ocean and the adjoining land surface during the monsoon (June-September),\u201d the official said.

VWASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a new software that gives anyone the opportunity to know their community, state or country's weather activity for the day and months ahead.Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) designed the software Monitoring Climate Change ( Moclic ) through which it is possible to organise, store and operate geo-referenced data from climate elements.Moclic can calculate bio and agroclimatic indicators, such as humidity, aridity, rain erosion and rainfall concentration, researchers said.The software feeds on data from weather stations in any state or country, unlike current software that use global information, with which what happens in a small ranch regarding temperature can be known more accurately.Francisco Bautista Zuniga, head of Monoclic project, points out that the software allows an agronomist to obtain annual rainfall records and relate them to the crops production figures for explanation of a possible event."Likewise, it is possible to identify desiccation processes in a region, which comes useful when considering the use of improved seeds that can resist droughts, or the optimisation of rainwater catching techniques, storage or types of irrigation," Zuniga said.He said a physician can obtain information about the climatic tendencies of specific periods of time to know the behaviour of intestinal diseases in certain weather conditions.Zuniga pointed out that knowing the tendencies regarding the change of atmospheric conditions is needed by every federal entity, since it can help taking measures prior to a possible flood."The use of Moclic with local data is of great importance because global models do not include land relief nor closeness to sea data, among others."The software is very simple and can be used by decision making characters, as governors, breeders, physicians, farmers, students, or anyone whose repercussions could have economic, politic or social effects," said Zuniga.

VWASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a new software that gives anyone the opportunity to know their community, state or country\u2019s weather activity for the day and months ahead.Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) designed the software Monitoring Climate Change (Moclic) through which it is possible to organize, store and operate geo-referenced data from climate elements.Moclic can calculate bio and agroclimatic indicators, such as humidity, aridity, rain erosion and rainfall concentration, researchers said. The software feeds on data from weather stations in any state or country, unlike current software that use global information, with which what happens in a small ranch regarding temperature can be known more accurately. Francisco Bautista Zuniga, head of Moclic project, said that the software allows an agronomist to obtain rainfall records and relate them to the crops production figures for explanation of a possible event.

VAustralia is exploring the opportunities of exporting SolarGas technology which it feels has potential applications in Indian industry. Some of the sectors identified are petrochemicals, fertilisers and transportation.\u000a\u000aDeveloped by Australian scientists the technology can provide a sustainable and cost effective alternative for the production of hydrogen, which in turn will help these industries, says Jim Hinkley, of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).\u000a\u000aIn India recently, Hinkley told Business Line that, \u201cThere is a particularly strong potential to roll out the technology in Gujarat and Rajasthan because both states have excellent solar resources and natural gas infrastructure, as well as being major industrial users of hydrogen\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe technology facilitates concentrating the sun's rays to drive a reaction between water and natural gas which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds. The resulting fuel has a higher energy yield than natural gas. The SolarGas can then be used to produce high-efficiency electricity in a gas engine or turbine, he explained.\u000a\u000aAccording to CSIRO by using Sun\u2019s rays for heat, in combination with new catalysts, SolarGas uses upto 50 per cent less fossil fuel and higher percentage of water as well.\u000a\u000aA study has also found that the technology developed by the CSIRO could help India\u2019s efforts towards achieving energy security. Some of the benefits include improved energy and food security by reducing natural gas consumption; new jobs created through local manufacturing and operation of the technology; the potential to produce solar liquid fuels for transport.\u000a\u000aThe study was funded by the Australian Government and undertaken by CSIRO in collaboration with the Solar Energy Corporation of India. It has also developed a concept design for a pilot scale SolarGas facility and identified numerous potential host sites suitable for such a pilot project.\u000a\u000aEnergy and energy security are critical issues for Australia and India, and we have much to offer each other by sharing our renewable technology expertise and technology, said Australia\u2019s High Commissioner to India Patrick Suckling while launching the study recently.\u000a\u000asomasekhar.m@thehindu.co.in

VFor decades, Americans have talked about \u201cenergy policy\u201d as if it were the political equivalent of a migraine. The phrase connoted pain \u2014 in ever-rising gas prices, costly government schemes and dependence on imports from precarious Middle East regimes.\u000a\u000aBut recent developments involving energy production and technology have been so astonishing that they should puncture this long-running pessimism. The amazing fact is that on nearly every front, America\u2019s energy prospects have improved in ways that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago.\u000a\u000aIn the energy marketplace, President Obama\u2019s vision of an \u201call of the above\u201d strategy is actually happening. Production of oil, gas and alternative energy is rising, even as demand begins falling for these energy sources \u2014 all thanks to new technology. The market forces driving these changes are so powerful that even politicians probably can\u2019t screw them up. The changes in the energy picture were summarised for me recently by Energy Secretary Ernie Moniz. He\u2019s a former MIT physics professor who, with his curly over-the-collar hair, looks very unlike the usual Cabinet secretary. I\u2019d worry that Moniz was just blowing smoke, but he backed up his claims with extensive statistics.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s start with oil production: According to a new study released this month by the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. is on track to pump nearly 10 million barrels of oil a day by 2016 \u2014 roughly equal to Saudi Arabia\u2019s output.\u000a\u000aThis forecast is much stronger than a year ago, thanks to rapid shale-oil development \u201cas producers locate and target the sweet spots of \u2018plays\u2019 currently under development and find additional tight formations that can be developed with the latest technologies,\u201d notes the EIA report. Oil production from shale reserves is forecast to increase from 2.3 million barrels a day in 2012 (or 35 per cent of U.S. production) to 4.8 million barrels in 2021, (or 51 per cent of the total).\u000a\u000aNext, let\u2019s look at natural gas, where production is expected to surge 56 per cent between 2012 and 2040. Here again, the new factor is shale formations that can be unlocked by hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d of the rocks. This shale gas will soon account for about half of total U.S. gas production. Environmentalists worry that fracking may contaminate ground water. This issue is sharply debated, but what\u2019s indisputable on the environmental front is that the flood of cheap gas is reducing U.S. use of coal \u2014 which, in turn, is sharply lowering emissions here of carbon dioxide, which scientists see as the cause of global climate change. The EIA study predicts U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide will remain below their 2005 level in every year through 2040. This American carbon reduction comes at a time when emissions are rising in Europe, Japan and other developed economies.\u000a\u000aBy substituting lower-carbon fuels for coal, the U.S. has broken the usual link between rising gross domestic product and rising emissions. In America, emissions per dollar of GDP in 2040 are expected to be 56 per cent below their 2005 level, a drop of 2.3 per cent a year. Meanwhile, technologists have found ways to capture carbon dioxide through coal gasification and pump it into depleted oil wells \u2014 allowing recovery of trapped oil. This \u201cenhanced oil recovery\u201d is now adding about 300,000 barrels per day, but some analysts speculate it could rise to as much as 3 million daily barrels in a few years.\u000a\u000aAlternative fuels? Wind farms and solar panels may be a laugh line for conservatives, but they shouldn\u2019t be. Since 2008, wind-power capacity has more than tripled in the U.S., and is now generating the equivalent of about 60 large nuclear reactors. Photovoltaic panels are producing 10 times the power they did in 2008, with the cost down from $3.40 per watt to about 80 cents. It\u2019s an almost ridiculously upbeat story. Thanks to rising domestic production and falling demand, U.S. dependence on foreign energy imports will fall to just 4 per cent in 2040, compared to 30 per cent in 2005. And we haven\u2019t even talked about the strategic implications of this energy independence and reduced vulnerability to Middle East turmoil. It\u2019s hard to give up our view of energy as a national headache, but these startling forecasts suggest the energy future is, dare we say, rather bright. \u2014  2014. The Washington Post\u000a\u000aSince 2008, wind-power capacity has more than tripled and photovoltaic panels are producing 10 times more power

VNEW DELHI: Amid Centre\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase the share of green energy in India\u2019s overall electricity mix, a group of MPs from different political parties requested the government to incentivize states to increase their share of \u2018Renewable Purchase Obligation\u2019 and introduce tax benefit instruments to mobilize low cost funds for the sector.The MPs on Monday also submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , requesting him to bring out a roadmap for gradual replacement of kerosene and LPG with renewable energy for lighting and cooking.They gave their suggestions representing Climate Parliament \u2013 a network of parliamentarians working to promote renewable energy to combat climate change -- which is a forum of legislatures from across the globe to sensitize people and governments about importance of clean electricity like solar power and wind energy.Electricity Act, 2003 mandates State Electricity Regulatory Commissions across the country to set targets -- known as Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) -- for distribution companies to purchase certain percentage of their total power need from renewable energy sources. However, most states \u2013 except for renewable power-rich Gujarat and Rajasthan -- had miserably failed to comply with their targets.Seeking to end such problem, the Climate Parliament has come out with six-point recommendations which the MPs believe will help the government not only achieve its clean energy target under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) but also to promote renewable \u2013 solar and wind -- energy generation in a big way.Under the existing target, India is supposed to increase its share of renewable energy in the total energy mix to the extent of 15% (90,000 mw) by 2020.Referring to the target, the MPs -- including A K Saha of CPM, Shashi Bhusan Behera of BJD, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP, J D Seelam of Congress and Jayant Chaudhary of RLD \u2013 requested the PM "to immediately work towards amending the National Electricity Policy (NEP) in consultation with state governments so that the NAPCC targets are recognized under the Electricity Act, 2003".They also suggested that the funds for kerosene subsidy (Rs 300 billion) must be transferred to ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) for promoting and implementing the replacement scheme of fossil fuels in the long run.In order to mobilize low cost funds for the renewable energy sector, the Climate Parliament recommended adequate budgetary allocation for the MNRE in the coming financial year. The MPs\u2019 letter to PM said, "Lack of funding is leading to delays in more than one government programmes."They also recommended extending tax benefits to the renewable energy lending institutions, proposing green bonds with tax benefits under Section 10 (23G) of the Income Tax Act. "The proceeds from the green bonds should be utilized for primary financing as well as refinancing of existing project loans", the letter said.

VScientists have discovered a new method to convert harmful greenhouse gases into chemicals which can produce synthetic fuels, while reducing industrial carbon dioxide emissions by up to 40 per cent.\u000a\u000aResearchers at the University of Delaware have developed a highly selective catalyst capable of electrochemically converting carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas - to carbon monoxide with 92 per cent efficiency.\u000a\u000aThe resulting carbon monoxide can be used as an industry feedstock for producing synthetic fuels, while reducing industrial carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 40 per cent, researchers said.\u000a\u000a"Converting carbon dioxide to useful chemicals in a selective and efficient way remains a major challenge in renewable and sustainable energy research," according to Feng Jiao, assistant professor of chemical and bio-molecular engineering and the project's lead researcher.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that when they used a nano-porous silver electrocatalyst, it was 3,000 times more active than polycrystalline silver, a catalyst commonly used in converting carbon dioxide to useful chemicals.\u000a\u000aSilver is considered a promising material for a carbon dioxide reduction catalyst because it offers high selectivity - approximately 81 per cent - and because it costs much less than other precious metal catalysts.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, because it is inorganic, silver remains more stable under harsh catalytic environments.\u000a\u000aThe exceptionally high activity is likely due to the new electrocatalyst's extremely large and highly curved internal surface, which is approximately 150 times larger and 20 times intrinsically more active than polycrystalline silver, Feng said.\u000a\u000aFeng said the active sites on the curved internal surface required a much smaller than expected voltage to overcome the activation energy barrier needed to drive the reaction.\u000a\u000aTo validate whether their findings were unique, the researchers compared the nano-porous silver catalyst with other potential carbon dioxide electrocatalysts including polycrystalline silver and other silver nanostructures such as nanoparticles and nanowires.\u000a\u000aTesting under identical conditions confirmed the non-porous silver catalyst's significant advantages over other silver catalysts in water environments.\u000a\u000aReducing greenhouse carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use is considered critical. Over the last 20 years, electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction has attracted attention because of the ability to use electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave.

VNEW DELHI: Delhi Metro's energy efficiency could help it rake in more moolah. On Sunday, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) announced that it had become the first rail system in the world to be awarded Gold Standard Foundation- a globally accepted certification standard for carbon mitigation projects.Now, instead of the 70 cents that Delhi Metro got for every carbon credit, it will be getting between 4-5 Euros."The energy efficiency measures have been undertaken primarily in the heating, venting and airconditioning systems, lighting system and other energy efficient measures of station buildings," said a DMRC official.The Delhi Metro registered for the certification as the energy efficiency measures undertaken by it in 51 stations in Phase II qualified under the criterion verified by the auditors. "All the steps taken during Phase II lead to tremendous amount of energy savings and was more efficient than Phase I. It resulted in reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by at least 25%," it added.Compared to the United Nations rate for one carbon credit (70 cents), the Gold Standard carbon offset carries a price premium (4-5 Euros).In 2008, DMRC was registered by the United Nations under the clean development mechanism which enabled it to earn over Rs 9.5 crore as carbon credits through measures like regenerative braking, wherein the kinetic energy released from the application of brakes is used to accelerate the train.With the Gold Standard registration, DMRC is hoping to earn around 7,500 credits annually for the next ten years."We are also working on other projects to get them registered under the Gold Standard," the official said.

He said the project with a budget of 46,000 crore will get its first allocation by the end of this month.He was inaugurating the fifth international \u2018Casuarina workshop\u2019 at Mamallapuram to tap the potential of casuarina cultivation for environment and livelihood.The mission envisages increasing green cover in the country from 24% to 33% in 10 years. The mission is one of the 10 national missions under the environment ministry to deal with climate change and its impact. Rajagopalan said Green India Mission targets afforestation of 10 million hectares and methods being taken up include agroforestry to ensure livelihood support for local communities.When asked about allegations that the Union ministry has cleared projects worth 1.5lakh crore immediately after the resignation of Jayanthi Natarajan as the environment minister, Rajagopalan said the projects were cleared following procedures. \u201cThey were long pending. There was nothing unusual in that,\u201d he said.The international casuarina workshop is hosted by the Coimbatore-based Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding. Addressing the workshop attended by scientists, farmers and industries, Rajagopalan said the cultivation, harvest, processing and transport of casuarinas generate employment and a stable market in the rural areas.

VChicago: A warmer Arctic could permanently affect the pattern of the high-altitude polar jet stream, resulting in longer and colder winters over North America and northern Europe, US scientists say.\u000a\u000aThe jet stream, a ribbon of high altitude, high-speed wind in northern latitudes that blows from west to east, is formed when the cold Arctic air clashes with warmer air from further south.\u000a\u000aThe greater the difference in temperature, the faster the jet stream moves.\u000a\u000aAccording to Jennifer Francis, a climate expert at Rutgers University, the Arctic air has warmed in recent years as a result of melting polar ice caps, meaning there is now less of a difference in temperatures when it hits air from lower latitudes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe jet stream is a very fast moving river of air over our head,\u201d she said Saturday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cBut over the past two decades the jet stream has weakened. This is something we can measure,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs a result, instead of circling the earth in the far north, the jet stream has begun to meander, like a river heading off course. This has brought chilly Arctic weather further south than normal, and warmer temperatures up north. Perhaps most disturbingly, it remains in place for longer periods of time.\u000a\u000aThe US is currently enduring an especially bitter winter, with the midwestern and southern US states experiencing unusually low temperatures. In contrast, far northern regions like Alaska are going through an unusually warm winter this year.\u000a\u000aThis suggests \u201cthat weather patterns are changing,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe can expect more of the same and we can expect it to happen more frequently.\u201d\u000a\u000aTemperatures in the Arctic have been rising \u201ctwo to three times faster than the rest of the planet,\u201d said James Overland, a weather expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\u000a\u000aFrancis says it is premature to blame humans for these changes.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur data to look at this effect is very short and so it is hard to get very clear signal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as we have more data I do think we will start to see the influence of climate change,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aDire impact on agriculture\u000a\u000aThe meandering jet steam phenomenon, sometimes called \u201cSanta\u2019s Revenge\u201d, remains a controversial idea. \u201cThere is evidence for and against it,\u201d said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snowland Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.\u000a\u000aBut he said rising Arctic temperatures are directly linked to melting ice caps. \u201cThe sea ice cover acts as a lid which separates the ocean from a colder atmosphere,\u201d Serreze told the conference. But if the lid is removed, then warmth contained in the water rises into the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThis warming trend and the shifting jet stream will have a dire impact on agriculture, especially in the farm-rich middle-latitudes in the US.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are going to see changes in patterns of precipitation, of temperatures that might be linked to what is going on in the far north,\u201d said Serreze.\u000a\u000aJerry Hatfield, head of the National Laboratory for Agriculture and Environment in the midwestern state of Iowa, warned that this is not a phenomenon that affects only the US. \u201cLook around the world\u2014we produce the bulk of our crops around this mid-latitude area,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe main impact on agriculture and livestock will not come from small temperature changes, but rather from temperature extremes and the weather patterns that hold them in place for longer periods of time.\u000a\u000aDroughts and freezes are already having \u201ca major impact on animal productivity, it influences meat production, milk and eggs production,\u201d he said.

VNew Delhi: In a setback to the automobile industry, already under pressure because of declining sales, the government has notified mandatory fuel efficiency norms that would push up their production costs.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, the move, once implemented, is likely to reduce the carbon footprint of the automobile industry. It is the first time that such norms have been introduced.\u000a\u000aOf the more than 80 car models plying on Indian roads at present, only around eight comply with these standards.\u000a\u000aUnder the new norms, the industry will have to ensure that the mileage of cars on Indian roads improves by 10% by 2021. The second phase, for which the government did not specify a deadline, will begin from 2022 and targets a fuel efficiency improvement by 30%.\u000a\u000aFailure to comply will invite a penalty. Under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, car makers that fail to meet carbon emission norms will be fined Rs.10 lakh initially and asked to pay a penalty of Rs.10,000 a day till their car models meet the norms, said Ajay Mathur, director general, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE).\u000a\u000aThese norms were finalized by BEE, which functions under India\u2019s power ministry.\u000a\u000aThe move couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the Indian automobile industry, which is struggling with a decline in sales in the face of slowing economic growth and is on course to post its first sales drop in 10 years in the 12 months to 31 March. Higher fuel costs and more expensive loans have deterred car buyers in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy.\u000a\u000aThe move to enforce stringent fuel-efficiency norms is significant in the context of higher oil prices, a weaker rupee and efforts to contain pollution in the country. India imports around 80% of its oil requirement and spent $144.293 billion on oil imports in the last fiscal year.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide emissions by vehicles, after the implementation of the new norms, are projected to come down from 142gm per km in 2010-11 to 129.8gm by 2021-22 and 113gm 2022 onwards. A report by Yale and Columbia universities last month called Delhi the world\u2019s most polluted city. Car penetration levels in India are only 1/15th those of the US.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide emissions by cars is likely to come down by 8.59% by 2021-22 and by 20.42% from 2022 onwards.\u000a\u000aThis would mean that the car makers will have to make further investments in new technologies in order to achieve greater fuel efficiency, which, in turn, will have an impact on their profit margins.\u000a\u000aMint reported in September 2012 that the government\u2019s plan to enforce stricter fuel efficiency norms for cars is likely to increase the cost of cars by at least 15%. The industry lobby Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) could not confirm the expected increase in cost.\u000a\u000aMathur of BEE added that since the norms had been notified, the bureau will now begin work on a star rating system for vehicles.\u000a\u000aAs per the original plan, BEE was to give a one-star rating for the least fuel efficient vehicles and five stars for the most efficient in their respective weight class. Vehicles with a higher star rating are expected to be more expensive. BEE had earlier formulated similar standards and star labels for electrical appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators.\u000a\u000aAccording to data provided by Siam, car makers have sold at least 29 million passenger vehicles in India between 1960 and 2013.\u000a\u000aA power ministry notification dated 30 January said the new norms are applicable on the vehicles \u201cused for the carriage of passengers and their luggage and comprising not more than nine seats including driver\u2019s seat, and of gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3,500kg tested on chassis dynamometer (hereinafter referred to as the said motor vehicle) for the purpose of manufacturing or importing for sale of the said category of motor vehicles\u201d.\u000a\u000aChassis dynamometer is a device that measures the amount of power translated from the wheels to the racing surface. These energy consumption standard are for the motor vehicles using petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG).\u000a\u000aThe government has extended the deadline for implementation of the new norms by a year. Initially, the first phase was to be launched from 2015, and the second from 2020. But a delay in notifying the norms has led to the years being pushed to 2016 and 2022, respectively.\u000a\u000aVishnu Mathur, director general of Siam declined to comment. I.V. Rao, executive adviser at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said car makers need to improve the overall performance of their vehicles.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn order to increase the mileage, the industry needs to reduce the friction, increase combustion or reduce the inertia of the vehicle. Better fuel efficiency could also be achieved reducing the weight and air resistance,\u201d Rao said.\u000a\u000aThe power ministry has derived a formula based on the average fuel consumption standard, where the mileage will be decided on the basis of litres of fuel consumed by a vehicle to run 100km. In the first phase, the government expects the cars to consume 5.49 litres of fuel on average to cover 100km by 2016, thus increasing the average mileage to 18.2km per litre from 16.5km in 2010-11, when the norms were initially proposed.\u000a\u000aIn the second phase, the consumption of fuel will come down to 4.77 litres for 100km, increasing the mileage to 21km per litre.\u000a\u000aSince fuels such as CNG, LPG and diesel offer better mileage for passenger vehicles, the ministry has notified guidelines that make these fuels equivalent to the petrol proportionately. The average vehicle weight for this class of vehicles for the first phase will be 1,037kg, which will be increased to 1,145kg.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the BSE Auto Index of 10 companies was down 0.17% to 11,922.86 points while the benchmark index Sensex was down 1.25% to 20,193.35 points.

VTokyo: Global warming will reduce the world's crop production by up to two percent every decade and wreak $1.45 trillion of economic damage by the end of this century, according to a draft UN report, Japanese media said on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe document is the second volume in a long-awaited trilogy by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a Nobel-winning group of scientists, which is set to be issued next month after a five-day meeting in Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.\u000a\u000aThe trilogy is the IPCC's first great overview of the causes and effects of global warming, and options for dealing with it, since 2007.\u000a\u000aAccording to the draft, if global temperatures rise by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 Fahrenheit), the world's aggregated gross domestic production will fall by 0.2 to 2 percent, the mass circulation said.\u000a\u000aThat would translate into 15 trillion yen to 148 trillion yen ($147 billion to $1.45 trillion) in economic losses, calculated against the world's total GDP in 2012, it said.\u000a\u000aThe planet's crop production will decline by up to two percent every decade as rainfall patterns shift and droughts batter farmland, even as demand for food rises a projected 14 percent, it said.\u000a\u000aOther effects from global warming include the loss of land to rising sea levels, forcing hundreds of millions of people to migrate from coastal areas, with the most vulnerable regions including East, South and Southeast Asia, it said.\u000a\u000aThe draft report, which will be reviewed in the March 25-29 meeting in Yokohama, calls for mitigation measures to reduce the vulnerability of environments to climate change such as flood protection projects and research on the prevention of infectious diseases, it said.\u000a\u000aIn the first volume of the trilogy, the IPCC said it was more certain than ever that humans were the cause of global warming and predicted temperatures would rise another 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (0.5-8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.\u000a\u000aHeatwaves, floods, droughts and rising seas are among the threats that will intensify through warming, it said in in the report released in September in Stockholm.\u000a\u000aUN climate chief Christiana Figueres said the report was "an alarm-clock moment for the world".\u000a\u000a"To steer humanity out of the high danger zone, governments must step up immediate climate action and craft an agreement in 2015" against greenhouse gases, she said at the time.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC has delivered four previous assessments in its 25-year history.\u000a\u000aEach edition has sounded an ever-louder siren to warn that temperatures are rising and the risk to the climate system is accentuating.\u000a\u000aThe projections for this century are based on computer models of trends in heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, especially from coal, oil and gas, which provide the backbone of energy supply today.\u000a\u000aA Japanese environment ministry official declined to comment on the report, citing IPCC's request to keep it behind closed doors until the final version is approved in Yokohama.\u000a\u000aAFP

VThe Australian government's climate change agency warned today that Canberra's five per cent emissions reduction target was "not credible" compared with other countries and called for it to be tripled.\u000a\u000aThe Climate Change Authority (CCA) said risked losing its competitive edge if it did not accelerate emissions reduction strategies.\u000a\u000aInstead of the current commitment to lower greenhouse gas emissions by five percent of 2000 levels by 2020, it said ought to target a minimum reduction of 15 percent.\u000a\u000aDoing so would only slow annual growth in average per person income by 0.02 per cent, the authority said in a new report.\u000a\u000a"The five percent minimum (at) present isn't credible in terms of the task that has to be done and the time frame," said CCA chairman Bernie Fraser, a former Reserve Bank of governor.\u000a\u000aCCA is an independent body set up by the previous Labor government and which the new conservative administration is trying to abolish.\u000a\u000aThe report said Australia's five percent target -- due to be reviewed by the government by April 30 -- was weaker than that of "many other comparable countries".\u000a\u000aIn the United States the target was a 17 percent reduction on 2005 levels by 2020, Britain was aiming for a 34 percent off 1990 levels and Norway was targeting a 30-40 percent decrease from the same period.\u000a\u000aThe world's heaviest emitters, China and the US, were both "stepping up their efforts on climate change", the report added, with initiatives including investment in renewable energy, tightening of vehicle emissions standards and local emissions trading pilot schemes.\u000a\u000a"A target of 15 percent for Australia would be more in line with the targets being pursued by such countries," the report said.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Tony Abbott once described the science behind man-made climate change as "absolute crap" and dismisses any link between global warming and increasing frequency of events such as drought and wildfires.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aSolar energy, in a limited way, has started powering telecom towers, bank branches, data centres and ATMs in power deficient rural India and areas faced with erratic supply of grid power.\u000a\u000aCompanies providing equipment for power back-up and solar power producers have confirmed that this trend is catching up with support from government as well as telecom companies and banks which are opting for clean and uninterrupted energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are providing solar inverters of smaller ratings to ATMs. More than ATMs, our concentration is bank branches. At present, the adoption of solar power in the banking sector is at a nascent stage, but it is aggressively picking up,\u201d Sunil Khanna, President and Managing Director, Emerson Network Power, told The Hindu.\u000a\u000aAsked to quantify the number of ATMs running on solar power, he said: \u201cIt will be difficult to give a number, but one can expect solar power ATMs to populate Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities in the near future. We see great business potential in this sector going ahead. Some of the ATMs that are running are located in the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said in the banking sector there had been a shift from traditional data centres to data centres in a box which were cost-effective solutions and fell in the realm of \u2018plug and play\u2019. In rural areas, solar energy was being preferred to run data centres, he added.\u000a\u000aEmerson Network Power, a part of $24.7 billion American conglomerate Emerson, is into back-up power system, among others.\u000a\u000aMore than banks, telecom companies have adopted solar energy to power telecom towers.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt present, we are powering more than 20 telecom towers and by April1 2014, the number will go up to 40. From one micro solar power plant site, we are powering three towers of different companies,\u201d Sushil Jiwarajka, Chairman, Omnigrid Micropower Co. Pvt. Ltd., told The Hindu. He said his company, a micro power producer, had been setting up solar power plants costing about Rs.75 lakh in inaccessible areas targeting telecom towers as anchor customers.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are providing surplus power to banks, schools, petrol pumps and even households in the locality to make our project viable,\u201d he added. Omnigrid, which has now solar plants in Uttar Pradesh, is gearing up to enter Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, North East, Madhya Pradesh and J&K which face acute power shortage.\u000a\u000aTelecom Regulatory Authority of India\u2019s (TRAI\u2019s) requirement for telecom companies to use renewable sources of energy for powering 50 per cent of their telecom towers in rural areas is helping.

VAstonishingly, it has taken the government close to a decade to sanction funds for the Green India Mission, which was one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has, at long last, approved an outlay of Rs 46,000 crore for this ambitious programme to increase cover by five million hectares and improve the quality of forests on another five million hectares over the next 10 years. However, doubts linger whether the mission can take off in full measure straightaway. For, only part of the funding comes from the Plan outlay; the rest is to be sourced through convergence with other programmes, such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, the Compensatory Afforestation Fund and the ongoing National Afforestation Programme. Even the corporate social responsibility kitty is planned to be tapped for this purpose. Such an arrangement might pose problems in practice. Moreover, it is not envisaged as a wholly centrally funded programme. States are required to chip in with 25 per cent of the required finances (10 per cent in the case of north-eastern states), which may prove a stumbling block given the tight fiscal position of many forest-predominated states.\u000a\u000aIndeed, such laxity in funding this programme reflects not only apathy towards forests but also, perhaps, wavering commitment to combat climate change. Both these are unwelcome developments. India's forests are shrinking in area and deteriorating in quality. Going by the biennial "State of Forests Report 2011" (the 2013 edition is yet to be released), the overall cover declined by 367 square kilometres (sq km) compared to the situation in 2009. The most worrisome finding pertained to the reduction of 548 sq km in the cover of hills - which badly need vegetative protection due to their geological fragility - and of 679 sq km in tribal belts where local communities rely heavily on forests for livelihood. What is also disquieting is that the country is left with only 2.54 per cent of its geographical area under dense forests and another 9.76 per cent under moderately dense foliage. The rest of the forests have varying degrees of density, including some that are only sparsely vegetated.\u000a\u000aThe 22 per cent of the country's area that is occupied by forests contributes less than one per cent to the gross domestic product. Most forest produce-based industries, in sectors such as plywood manufacture, pulp and paper production, herbal pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, are operating at below their rated capacities. The furniture and construction sectors, too, rely partly on imported wood and wooden products. Many of the precious species of flora and fauna have already become extinct or are turning scarce. Some of the world's richest biodiversity hotspots, including the Himalayan region and the Western Ghats, are gravely endangered. To reverse these trends, the needs to conceive strategies that can ensure inter-ministerial cooperation and do not clash with either the forest-dwelling population or the plethora of existing forest-related laws, including the Forest Rights Act. This essential task has been left rather late.

VGovt not supporting eco-friendly measure that can earn money\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) is yet to start carbon auditing for the MG Road-Baiyappanahalli stretch on which commercial operations began more than two years ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe delay, claim officials concerned, is due to huge expenditure involved in auditing, falling carbon price in the international market and lack of government support.The Delhi Metro has, however, already started carbon crediting. Also, it has made advance sales of 41,000 tonnes of carbon credit from 2007-17 to Japan under the first project and is even chalking out modalities for the second project.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCarbon crediting is a \u2018clean development mechanism\u2019 that is adopted by developing countries. As per an agreement signed under the United Nations Framework for Climate Change, nations are paid to adopt green projects and carbon is \u2018traded\u2019 as an immediate answer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is calculated through two mechanisms: One, where energy is \u2018converted\u2019 into carbon and collected and sold in the international market for a price. Another is where mass transport companies calculate the amount of fuel saved by getting people to shift from personalised transport to public transport.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aU A Vasanth Rao, general manager (finance), BMRCL, told Deccan Herald that the Namma Metro project was envisaged as a mechanism for carbon crediting, when the project was being operationalised. BMRCL, however, is yet to appoint an agency for the auditing, to find out how much carbon credit it can get and how much it will benefit the company.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRao pointed out that auditing through a private agency was very expensive. Past interactions with private organisations have been futile. BMRCL has realised that investment is high, but returns are minimum. Apart from clean emissions, the aim of carbon trading is to make money, which can be utilised for infrastructural works, he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aProf N H Ravindranath from the Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc, however, opined that Namma Metro was an ongoing project and does not qualify for carbon trading now. Carbon trading can be done for additional climate change-related activities of an existing dedicated project, like BMTC and KSRTC shifting to use of biofuels or alternative fuels.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe BBMP too can go for carbon crediting, if it effectively implements its waste treatment programmes. Bescom also can harness solar energy to help reduce emissions. For BMRCL, however, the current fuel emission rate per passenger per vehicle is low.Ravindranath said that if BMRCL wants to trade carbon, it will have to wait longer as the price of carbon too has dropped in international market. Four years ago, the rate was about $ 50 per tonne, while now it is merely 70 cents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExperts in the Centre for Science and Environment, who oppose carbon crediting, say that it is a method merely to make both developing nations and major projects pay for development, while the developed nations do nothing. They added, however, that changing from private to public transport is the need of the hour and it is such projects that the government should support.

VPTI By\u000a\u000aThe last edge of the Greenland ice sheet that had resisted global warming has now become unstable, adding billions of tonnes of meltwater to rising seas, scientists said today.\u000a\u000aIn a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, they said a surge in temperature from 2003 had eased the brakes on a long "river" of ice that flows to the coast in northeastern Greenland.\u000a\u000aKnown as an ice stream, the "river" takes ice from a vast basin and slowly shifts it to the sea -- in the same way that the Amazon River drains water.\u000a\u000aIn the past, the flow from this ice stream had been constrained by massive buildups of ice debris choking its mouth.\u000a\u000aBut a three-year spell of exceptionally high temperatures removed this blockage -- and like a cork removed from a bottle helped accelerate the flow, the study said.\u000a\u000aThe ice stream, called Zachariae, is the largest drain from an ice basin that covers a whopping 16 per cent of the Greenland ice sheet.\u000a\u000aFrom 2003 to 2012, northeastern Greenland disgorged 10 billion tonnes of ice annually into the ocean, the study found.\u000a\u000a"Northeast Greenland is very cold. It used to be considered the last stable part of the Greenland ice sheet," said Michael Bevis, an Earth sciences professor at Ohio State University, who led the study.\u000a\u000a"This study shows that ice loss in the northeast is now accelerating. So, now it seems that all the margins of the Greenland ice sheet are unstable."\u000a\u000aGreenland is estimated to contribute 0.012 inches to the 0.13 inches annual rise in global sea levels.\u000a\u000aThe main tool in the study was data from a network of 50 Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors along the Greenland coast.\u000a\u000aThe monitors use Earth's natural elasticity as a stethoscope of the ice sheet. Ice is heavy, so when it melts in massive quantities the land rebounds and the position of the sensors changes slightly.

Hundreds of companies are likely to join them in the next few years.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGodrej & Boyce, Infosys, ITC, Tata Chemicals, NTPC, GAIL, Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), Jet Airways, Ambuja Cement, Yes Bank and Ford Motors are few of the companies that are part of the India Greenhouse Gas Programme.\u000a\u000aIndia made this commitment in 2009 by a declaration in Parliament by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh.\u000a\u000a"There are about 100 companies getting their carbon emission measured on a voluntary basis today. Our target is to get at least a 1,000 companies in the next three years," Jamshyd N Godrej, chairman of Godrej & Boyce, one of the industry leaders who spearhead this initiative, told HT.\u000a\u000aCompanies use Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and tools developed by World Resources Institute (WRI), a global research organisation, to measure and manage their carbon footprint. "Measuring of emission in our production and supply chain systems are important to bring it down significantly over time," said Godrej.\u000a\u000a"At some stage the international agreement on carbon reduction will come into force. And then the government will make mandatory emission cuts and existing emission norms will become tighter," he said. "It is very much in the interest of companies that you reduce carbon emission. You save money by using less energy," he added.\u000a\u000aGodrej said the initiatives have started to bear fruit as consumer goods major ITC, one of the pioneers, has emerged the only company in the world carbon, water and recycling solid waste positive.\u000a\u000aThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency has initiated a scheme for 500 units in the energy-intensive sectors such as oil and gas, power, steel and cement to trade benefits of carbon reduction among themselves. "It will take some time to gain traction, but will help bring down average carbon emission," said Godrej.

VDesert dust from North Africa and the Arabian peninsula stimulates monsoon rains over India, said a study today suggesting that desertification from global warming may boost these seasonal downpours.\u000a\u000aAnalysis of satellite data showed that dusty conditions in North Africa and West Asia were followed within days by stronger monsoon rains in the subcontinent, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience.\u000a\u000a\u201cDust in the air absorbs sunlight west of India, warming the air and strengthening the winds carrying moisture eastward,\u201d the US-based Pacific Northwest National Laboratory said in a press release.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis results in more monsoon rainfall about a week later in India.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndians have long known that heavy dust brought by strong winds occurs frequently just before monsoon rains, but no scientific link has previously been drawn.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe study... shows that natural airborne particles can influence rainfall in unexpected ways, with changes in one location rapidly affecting weather thousands of miles away,\u201d said the statement.\u000a\u000aCommenting on the findings, William Lau of NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division said the reported effect could become more pronounced with climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe expected expansion of desert and arid regions under global warming could enhance dust transport from the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa to the Asian monsoon regions, further enhancing monsoon rainfall,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe researchers stressed that dust was not the only phenomenon to affect monsoons.\u000a\u000aOthers factors include temperature differences between land and ocean, changes in land use, global warming and local effects of pollution heating or cooling air and affecting clouds.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe strength of monsoons has been declining for the last 50 years,\u201d said study co-author Phil Rasch.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dust effect is unlikely to explain the systematic decline, but it may contribute.\u201d

VIn an authoritative report due out tomorrow a United Nations climate panel for the first time is connecting hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers. Top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees.\u000a\u000aThey're not saying it will cause violence, but will be an added factor making things even more dangerous. Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world a bit more, says the report by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The summary of the report is being finalised this weekend by the panel in Yokohama.\u000a\u000aThat's a big change from seven years ago, the last time the IPCC addressed how warming affected Earth, said report lead author Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution of Science in California. The summary that political leaders read in early 2007 didn't mention security issues will, he said, because of advances in research.\u000a\u000a"There's enough smoke there that we really need to pay attention to this," said Ohio University security and environment professor Geoff Dabelko, one of the lead authors of the report's chapter on security and climate change.\u000a\u000aFor the past seven years, research in social science has found more links between climate and conflict, study authors say, with the full report referencing hundreds of studies on climate change and conflict.\u000a\u000aThe US Defense Department earlier this month in its once-every-four-years strategic review, called climate change a "threat multiplier" to go with poverty, political instability and social tensions worldwide. Warming will trigger new problems but also provide countries new opportunities for resources and shipping routes in places such as the melting Arctic, the Pentagon report says.\u000a\u000aAfter the climate panel's 2007 report, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wrote that along with other causes, the conflict in the Darfur region of western Sudan "began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change. "\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile the IPCC report this year downplays global warming's role in that particular strife, saying other issues were far more influential, the report's drafts do add that there is "justifiable common concern" that climate change increases the risk of fighting in similar circumstances.\u000a\u000a"Climate change will not directly cause conflict, but it will exacerbate issues of poor governance, resource inequality and social unrest," retired US Navy Adm David Titley, now a Pennsylvania State University professor of meteorology, wrote in an email.\u000a\u000a"The Arab Spring and Syria are two recent examples." But Titley, who wasn't part of the IPCC report, says "if you are already living in a place affected by violent conflict, I suspect climate change becomes the least of your worries.

VIf the world doesn't cut pollution of heat-trapping gases, the already noticeable harms of global warming could spiral "out of control," the head of a United Nations scientific panel warned today.\u000a\u000aAnd he's not alone. The Obama says it is taking this new report as a call for action, with Secretary of State John Kerry saying "the costs of inaction are catastrophic."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that issued the 32-volume, 2,610-page report here early Monday, told The Associated Press: "It is a call for action." Without reductions in emissions, he said, impacts from warming "could get out of control."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOne of the study's authors, Maarten van Aalst, a top official at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said, "If we don't reduce greenhouse gases soon, risks will get out of hand. And the risks have already risen."Twenty-first century disasters such as killer heat waves in Europe, wildfires in the United States, droughts in Australia and deadly flooding in Mozambique, Thailand and Pakistan highlight how vulnerable humanity is to extreme weather, according to the report from the Nobel Prize-winning group of scientists.\u000a\u000aThe dangers are going to worsen as the climate changes even more, the report's authors said.\u000a\u000a"We're now in an era where climate change isn't some kind of future hypothetical," said the overall lead author of the report, Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. "We live in an area where impacts from climate change are already widespread and consequential."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNobody is immune, Pachauri and other scientists said.\u000a\u000a"We're all sitting ducks," Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer, one of the main authors of the report, said in an interview.\u000a\u000aAfter several days of late-night wrangling, more than 100 governments unanimously approved the scientist-written 49-page summary which is aimed at world political leaders. The summary mentions the word "risk" about 5 1/2 times per page.\u000a\u000a"Changes are occurring rapidly and they are sort of building up that risk," Field said.\u000a\u000aThese risks are both big and small, according to the report. They are now and in the future. They hit farmers and big cities. Some places will have too much water, some not enough, including drinking water.\u000a\u000aOther risks mentioned in the report involve the price and availability of food, and to a lesser and more qualified extent some diseases, financial costs and even world peace.

VNEW DELHI: A UN panel on Monday morning released its much awaited report which assessed impacts of climate change on human lives , natural resources and marine ecosystem across the globe. It predicted a gloomy picture for Asia where most of the countries, including India and China, will not only have to face more extreme weather events but also have to experience severe stress on drinking water and food-grains by middle of this century.It more specifically predicted that both India and China will have to see "negative impacts on aggregate wheat yields", impacting the overall food security in the continent.The 49-page report \u2014 summary for policy-makers \u2014 explained in detail how the global warming would affect most of the countries across the globe where poor, who live at the margin of the societies, will have to suffer the most due to pressure on available natural resources.For Asia, this report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC ) \u2014 released in Yokohama, Japan \u2014 said that the impact would increase "risk of drought-related water and food shortage causing malnutrition".It also predicted increased "riverine, coastal, and urban flooding leading to widespread damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and settlements, in Asia". This prediction may well see the impacts of sea-level rise on cities like Mumbai and Kolkata in India and Dhaka in Bangladesh.Some key predictions for Asia include "Increased risk of heat-related mortality, permafrost degradation in Siberia, Central Asia and Tibetan Plateau, shrinking mountain glaciers across most of Asia, changed water availability in many Chinese rivers and increased flow in four rivers due to shrinking glaciers in the Himalayas"."Negative impacts on aggregate wheat yields in South Asia (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), negative impacts on aggregate wheat and maize yields in China and increase in water-borne disease in Israel" are some other predictions of the IPCC.The report said\u2014 "the effects of climate change are already occurring on all continents and across the oceans. The world, in many cases, is ill-prepared for risks from a changing climate".It, however, concluded that there are opportunities to respond to such risks, though the risks "will be difficult" to manage with high levels of warming.The report, titled Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, from Working Group II of the IPCC, detailed the impacts of climate change to date, the future risks from a changing climate, and the opportunities for effective action to reduce risks.A total of 309 coordinating lead authors, lead authors, and review editors, drawn from 70 countries, were selected to produce the report. They enlisted the help of 436 contributing authors, and a total of 1,729 expert and government reviewers from different countries including India.The report identified vulnerable people, industries, and ecosystems around the world. It found that risk from a changing climate comes from vulnerability (lack of preparedness) and exposure (people or assets in harm\u2019s way) overlapping with hazards (triggering climate events or trends). Each of these three components can be a target for smart actions to decrease risk.Releasing the report, Chris Field , Co-Chair of Working Group II said, \u201cThe report concludes that people, societies, and ecosystems are vulnerable around the world, but with different vulnerability in different places. Climate change often interacts with other stresses to increase risk".The Working Group I report was released in September 2013, and the Working Group III report will be released in April 2014. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) cycle will conclude with the publication of its Synthesis Report in October 2014.R K Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, said: \u201cThe Working Group II report is another important step forward in our understanding of how to reduce and manage the risks of climate change. Along with the reports from Working Group I and Working Group III, it provides a conceptual map of not only the essential features of the climate challenge but the options for solutions.\u201d* In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality* Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change, affecting run-off and water resources downstream* Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions* Many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change* Based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts* Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate. Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally* Climate-related hazards affect poor people\u2019s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields, or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity* Freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The fraction of global population experiencing water scarcity and the fraction affected by major river floods increase with the level of warming in the 21st century* Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying competition for water among sectors* Due to sea-level rise projected throughout the 21st century and beyond, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion* Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that, in some cases, could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of GDP* Due to projected climate change by the mid 21st century and beyond, global marine-species redistribution and marine-biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services* Spatial shifts of marine species due to projected warming will cause high-latitude invasions and high local-extinction rates in the tropics and semi-enclosed seas* Species richness and fisheries catch potential are projected to increase, on average, at mid and high latitudes and decrease at tropical latitudes* Climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist* Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change* For the major crops (wheat, rice, and maize) in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2C or more above late-20th-century level

VNEW DELHI: A day after a UN panel predicted gloomy future for South Asia where climate change may even push nations to war due to pressure on natural resources, its chairman R K Pachauri on Tuesday admitted that the situation is indeed bad and it would be worse if the countries do not act together to face this common challenge."The world has all kinds of drivers of stress and drivers of conflict. With the climate change, these are likely to get accentuated further," said Pachauri in an interview to TOI.Pachauri \u2013 chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which released its report in Yokohama, Japan on Monday \u2013 was responding to the kind of messages one can get from this much-awaited document.Asked how this problem could be tacked unless countries in South Asia join hands, he said, "Under SAARC, for instance, we have a programme to deal with environmental protection and climate change. But I am afraid that is not being implemented effectively."Pachauri gave an example of massive floods in Pakistan in 2009 which he could see himself while flying over the country. He had later conveyed his concerns to then Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, when he met him."I later went to meet the then President Zardari and told him that there is no political conflict on these issues and that the two countries should work together because all we are vulnerable. So, it would make a lot of sense that countries of South Asia should coordinate their policies and action to fight the common threat," he said.Asked about Zardari's response, Pachauri \u2013 who is also a member of the Prime Minister's advisory council on climate change in India \u2013 said, "The response was positive. But, it's a question of who's going to bell the cat."His remark assumes significance in view of the predictions made by the IPCC not only for the Asia but the also for whole world where the threat of climate change must be handled through joint action.Referring to the report, even UN climate change secretariat in Bonn had on Monday highlighted those points. In a statement, it said, "The IPCC report makes clear that people around the world are already suffering from climate change, as it directly affects their livelihoods, reducing crops, destroying homes and raising food prices, and that this will accelerate if climate change is left unchecked. It provides a detailed assessment of regional aspects, which give a much clearer understanding of climate impacts in different regions."Touching the human conflict aspects, the secretariat said, "Among other things, the report warns that climate change increases the risk of armed conflict around the world because it worsens poverty and economic shocks. Therefore, climate change is already becoming a determining factor in the national security policies of states."

So, it would make a lot of sense that countries of South Asia should coordinate their policies and action to fight the common threat," he said.Asked about Zardari's response, Pachauri \u2013 who is also a member of the Prime Minister's advisory council on climate change in India \u2013 said, "The response was positive. But, it's a question of who's going to bell the cat."His remark assumes significance in view of the predictions made by the IPCC not only for the Asia but the also for whole world where the threat of climate change must be handled through joint action.Referring to the report, even UN climate change secretariat in Bonn had on Monday highlighted those points. In a statement, it said, "The IPCC report makes clear that people around the world are already suffering from climate change, as it directly affects their livelihoods, reducing crops, destroying homes and raising food prices, and that this will accelerate if climate change is left unchecked. It provides a detailed assessment of regional aspects, which give a much clearer understanding of climate impacts in different regions."Touching the human conflict aspects, the secretariat said, "Among other things, the report warns that climate change increases the risk of armed conflict around the world because it worsens poverty and economic shocks. Therefore, climate change is already becoming a determining factor in the national security policies of states."

VChallenges such as extreme weather, rising seas and worsening scarcity of drinking water are forcing many Asian governments to confront the changes being wrought by a warming planet even as some point to rich Western nations as major culprits.\u000a\u000aMillions of people in the region have already been displaced by floods and droughts thought related to global warming, a United Nations scientific panel said in a report meant to guide policymakers and form the foundation for a new climate treaty due next year.\u000a\u000aExperts say and the South Pacific, home to 4.3 billion people or 60 per cent of all humankind, faces rising risks from climate change that threaten food security, public health and social order.\u000a\u000aScientists who back the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say there is overwhelming evidence that carbon emissions from industrialization and energy-intensive modern lifestyles have driven an increase in the world's average temperature over the past century.\u000a\u000aFailed global efforts to significantly reduce emissions means that nations are now focusing efforts on adapting to a hotter earth.\u000a\u000aJust as colonialism determined much of Asia's past, adapting to profound disruptions from climate change will determine the region's future, said Rajendra Kuma Pachauri, a co-chairman of the climate panel who has spent the past 26 years working on the issue.\u000a\u000a"We have no choice but to start mitigating for climate change today," he said.\u000a\u000aAsia's growing economic importance and rapidly urbanizing populations will give it a pivotal role in humanity's handling of climate change, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University in Bangladesh.\u000a\u000a"It's where the population is, it's where the young population is, it's where the growth dynamism will occur in the next few decades," Huq said after the IPCC met in Yokohama to endorse a summary of a 32-volume report.\u000a\u000aThe climate report outlines in unprecedented detail the regional-level threat of conflicts, food shortages, rising deaths from diseases spread through contaminated water and mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue and malaria. In a region where memories of past famines remain fresh, floods and droughts will likely worsen poverty while pushing food prices and other costs higher, the report said.\u000a\u000a"There are so many Asian countries that are among the most vulnerable. We've seen so many extreme events hit in recent years," said Kelly Levin, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute.\u000a\u000aIndia, the fourth biggest energy consumer and third-largest emitter of carbon, has begun to increase use of renewable energy, doubling its solar generation capacity in 2013, albeit from a modest level, and aiming to generate 15 per cent of its power through renewable energy by 2020.

VNEW DELHI: Environmentalists have been warning about growing encroachments on the Yamuna floodplains being a recipe for disaster . Now, the latest UN panel report on climate change echoes these fears, putting Delhi among three of world\u2019s mega cities that are at high risk of floods The other two cities facing similar risk are Tokyo and Shanghai, says the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change\u2019s report \u2014 Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability \u2014 released on Monday. It says river floodplains need to be secured to be able to adapt to extreme weather and recommends setting aside buffer zones along rivers instead of \u201chard defenses\u201d like channelization or dams.Mumbai and Kolkata also figure in the top Asian cities vulnerable to coastal flooding by 2070s, along with Dhaka, Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Bangkok, Rangoon, and Hai Phng.The report also talks about Delhi\u2019s past-paced growth impacting the micro-climate of the city. It cites the example of Palam, where a rise of more than 1 degree in annual mean minimum temperature has been recorded.Delhi\u2019s environmental problems have found mention for the first time in any report of the UN\u2019s IPCC . The latest one talks about the city\u2019s vulnerability to flooding. Environmentalists have been raising alarm about rampant land-use change of Yamuna floodplains in Delhi. The flow in the river is also highly restricted as most of the water is channelized for irrigation and drinking water purposes before it enters Delhi.\u201cAs per our estimates, 30% of the existing floodplains \u2014 Palla to Jaitpur \u2014 have already been converted. A few instances of conversion, such as the DTC millennium bus depot, can still be reversed. But the rest like Akshardham, Batla house, Metro stations and others are pretty much permanent. We had conducted a detailed study on the floodplains from Wazirabad to Okhla which had large encroachments,\u201d said Manoj Misra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.The IPCC report also focuses on climate change impacts on urban areas and how extremely dense city areas have a significant impact on micro climate through the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The report quotes a study by IIT Delhi which found that the annual mean minimum temperature at Palam weather station had increased considerably since the 1970s and is now comparable to temperatures at Safdarjung weather station.\u201cPalam used to be a deserted area compared to Safdarjung in 1968. We started measuring the difference between the annual mean minimum temperature at Palam and Safdarjung to understand how urbanization affects temperature change. By 80s, there was no difference in the annual mean minimum temperature difference between two locations and in the 2000s Palam often records a higher annual mean minimum. This is because of urbanization. It is the urban heat island phenomenon but in more magnified proportions,\u201d said Manju Mohan, IIT professor and author of the study quoted in the IPCC report.There has been a rise of more than 1 degree in the annual mean minimum temperature in Palam, according to her study.The IPCC report states that climate change will modify the UHI effect in cities. \u201cIncreased frequency of hot days and warm spells will exacerbate urban heat island effects, causing heat-related health problems and, possibly, increased air pollution, as well as an increase in energy demand for warm season cooling Conversely, widespread reduction in periods of very cold weather will mean a decline in heating demands and potential reduction in mortality from cold waves,\u201d the report says.

VThe latest report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on (IPCC) sounds more alarming than its earlier versions - and for good reasons. Even as has begun to hit life, property, infrastructure and the economy, there seems little let-up in environmentally harmful activities. Going by the report, which was released in Japan on Monday, a rise of two degrees Celsius in global could knock 0.2 to 2.0 per cent off the world's gross domestic product (GDP) annually. Worse, it might vitiate the global security environment, thereby leading to more international conflicts over resources such as water and energy and issues related to - and emanating from - loss in agricultural and industrial production, price spikes, and food and livelihood security of the poor. Even more staggering is the estimated need for annual investment of around $147 billion in low-carbon energy till 2029 to ensure a safe, livable climate in the future. This seems a daunting task, given that governments' commitment to combating has tended to wane across the globe in the wake of the economic slowdown.\u000a\u000aIndia is among the most vulnerable countries. It could lose 1.7 per cent of its even if the annual mean rises by just a degree. The loss to its agriculture is valued at as much as $7 billion by 2030, which would affect the incomes of 10 per cent of India's population. The most worrisome in this context are the projected losses in crop output in the country's belt, which would affect at least 200 million people who rely chiefly on farm harvests for their livelihood. Even the livestock sector is unlikely to remain unscathed; its output and product quality have been predicted to deteriorate drastically. The global warming, moreover, is expected to threaten human habitations and natural biodiversity in coastal belts, including coastal towns such as Mumbai and Kolkata. Equally scary is the IPCC's prognosis that extreme weather events, such as last year's in Uttarakhand and cyclone in Odisha, are likely to turn more frequent if the present trends in remain unchanged.\u000a\u000aThe only silver lining is that the projected damages can be slashed by as much as 80 per cent if timely and effective climate resilience measures are taken. There isn't much hope on that count so far. Though New Delhi has put together a well-conceived National Action Plan on Climate Change, the plan has failed to take off except in bits and pieces. Many of the eight "national missions" envisaged to be launched under this plan have remained non-starters. These were slated to deliver measurable results by 2017 in critical areas, such as restricting emissions, increasing green energy use, enhancing power production and consumption efficiency, and extending the country's green cover to 33 per cent of its total geographical area. Meanwhile, other damage mitigation measures brook no further delay. These include refinements in the weather-forecasting and disaster-forewarning systems, which, admittedly, have seen some improvements of late. Besides, the disaster management machinery needs to be revamped and expanded.

VBut aggressive efforts to tackle climate change have repeatedly collided with political reality in Washington, where some Republicans question the underlying science of global warming and lawmakers\u2019 ties to the fossil fuel industry have made them resistant to change.\u000a\u000aThe rise of the Tea Party in recent years has also made a tax increase unlikely.\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s report makes clear, however, that the window is rapidly narrowing to forge new policies that will protect the globe from a future of serious food and water shortages, a drastic sea level rise, increased poverty and disease and other profound risks.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat would be required is a nationwide carbon pricing policy,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of Harvard\u2019s environmental economics programem and a lead author of the report.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that would not be possible without action from Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aDemocrats have twice pushed serious bills to force greenhouse gas polluters like coal-fired power plants and oil refiners to pay to pollute.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBoth of those bills \u2014 one by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and one by President Obama in 2010 \u2014 ultimately failed, contributing to heavy Democratic losses in midterm elections.\u000a\u000aLawmakers who back such efforts, which represent a threat to the bottom lines of the fossil fuel industry, particularly coal, the nation\u2019s top source of carbon pollution, have been criticised by campaigns from Republicans, Tea Party-\u000a\u000aMany members of the Republican Party question the established science that carbon pollution contributes to climate change \u2014 and hundreds have also signed on to a pledge promising never to raise taxes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut there has not been a huge public outcry to endorse new climate change policy. Polls consistently show that while a majority of Americans accept that climate change is real, addressing it ranks at the bottom of voters\u2019 priorities.\u000a\u000aIn the absence of action from Congress, Obama has taken controversial measures to counter climate change; he has already used his executive authority under the Clean Air Act to create Environmental Protection Agency regulations that will slash greenhouse gas pollution from cars and coal-fired power plants.\u000a\u000aDuring this year\u2019s midterm election campaigns, Republicans have used carbon-control policies as a political weapon, calling Obama\u2019s EPA rules a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who is running for re-election in the coal-heavy state of Kentucky, has vowed to use every legislative tactic available to block, repeal or delay those rules if Republicans win control of the Senate this fall.\u000a\u000aWithin that context, many in the Republican establishment think that talking about climate change \u2014 and, particularly, any policy endorsing a tax on fossil fuels \u2014 would be political suicide for a Republican seeking to win the party\u2019s nomination in 2016.\u000a\u000aCrucial climate policies\u000a\u000aThe United Nations report says that if the world\u2019s major economies do not enact steep, fast climate policies well before 2030, in order to cut total global emissions 40 to 70 per cent by 2050, the prospects of avoiding a global atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point past which scientists say the planet will be locked into a dangerous future, will be far more difficult and expensive.\u000a\u000aTen countries are responsible for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s total greenhouse gas pollution. While the report makes clear that all major economies must act, the actions of China and the United States, the top two carbon polluters, will be most crucial.\u000a\u000aThe authors of the report say Obama\u2019s EPA regulations represent a significant first step to cutting United States carbon pollution \u2014 but not enough to avert the worst effects of a warming world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe next president will have to both carry out Obama\u2019s climate change rules and quickly push through even more stringent pollution-cutting policies, according to the report\u2019s authors.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to increase the slope and the pace of the change,\u201d said David Victor, one of the report\u2019s authors and an expert on climate and energy policy at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cAccelerating what we\u2019re doing in the US will be very important for the next administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite the history of roadblocks to enacting climate change policy, some experts say they do see some potential for a legislative path to cut United States carbon pollution.\u000a\u000aOne window could open if Congress takes up a comprehensive effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s corporate tax code, which could happen after the 2016 presidential election.\u000a\u000aLawmakers from both parties have pushed tax reform \u2014 and in that context, there could be room for a grand bargain incorporating new carbon tax, which Democrats want, paired with a cut in corporate or income taxes, which Republicans want.\u000a\u000aProminent conservative economists, like Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and Gregory Mankiw, who advised Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 bid, have endorsed that proposal.\u000a\u000aExperts also note that a shift at the national level could come as more states enact climate change policies. Currently California and several Northeastern states, including New York, have enacted state-level programmes to force carbon polluters to pay to pollute.\u000a\u000aHistorically, California\u2019s environmental laws have served as a vanguard and model for national environmental policy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe push for state-level policies could rise, say experts, if there is a significant increase in extreme weather like droughts and flooding, which contribute to higher adaptation costs for state and local governments.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe question is whether state and local entities want to see action \u2014 and if that can then be translated to local action,\u201d said Thomas Peterson, founder of the Centre for Climate Strategies, a nonprofit group that works on climate policy with state governments.\u000a\u000aThis week\u2019s report said the impact of climate change was already being experienced, and it followed on earlier scientific reports that have noted that climate change was exacerbating drought in Texas, rapidly rising sea levels along the Atlantic coast and higher storm surges caused by hurricanes in states like Florida and Louisiana.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the likely Republican contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination are Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\u000a\u000aOf courses, some of those contenders, like Cruz, Jindal and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, also hail from states where fossil fuel development is a key part of the economy \u2014 and have thus led the way in fighting carbon control policies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe United States needs to enact a major climate change law, such as a tax on carbon pollution, by the end of this decade to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, according to the authors of a report released this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

VIn the 2050s, the increase in the mean sea level along the Mumbai coast may be around 2 cm and it would increase to around 4 cm by 2100.\u000a\u000aThe mean sea level along Mumbai\u2019s coast is likely to rise by around 4 cm while warmer nights, increased rainfall, decline in crop productivity and health issues stare Maharashtra in the next 100 years, finds a study on \u201cAssessing climate change vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies for Maharashtra\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe study was conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), an environmental research institute, in partnership with Met Office Hadley Centre, United Kingdom\u2019s climate change research centre for the state environment department.\u000a\u000aCoastal flooding, the report warned, could lead to reduction in availability of fresh water due to saltwater intrusion as well as contamination of water supply through pollutants from submerged waste dumps. The temperature in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra is likely to increase by 1 to 3 degrees in the next 50 years, and evening or nights would be warmer by 1.5 to 2 degrees.\u000a\u000aThe study is part of the state environment department\u2019s project to study impact of climate change in Maharashtra and devise district-wise plans. \u201cIt is important for the state to develop its own strategy and be prepared to meet challenges posed by climate change,\u201d said R A Rajeev, principal secretary, environment department. \u201cTERI has submitted a draft report and we had some queries so they are finalizing the report.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the 2030s , TERI has predicted that the state\u2019s coastal regions, which include Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane and eastern Maharashtra, will have higher ambient temperature compared to central Maharashtra.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the rainfall increases as predicted, combined with an increase in sea levels, construction close to the sea could be affected because of heavy flooding, which is a grave situation for a coastal city like Mumbai,\u201d said Subimal Ghosh, an associate professor in IIT-B\u2019s civil engineering department and researcher on climate change. \u201cWe need to conserve our water resources and come up with better alerting systems during extreme climate events in Mumbai.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the 2050s, the increase in the mean sea level along the Mumbai coast may be around 2 cm and it would increase to around 4 cm by 2100, according to the executive summary report of the study. Due to increasing temperature and rainfall, coastal and eastern Maharashtra are vulnerable to malaria outbreaks in the future, predicts the study. Even rainfall shows an increasing trend with TERI\u2019s prediction of a 20-40 per cent increase in rainfall through the state.\u000a\u000aHowever, the mean temperature in the state has risen only between 0.5 to 2 degrees and rainfall showed a significant increase only in the Konkan region in the past 100 years, according to A K Srivastava, director of National Climate Centre, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune.\u000a\u000aAcross Maharashtra, Nandurbar was found to be the district that would be the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dhule and Buldhana, while Satara followed by Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg would be the least vulnerable districts.\u000a\u000aanjali.lukose@expressindia.com\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App

VLONDON: An EU-funded research project called Solar Jet has produced the world\u2019s first \u2018solar\u2019 jet fuel from water and carbon dioxide. Researchers have successfully demonstrated the entire production chain for renewable kerosene using concentrated light as a hightemperature energy source.The project is still at an experimental stage and just a glassful of jet fuel was produced in lab conditions using simulated sunlight.The four-year Solar-Jet project was launched in June 2011 and is receiving \u20ac2.2 million EU funding from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.In the next phase of the project, the partners plan to optimize the solar reactor and assess whether the technology will work on a larger scale and at competitive cost. Finding new, sustainable sources of energy will remain a priority under Horizon 2020, the seven-year EU research and innovation programme launched on Jan 1, 2014.European commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Maire Geoghegan-Quinn said, \u201cThis technology means we might one day produce cleaner and plentiful fuel for planes, cars and other forms of transport. This could greatly increase energy security and turn one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming into a useful resource."Concentrated light\u2014 simulating sunlight \u2014was used to convert carbon dioxide and water to synthesis gas (syngas ) in a high-temperature solar reactor containing metaloxide based materials developed at ETH Zrich . The syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) was then converted into kerosene by Shell.Although producing syngas through concentrated solar radiation is still at an early stage of development, the processing of syngas to kerosene is being deployed by companies including Shell on a global scale. Combining the two approaches has the potential to provide secure, sustainable and scalable supplies of aviation fuel as well as diesel and gasoline, or even plastics.

VNEW DELHI: State-run oil biggies are to tap solar power to light up the lives of one million school-going kids and help them shine in academics. The companies are to provide solar home lighting systems so the children can study after dark without suffering the heat and toxic fumes of kerosene lamps.The project is to be implemented in districts with high consumption of kerosene on "area saturation" basis. Money would come from CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds, aggregating about Rs 1,000 crore a year.Data for the last census conducted in 2011 show 47% households using kerosene for lighting. The solar initiative is aimed at reducing use of kerosene for lighting purpose and prune subsidy. The companies had some years back funded cooking gas connections for Delhi's poor to make the Capital kerosene-free city.India consumes about 59 million tonne of kerosene, a little less than diesel. But several studies have said nearly 40% of the poor man's fuel sold through ration shops flows into the black market for adulteration due to subsidy, pegged at Rs 34.43 a litre at present.Sources said the chief executives of all the big oil firms \u2013 IndianOil, ONGC, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, GAIL, Oil India \u2013 and senior oil ministry officials discussed the plan earlier this month at the Petroleum and Planning Analysis Cell, the ministry's data monitor.The idea originally came from the ministry of new and renewable energy which sought a role for the oil companies in its "million solar lights project being implemented with IIT-Bombay. The idea behind dovetailing the oil companies' CSR is to bring down kerosene consumption and reduce subsidy outgo.The oil ministry's economic division thinks solar lamps could replace kerosene as a lighting fuel. Two options for implementing the initiative are being weighed \u2013 either through IIT-Bombay as part of the existing project or a separate rollout by the companies.The project is part of the outgoing UPA-2 government's efforts at ramping up solar power usage. But the project and liberal funding from oil companies \u2013 and subsequently even power companies \u2013 could come in handy for the outreach plan of the BJP if the party forms the next government at the Centre. The party's manifesto stressed solar power as a key ingredient of ensuring India's energy security.

VResearchers have said that such conditions increase the risk of floods and droughts. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aEven as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the monsoon will be \u201cbelow normal\u201d this year, researchers at Stanford University, California, have concluded that monsoon in India is becoming more extreme, with significant increase in both wet and dry spells. They have said that such conditions increase the risk of floods and droughts.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe South Asian summer monsoon directly affects the lives of one-sixth of the world\u2019s population. There is substantial variability within the monsoon season, including fluctuations between periods of heavy rainfall and low rainfall. These fluctuations can cause extreme dry and wet conditions that adversely impact agricultural yields, water resources, infrastructure and human systems,\u201d says the paper, which has been published in the journal, Nature Climate Change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe findings are crucial as continuing trends in wet spells can imply increased flooding risk in parts of the region. As we have seen recently in many parts of India, this can lead to loss of lives, spread of diseases and destruction of property\u2026 Further, increase in dry spells can also have substantial impact on crop yields, as has been noted in many places including Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh,\u201d said Deepti Singh, lead author of the paper, from the Department of Environmental Earth System Science, Stanford University, in an interview with The Indian Express.\u000a\u000aShe said that based on discussions with researchers at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the duration and frequency of dry spells can be extremely important early in the agricultural cycle (July-August).\u000a\u000aThe paper uses statistical methods to analyse changes in several rainfall characteristics between two 30-year periods \u2014 1951-1980 and 1981-2011. The data, collected from the IMD, shows that when rainfall occurs, it is much heavier. Moreover, there are several more periods of below-normal rainfall during the peak-monsoon months, although they may not be as severe.\u000a\u000aThese results suggest that combined with increasing exposure and vulnerability associated with rapid population growth, land-use change and groundwater depletion, these changing climatic extremes are likely to pose a greater disaster risk to the region. \u201cThe observed changes are relevant for managing climate related risks, with particular relevance for water resources, agriculture, disaster preparedness and infrastructure planning,\u201d the paper concludes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese results suggest that we are already seeing significant changes similar to what are expected in response to increased greenhouse gas warming. They support anecdotal evidence of climate change by farmers. Some local governments have already had to deal with the consequences of these changes, including the increasing incidences of farmer suicides,\u201d said Singh.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App

VUS farmers can grow more corn than ever before thanks to genetic modifications and improved planting techniques, but the crops are also increasingly vulnerable to drought, researchers said today.\u000a\u000aThe study in the journal Science found that "densely planted corn appears to be unexpectedly more sensitive to water scarcity," raising concerns about future food supply as the planet warms.\u000a\u000aThe United States is the largest exporter of corn in the world, shipping about 40 per cent of the world's corn.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, most commercially produced corn has been modified with new traits that make roots better able to access water and build in pest resistance.\u000a\u000aThat has allowed farmers to plant more corn and set the plants more closely together than they could in the past, resulting in higher yields.\u000a\u000aBut the plants have also become more susceptible to dry spells over the past two decades, which is a concern because most corn crops in the United States rely on natural rain, not irrigation.\u000a\u000aIf predictions for future climate in the midwestern US -- known as the Corn Belt -- are correct, then corn yields could fall 15 to 30 per cent over the next half century, scientists said.\u000a\u000aThe study was led by David Lobell of Stanford University, and was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u000a\u000a"Recent yield progress is overall a good story. But because farm yields are improving fastest in favorable weather, the stakes for having such weather are rising," Lobell said.\u000a\u000a"In other words, the negative impacts of hot and are rising at the same time that climate change is expected to bring more such weather."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSoybeans, which are often genetically modified in the United States but have not been more densely planted in recent years, have not become more susceptible to drought the way corn has, Lobell and colleagues said.\u000a\u000aThe study was based on an analysis of more than one million USDA crop insurance records between 1995 and 2012.\u000a\u000a"The study raises a potentially grave concern beyond 2050, when yields are projected to decline at an accelerating rate," said an accompanying editorial by Donald Ort and Stephen Long of the University of Illinois.\u000a\u000aChanging the way corn is planted can only go so far toward solving the problem, they wrote. The key lies in reducing harmful carbon emissions, caused mainly by burning fossil fuels, which boost global warming.\u000a\u000a"The only real solution will be to avoid the CO2 emissions that will otherwise cause rises in temperature.

VForecasts by the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum and the India Meteorological Department indicate that the south-west monsoon rainfall may be deficient. Also, there is a possibility of the evolution of an El Nio event during June to September. There is a 45 per cent probability that central, west, north-west and south India will receive below normal rainfall. There is also a 40 per cent chance that eastern States like Odisha, West Bengal, the north-east, and most of Jammu and Kashmir may get normal rains during the south-west monsoon period. Paddy arrivals in the market are also sluggish, indicating that actual production is either lower than the estimated production of 107 million tonnes of rice, or that some of the stocks is being held back in the anticipation of a higher price.\u000a\u000aIn the current scenario of climate change, predictions of extreme weather events are becoming difficult. In March-April this year, we had unexpected hailstorms and heavy rainfall in parts of central and north-west India. Outside India also, most of California is experiencing extreme drought with storage levels in the major reservoirs as well as lakes well below historic levels. Australia experienced what has been described as the Millennium drought which led to the growth of water markets and to renewed emphasis on water security measures.\u000a\u000aIn India, unlike in the United States and Australia, agriculture is not just a food producing enterprise but also the backbone of the livelihood security of nearly 60 per cent of the population. Therefore, there is no time to relax in the area of taking anticipatory steps to safeguard food, water, energy and livelihood security in rural India, in the event of an erratic monsoon. We should initiate proactive steps immediately to ensure food and drinking water security for not only people but also for the over one billion farm animal population. Aberrations in monsoon behaviour are not uncommon, having been with us throughout our agricultural history. What is new is the difficulty in forecasting caused by factors coming under the generic title, \u201cClimate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe recent report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of higher mean temperatures and a rise in sea level if we do not take action on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions. The low carbon pathway of development still remains a topic for academic discussion rather than for political and practical action. International prices of food and other agricultural commodities tend to remain volatile. The right to food enshrined in the National Food Security Act can be implemented only with the help of our farmers, unlike the right to information which can be implemented with the help of files. Right now, the government has enough stock to fulfil the legal obligation of providing 5 kg of wheat, rice or millets per month to nearly 75 per cent of our population. With one widespread drought, the current food stocks may disappear. Even this year, market arrivals of paddy have been as low as 42 per cent in West Bengal, 34 per cent in Bihar and 23 per cent in Odisha. Hence, there is no time to relax in the areas of food production and safe storage\u000a\u000aFortunately, we still have a large untapped production reservoir in most foodgrains even with technologies available on the shelf. What is important is the mobilisation of group endeavour among farm families with small holdings in areas such as plant protection, water harvesting and post-harvest technologies. The new government must accord priority to both water security and water use efficiency. Water harvesting in homes, farms and factories must become mandatory. Tamil Nadu has already initiated steps in this direction. The rain-cum-solar energy centre functioning in Chennai is a source of credible public information on rainwater harvesting and solar energy use. Such centres need to be replicated in all our cities, towns and block headquarters.\u000a\u000aThe latest technologies for using the available water in the most efficient manner possible should be adopted. On fertilizer use efficiency, there are technologies such as those developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) in the U.S. which can help improve the efficiency of urea use by about 50 per cent. Methods of managing the triple alliance of pests, pathogens and weeds must be popularised.\u000a\u000aBesides causing food and water shortage, deficient rainfall adds to the problem of energy shortage. In every calamity lies an opportunity for progress. Harvesting of the sun in homes, offices, fields and factories should also become mandatory; it can help increase energy supply in rural and urban areas. At the post-harvest stage, a national grain storage policy with these three components must be adopted \u2014 we should promote the use of small storage bins, like the Pusa Bin, at the farm level. Second, we should implement the rural godown scheme for safe storage of foodgrains and perishable commodities at the village level. Such a rural godown scheme was introduced as early as 1979, but the programme has yet to take off in a manner that can make a difference to preventing the loss of food items at the village/block levels. Third, we should establish a national grid of ultramodern foodgrain silos in at least 50 locations in the country, each capable of storing about a million tonnes. Unfortunately, there is still a mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies, with producers and consumers unable to get the full benefit of higher production.\u000a\u000aFor the food and water security of farm animals, we need to earmark potential areas for establishing cattle camps where the animals can be looked after during a drought emergency. These camps should have access to water. A suggestion I had made over three decades ago that we should identify and establish groundwater sanctuaries at appropriate places is yet to be implemented. These are concealed aquifers which should be tapped only when absolutely essential. Like a wildlife sanctuary, they should be protected from exploitation. The establishment of such sanctuaries \u2014 at least one each in the 130 agroclimatic zones generally identified in our country \u2014 will help us to save precious cattle and other farm animals, both from distress sale and starvation deaths.\u000a\u000aAs the speaker in the \u201cSardar Patel Memorial lecture\u201d series on All India Radio, which I delivered in 1973, I had suggested that we should develop drought, flood and good weather codes to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable monsoons and to maximise production in a good monsoon year. The drought code consists of a series of dos and don\u2019ts during deficient rainfall. As in the case of drought and flood codes, seed banks consisting of seeds of alternative crops should be maintained. Seed reserves are as important for crop security as grain reserves are important for food security. For example, during the recent and severe drought in California, it was found that some of the earlier crops like millets had survived with a reasonable yield, while wheat or rice could not withstand the severe drought.\u000a\u000aFortunately in our National Food Security Act, there is provision to procure and supply under the Public Distribution System, local grains like ragi, bajra, jowar and a whole series of minor millets. Since such crops require milling, they have been referred to as coarse cereals. They should be referred to as climate smart nutri cereals. They are now being provided at Rs.1 per kg \u2014 an extremely attractive price from the point of view of resource poor consumers. Such underutilised crops are now known to be rich in macro and micronutrients and could help in the fight against protein hunger caused by the deficiency of protein in diets and hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B. If the Food Security Act is backed by a nutrition literacy movement, the demand for climate smart nutri-cereals will grow. This will help in promoting the cultivation of crops which may do better under drought conditions.\u000a\u000aIn each of the major agroclimatic zones, at least two members (a woman and a man) of every panchayat or local body should be trained to be climate risk managers. They can help the rest of the community in implementing the provisions of the proposed drought, flood and good weather codes. The government has recently introduced a national policy on agroforestry. Agroforestry combines the benefits of carbon sequestration and local food security. The inclusion of fertilizer trees in agroforestry systems can help build soil carbon banks.\u000a\u000aThis year is the International Year of Family Farming. Family farming is both a way of life and a means to livelihood. India has probably the largest number of family farmers. Our aim should be to make every family farm a climate smart farm, equipped with the knowledge and technologies essential to manage the expected El Nio triggered adverse rainfall conditions.\u000a\u000a(Prof. M.S.

VInvesting in projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries can yield billions of dollars worth of additional benefits in areas ranging from employment to health, a report published on Thursday said.In the peer-reviewed study, economists from Australia-based Net Balance analysed the environmental and socio-economic benefits from clean energy or carbon-cutting projects approved by carbon credit certifier the Gold Standard "Robustly designed and audited greenhouse gas mitigation projects ... deliver far more than carbon emission reductions, meaning it is no longer necessary to choose between climate and other environment and development outcomes," the report said.The study comes weeks after the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimated the impact of policies to curb greenhouse gases worldwide would slow global economic growth by 0.06 percent annually through the rest of the century."What the IPCC did not include in this economic assessment was a valuation of the multiple positive outcomes beyond carbon that can be delivered by reducing energy consumption, switching to clean energy systems and saving forests," the report said.The study, commissioned by Geneva-based Gold Standard and green group WWF Switzerland, identified areas beyond greenhouse gas cuts that may benefit from projects, such as local economies, employment, health and biodiversity.The more than 100 initiatives analysed include building wind farms, planting trees, and installing water filtration systems and distributing clean stoves to deter people from burning wood or charcoal.Under the Gold Standard programme, each project generates carbon credits that can be bought by individuals and organisations to offset their own carbon footprints.The report found that, for example, three water filtration systems throughout Africa and Asia approved by the Gold Standard are delivering health benefits such as less air pollution, valued at more than $300 million annually.Fifty-four Gold Standard-certified wind farms have created jobs worth $12 million a year while contributing a total $100 million per year to countries' balance of payments.Governments are currently wrangling over which countries should take on a heavier burden in cutting greenhouse gas emissions under a new treaty to be agreed at U.N. talks in 2015.

VLONDON: The collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , which holds enough water to raise global seas by several feet, has begun.University of Washington researchers have used detailed topography maps and computer modelling to confirm that the sheet has started to thin.In some places, the Thwaites Glacier has been found to be losing tens of feet or several meters, of elevation per year.The fast-moving Thwaites Glacier will likely disappear in a matter of centuries, researchers say, raising sea level by nearly 2 feet.That glacier also acts as a linchpin on the rest of the ice sheet, which contains enough ice to cause another 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) of global sea level rise.Scientists have been warning of its collapse, based on theories, but with few firm predictions or timelines."There's been a lot of speculation about the stability of marine ice sheets, and many scientists suspected that this kind of behaviour is under way," said Ian Joughin, a glaciologist at the UW's Applied Physics Laboratory. "This study provides a more quantitative idea of the rates at which the collapse could take place".The good news is that while the word "collapse" implies a sudden change, the fastest scenario is 200 years, and the longest is more than 1,000 years. The bad news is that such a collapse may be inevitable."Previously, when we saw thinning we didn't necessarily know whether the glacier could slow down later, spontaneously or through some feedback," Joughin said. "In our model simulations it looks like all the feedbacks tend to point toward it actually accelerating over time; there's no real stabilizing mechanism we can see".The new study used airborne radar, developed at the University of Kansas to image through the thick ice and map the topography of the underlying bedrock, whose shape controls the ice sheet's long-term stability. The mapping was done as part of NASA's Operation IceBridge, and included other instruments to measure the height of the ice sheet's rapidly thinning surface.UW researchers combined that data with their own satellite measurements of ice surface speeds. Their computer model was able to reproduce the glacier's ice loss during the past 18 years, and they ran the model forward under different amounts of ocean-driven melting. The place where the glacier meets land, the grounding line, now sits on a shallower ridge with a depth of about 2,000 feet (600 meters). Results show that as the ice edge retreats into the deeper part of the bay, the ice face will become steeper and, like a towering pile of sand, the fluid glacier will become less stable and collapse out toward the sea."Once it really gets past this shallow part, it's going to start to lose ice very rapidly," Joughin said.The study considered future scenarios using faster or slower melt rates depending on the amount of future warming. The fastest melt rate led to the early stages lasting 200 years, after which the rapid-stage collapse began. The slowest melt rate kept most of the ice for more than a millennium before the onset of rapid collapse. The most likely scenarios may be between 200 and 500 years, Joughin said."All of our simulations show it will retreat at less than a millimeter of sea level rise per year for a couple of hundred years, and then, boom, it just starts to really go," Joughin said.The thinning of the ice in recent decades is most likely related to climate change, Joughin said. More emissions would lead to more melting and faster collapse, but other factors make it hard to predict how much time we could buy under different scenarios.

VResearchers have revealed their fears that unless we control methane now we may not be many years away from an environmental tipping point - and disaster.\u000a\u000aRobert Howarth, greenhouse gas expert and ecology and environmental biology professor, said they have to control methane immediately, and natural gas is the largest methane pollution source in the US.\u000a\u000aHe said that if Earth hits a climate-system tipping point because of methane, then our carbon dioxide problem is immaterial, asserting that we have to get a handle on methane, or increasingly risk global catastrophe.\u000a\u000aHowarth points to "radiative forcing," a measure of trapped heat in Earth's atmosphere from man-made greenhouse gases. The current role of methane looms large, he says, contributing over 40 percent of current radiative forcing from all greenhouse gases, based on the latest from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u000a\u000aThe role of methane as a driver of global warming is even more critical than this 40 percent value might indicate, Howarth notes. The climate system responds much more quickly to reducing methane than to carbon dioxide. If society aggressively controlled carbon dioxide emissions, but ignored methane emissions, the planet would warm to the dangerous 1.5 to 2.0 degree Celsius threshold within 15 to 35 years. By reducing methane emissions, society buys some critical decades of lower temperatures.\u000a\u000aThe study has been published in the journal Energy and Engineering.

VUS President wants to force coal energy plants to reduce emissions and pay for greenhouse gases they do emit through a cap and trade system, the New York Times said today.\u000a\u000aAsked by AFP, the did not confirm that such a plan is being considered by the president, who has struggled to fulfil his campaign promises on fighting climate change, with most of his initiatives blocked by lawmakers in since 2009.\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Times, Obama will bypass legislative avenues by using his executive authority to force coal power plants to reduce their emissions by 20 per cent. The president plans to announce the program on Monday, the newspaper said.\u000a\u000aThe idea is to create a national cap on carbon emissions from coal and to let each decide how to get there through increasing energy production from wind, solar and other renewable sources, and by creating a marketplace where "government-issued pollution permits" can be bought and sold between states.\u000a\u000aThe plan risks sparking hostility from local governments under Republican control, which have already brought lawsuits over whether the Environmental Protection Agency, under Obama's executive authority, has the power to regulate emissions.\u000a\u000aThe expected presidential announcement would be part of a set of initiatives he unveiled in June 2013 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 per cent from their 2005 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aAccording to the US Energy Information Agency, 37 per cent of electricity in the US is produced from coal plants.

VSesame Street's Kermit the Frog once lamented that "it's not easy bein' green". Today, this sentiment is surprisingly relevant to the global economy - only it is becoming green that is the problem.\u000a\u000aLast September, the Intergovernmental Panel for warned that if the world sticks with "business as usual", global temperatures may rise more than four degrees Celsius - far beyond the two degree Celsius increase that has been deemed "safe." This prompted UN Secretary General to challenge political, economic and financial leaders in January to intensify their efforts to achieve a new global agreement on by 2015.\u000a\u000aBut, as important as high-level deals are, they will amount to little unless they are backed by considerable investment in areas like smart grids, energy storage and renewables. Indeed, the estimates that nearly $1 trillion worth of investment will be needed annually between now and 2050 to put the world economy on a more sustainable path.\u000a\u000aWhile that may seem like a lot of money, it is the equivalent of only one per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP), and less than 0.3 per cent of global financial assets. Moreover, since 2007, major central banks have proved that they can augment their balance sheets by more than $1 trillion annually, without triggering inflation. In other words, the world can afford the transition towards a green economy.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, last year, green investment amounted to only $254 billion - implying an annual shortfall of nearly $750 billion. To bridge the gap, advanced-country governments are leveraging their limited public funds to catalyse private sector investment. At the same time, developing countries are rapidly increasing their contributions to green finance, with domestic clean-energy financing in non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries having surpassed OECD-country levels in 2008.\u000a\u000aBut the problem remains that the current structure of markets impedes their ability to adjust to What is really needed is not money, but the political will to correct market failure by bringing about fundamental shifts in the metrics, institutions and policies that govern how investors evaluate economic activities.\u000a\u000aA green project is bankable only if it provides a clear view of its real costs and benefits. The return on private capital (profit and loss) plus the return on "social" capital must be positive. The current GDP metric ignores the negative externalities of fossil fuel-based private activities, leading to overwhelming pollution and gross wastage of non-renewable natural resources. Without full cost accounting, some of the worst activities will continue to be immensely profitable.\u000a\u000aA successful transition to a green economy will require a new set of metrics. The good news is that some governments have already moved to establish a shadow cost for CO2 In the US, the "social cost" of carbon was raised from $24 to $37 per tonne emitted. Publicising fine-particulate (so-called PM2.5) levels was critical to mobilising widespread Chinese public support for addressing air pollution. Similar metrics are now needed to measure other forms of natural capital destruction, such as deforestation, marine-reef bleaching, wastewater discharge, and soil degradation.\u000a\u000aOnce these metrics are established, they must be incorporated into international accounting standards for private and public financial statements. Some companies are already releasing annual reports with full details on their activities' social and environmental impact, and will eventually move towards fully integrated reporting.\u000a\u000aBut bringing about real change will require more than moral suasion. Policymakers must take advantage of the full range of tools available to them, including legislation, reporting guidelines, taxes, incentives and public education about the costs of inaction. Financial regulators in emerging economies like Bangladesh and China have already taken a step in the right direction, introducing rules to promote financial inclusion. China's green credit banking guidelines call upon financial institutions to consider the environmental risks in their loan portfolios.\u000a\u000aFinally, there needs to be an honest discussion on the merits - and limits - of current monetary policy and financial regulation. Central bank subsidies like quantitative easing and near-zero interest rates should have increased the supply of low-cost financing for green projects. Instead, they have boosted the profits of ever-larger financial institutions, leaving credit to small and medium-size enterprises and long-term projects severely constrained.\u000a\u000aThe irony is that regulations aimed at strengthening financial stability tend to reward short-termism (higher liquidity), adding risk-weights and costs to long-term projects - that is, most green investments. Regulators must recognise that if the real economy is unsustainable, no amount of bank reforms will protect people's livelihoods, let alone the financial system. Adding a green investment requirement of just 0.5 per cent would be sufficient to cover the annual financing gap.\u000a\u000aThe global financial crisis occurred because we ignored externalities - shadow prices and institutions - allowing instability and inequality to proliferate. Building a more stable, sustainable future requires getting policies, prices and incentives right. It will not be easy, as Kermit said, but the risk is that if we do not act, we get boiled before we become green.\u000a\u000aThe writer is at the Fung Global Institute, Hong Kong.

VKOLKATA: Despite the retreating of glaciers in Himalayas, water supply in rivers like Ganga, Brahmaputra and Indus will increase in the coming decades, a new study said.The study was conducted jointly by research organization FutureWater, Netherlands' Utrecht University and the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development."Our results show that the river flow will increase at least until 2050, despite retreating glaciers," researcher Arthur Lutz said in a statement on Monday."The glaciers feeding Indus river, although retreating, will generate increasing amounts of melt-water in the coming decades due to higher temperatures. For the other rivers, the increase in river flow is mainly caused by increasing precipitation," the researchers said.Glacier and snowmelt contribute water to ten important river basins originating from the Himalayas and in the Tibetan plateau serving over 1.3 billion people.The group of scientists assessed the importance of meltwater for Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra, Salween and Mekong rivers and discovered how climate change will alter river flow in the coming decades.The findings of the study will be important in shaping climate change adaptation policy in the 12 riparian countries surrounding these river basins.Co-researcher Walter Immerzeel said, "These results confirm on a larger scale what we already discovered last year for two small watersheds in the Indus and Ganga basins".The scientists emphasize that their projections are only until 2050. Scenarios for the distant future, or until the end of the century, remain uncertain, in particular for Indus river where melt-water is most important.

We have to cut down the amount of emissions we are putting into the atmosphere if, in the future, we want to have anything like the earth we have now," Cusack added.\u000a\u000aFor their analysis, the researchers focused the investigation on the five strategies that appear to hold the most promise: reducing emissions, sequestering carbon through biological means on land and in the ocean, storing carbon dioxide in a liquefied form in underground geological formations and wells, increasing the earth's cloud cover and solar reflection.\u000a\u000aOf those approaches, none came close to reducing emissions as much as conservation, increased energy efficiency and low-carbon fuels would.\u000a\u000aOf the five options the group evaluated, sequestering carbon through biological means - or converting atmospheric carbon into solid sources of carbon like plants - holds the most promise.\u000a\u000aOne source, curbing the destruction of forests and promoting growth of new forests, could tie up as much as 1.3 gigatons of carbon in plant material annually, the team calculated.\u000a\u000aDeforestation now is responsible for adding 1 gigaton of carbon each year to the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThe findings appeared in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

VResearchers have said that reducing emissions will be the primary way to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aDaniela Cusack, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of geography in UCLA's College of Letters and Science, said they found that climate engineering doesn't offer a perfect option.\u000a\u000aShe said that the perfect option is reducing emissions.\u000a\u000aStill, the study concluded, some approaches to climate engineering are more promising than others, and they should be used to augment efforts to reduce the 9 gigatons of carbon dioxide being released each year by human activity. (A gigaton is 1 billion tons.)\u000a\u000aThe first scholarly attempt to rank a wide range of approaches to minimizing climate change in terms of their feasibility, cost-effectiveness, risk, public acceptance, governability and ethics.\u000a\u000aOf the five options the group evaluated, sequestering carbon through biological means - or converting atmospheric carbon into solid sources of carbon like plants - holds the most promise. One source, curbing the destruction of forests and promoting growth of new forests, could tie up as much as 1.3 gigatons of carbon in plant material annually, the team calculated. Deforestation now is responsible for adding 1 gigaton of carbon each year to the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThe study also advocates a less familiar form of biological sequestration: the burial of biochar. The process, which uses high temperatures and high pressure to turn plants into charcoal, releases little carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Under normal conditions, decaying plant life inevitably decomposes, a process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aBut charred plant material takes significantly longer - sometimes centuries - to decompose. So the approach can work to keep carbon that has become bound up in plant life from decaying and respiring as carbon dioxide. And like working slash into the soil, adding biochar to soil can improve its fertility and water retention.

Plenty for US President domestically perhaps.\u000a\u000aUnable to persuade the US Congress to pass a law, he has used his executive powers to get the decision out.\u000a\u000a"It will send a good signal to nations everywhere that one of the world's biggest emitters is taking the future of the planet and its people seriously," says Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN convention. "I fully expect action by the to spur others in taking concrete action (under the new 2015 global agreement which is currently being negotiated)."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFigueres may well have got her assessment wrong. As executive secretary of a multilateral body which has suffered from the absolute inaction from the US for two decades, she may be latching on to the straw US offers now. But, for the international community it could well mean very little.\u000a\u000aThis target is only one element of the objectives the committed itself to way back in 2010. The US had then said it would reduce its emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aMany experts, such as Martin Khor, note that if the 17 per cent reduction target set by the US is compared with the global efforts, one would get the real picture. Most take 1990 as the base year under the Kyoto Protocol (which US refused to sign on) to measure the extent of reduction. Convert the US target to the 1990 base level and it turns out that Obama's revolutionary move promises a near zero per cent reduction below 1990 levels by 2020. In comparison, even the EU has committed to a 20 per cent reduction level by 2020 below 1990 levels (it is well on way to achieve that having already met 12 per cent plus of that target in 2013).\u000a\u000aNow, the hullaballoo over the US announcement of 30 per cent emission reduction below 2005 levels from by 2030 only sets the US on way to achieving this overall minuscule target. Experts say that this too is not achieved by any painful overall reduction in either energy consumption levels or any massive doses of investments in super clean coal technologies that the world has not seen as yet.\u000a\u000aUS from coal power generation went down by 10 per cent below 2005 levels by 2011 largely because it shifted instead to natural gas from shale reserves. Over this period US' dependence on coal reduced by 14 per cent. US coal consumption peaked in 2005 when it used 22.80 quadrliion Btu of it. It has fallen since, but the US predicts it to rise back to 19.70 quadrillion Btu - almost the same as the 2011 levels - by 2030 and yet stay 15 per cent below 2005 levels while it reduces emissions by 30 per cent over this period. At the same time, its use of natural gas is slated to rise from 22.60 to 26.8 quadrillion Btu by 2030.\u000a\u000aSo, for the rest of the world looking at the biggest historical emitter with expectations, the announcement conveys that the US has finally begun putting things in place at home to meet the small target it promised a while back. But the world, especially the developing world, does not really need to sound grateful for the US President to be able to overcome his domestic tribulations.\u000a\u000aStudies such as those by Stockholm Environment Institute have shown, put together, the developing world is right now committed to a larger volume of emission reductions by 2020 as compared to the developed countries. That does not change with the much-expected new US announcement, it only reiterates the imbalance. Anyone who believes otherwise should watch how the mistrust between the developed countries and others, created out of this continued imbalance, plays out yet again in the UN climate negotiations that re-start on June 4.\u000a\u000aMany experts believe that countries such as China and India do need to do more to reduce emissions under the new global and long-term agreement. But, they need to do it in their own interests while keeping in sight the past and future projected emissions of all other countries. It would be naive to believe that a US, which takes marginal emission cuts in near future and leaves the difficult decisions to after 2050, can convince emerging economies to do otherwise. As much as countries such as India need to find a way to de-link their emissions from their growth, if the US and other developed countries want to lead, they have to show how an economy can be maintained while reducing their energy footprint. Only the two together could put the world on a path that keeps global temperature rise below two degrees by the turn of the century.

Also, the oil sector, public sector units have large funds available under their corporate social responsibility programmes. This will be ploughed towards the new firms,\u201d said the government official quoted above.\u000a\u000aThe Bharatiya Janata Party that swept to power in the April-May general election under the leadership of Narendra Modi has stressed the need for reinforcing energy security.\u000a\u000aThe Modi-led government\u2019s energy security plans include harnessing renewable sources such as solar energy, biomass and wind power along with coal, gas, hydropower and nuclear power to bring about an \u201cenergy revolution\u201d in the country.\u000a\u000aIndia, which is dependent on imports to meet its energy demand, has an energy import bill of around $150 billion. This is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030, requiring a $3.6 trillion payout by 2030.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy government will come out with a comprehensive National Energy Policy and focus on development of energy-related infrastructure, human resource and technology,\u201d President Pranab Mukherjee told Parliament on 9 June. \u201cThe aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeveloping renewable energy will also help reduce dependence on coal, which is in short supply domestically, requiring imports of the mineral to fuel most of India\u2019s power plants.\u000a\u000aIndia is also exploring options to make it compulsory for conventional power project developers to build renewable capacity at the same location, a move that can provide an impetus to ecofriendly electricity. There is a need to integrate conventional and renewable power generation as India\u2019s overdependence on coal needs to be reversed.

VLondon: Coal dominated world energy markets last year by supplying the biggest share of demand since 1970, making it the fastest growing fossil fuel, according to an annual review by BP Plc.\u000a\u000aConsumption grew 3% last year, driven by coal use in developing nations, according to a statement on Monday from Europe\u2019s third-largest oil company. Use of renewables such as solar and wind also reached a record, accounting for 2.7% of all energy demand.\u000a\u000aThe findings are another indication that consumers are prioritizing cheap fuels over efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and use of it expanded at utilities from China to Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cEurope is increasing its carbon emissions because it\u2019s using too much coal because it\u2019s cheap,\u201d Royal Dutch Shell Plc\u2019s chief financial officer Simon Henry said in an interview on Bloomberg Television 3 June.\u000a\u000aCoal\u2019s share of global energy use reached 30.1%, just below the 32.9% share for crude oil, which lost market share for a 14th consecutive year. China was the world\u2019s biggest coal consumer, followed by the US and India.\u000a\u000aIn China, coal accounted for 67.5% of the total energy demand, the lowest on record because of new measures to combat pollution. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels use grew by 4.2%, or 358 metric tonnes, the slowest in five years, the report showed.\u000a\u000aThe big story in coal markets is China, Christof Ruehl, BP\u2019s chief economist, said on Monday at a presentation in Moscow. New policies to combat local pollution by shutting down coal- intensive production and encouraging coal substitution may have played a part in cutting the fuel\u2019s dominance to the lowest on record.\u000a\u000aNatural gas consumption rose 1.4%, below the historical average of 2.6%, to account for 23.7% of world primary energy use. Gas demand growth was below average everywhere but North America, where hydraulic fracturing technology opened new supplies.\u000a\u000aThat so-called fracking technique also helped boost oil supply in the US, which had record output, a trend that will continue this year, Ruehl said.\u000a\u000aDisruptions in oil-producing nations such as Libya, Sudan and Nigeria were offset by the increase in US production from shale and other tight geological formations where supplies are difficult to extract with traditional techniques.\u000a\u000aThis underlines the importance of continuing to secure these new supplies through continued access to new resources, policies to encourage markets and investment, and the application of new technologies worldwide, BP\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) Bob Dudley said in the statement.\u000a\u000aWorldwide, energy consumption rose 2.3% in 2013, faster than the 1.8% pace of the year before but below the 10-year average of 2.5%, BP said. Emerging economies accounted for 80% of demand growth.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s energy consumption rose by 4.7%, below the 10-year average of 8.6%, BP said. Bloomberg

V\u201cAll nations must take on binding commitments in an appropriate legal form.\u201d I added this sentence to my prepared text at the very last minute after much cogitation while addressing the U.N. Climate Change Conference at Cancn, Mexico on December 8, 2010. The conference came after the much-heralded Copenhagen meet. Bouquets from all over the world and brickbats from India followed immediately. The Mexican President and Foreign Minister were all praise for India\u2019s pragmatism. President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives said that for the first time he felt confident that India was serious about addressing the special concerns of countries like his, while Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly lauded India\u2019s constructive contributions. But at home, I was pilloried by influential non-governmental organisations, by large sections of the media, and by the present Finance Minister in Parliament.\u000a\u000aExplanation for the addition\u000a\u000aOn December 17, 2010, I addressed a detailed eight-page letter to all Members of Parliament explaining the immediate context in which the impromptu addition was made. A majority of developing and developed countries were pushing for a legally binding agreement. Most countries including our BASIC quartet partners Brazil and South Africa, our developing country partners in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Least Developed Countries, Africa and four of our SAARC colleagues shared this view. The opposition came mainly from the U.S., China, India, the Philippines, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Saudi Arabia. I felt it was important for India to demonstrate that it was not completely oblivious to the views and opinions of very large sections of the global community, especially those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aIn my letter, I explained to the MPs that (i) commitments in an \u201cappropriate legal form\u201d are not a \u201clegally-binding commitment\u201d and that commitments made by the government to our own Parliament in the form of domestic legislation that contain performance targets for mitigation are also \u201can appropriate legal form\u201d; and (ii) the commitments did in no way imply that India was taking on absolute emission cuts or agreeing to any peaking year for its emissions. I went on to add that this deliberate nuancing of our traditional hard line position would actually expand negotiating options for us and give us an all-round advantageous standing. The MPs appreciated the detailed explanation and I was naturally more than happy when I got a written reply on December 24, 2010 from Mr. Jaswant Singh saying: \u201cI would not bother overmuch about the ersatz generated on account of our rather feeble understanding of the difference between \u2018legally binding\u2019 and an \u2018appropriate legal form.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aActually, India played a crucial role in rescuing and reviving the multilateral negotiating process in Cancn. But this did not get adequate appreciation at home because of the furore over the impromptu addition. There were at least four distinctive contributions. First, it was India that ensured for the first time that developed country mitigation actions will be subject to \u201cinternational assessment and review,\u201d which means that experts including those from developing countries will have the right to review whether developed countries are living up to their commitments. Second, it was India that ensured the inclusion of the phrase \u201cequitable access to sustainable development.\u201d This was superior to the phrase \u201cequitable access to carbon space,\u201d which somehow connotes a fundamental \u201cright to pollute.\u201d Third, India\u2019s detailed formulation on \u201cinternational consultation and analysis\u201d of developing country mitigation actions in a manner that is non-intrusive, non-punitive and respectful of national sovereignty was the key intervention that broke an acrimonious deadlock and helped take Cancn forward. Fourth, India\u2019s formulations formed the basis of the consensus reached on technology development and sharing in both mitigation and adaptation.\u000a\u000aSubstance and style\u000a\u000aIn a meeting convened on the sidelines by the President of Mexico, Felipe Caldern, on public-private partnerships, I called for the establishment of a Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)-type network of technology development and dissemination institutions in the area of climate change. I specifically mentioned how India\u2019s high-yielding wheat varieties in the 1960s came from a CGIAR institution in Mexico. I recall this suggestion being endorsed enthusiastically by President Calderon and also by Professor Mario Molina, the 1995 Nobel Laureate.\u000a\u000aOur negotiating stance on climate change must not be guided by dogma or inflexibility. It should be anchored in three principles: (i) the need to protect our economic growth and poverty eradication agenda; (ii) the pursuit of our domestic environmental policies; and (iii) the achievement of our foreign policy objectives. At all times, India must be seen as a constructive, a willing-to-engage and a solution-oriented player in global negotiations. Substance is as important as style in all such global meets. We may have a strong case but often lose out because of the polemical manner in which we put across our point of view, our eagerness to score debating points, our pride in the use of the English language and the fact that we are frequently seen as not being patient listeners. We earn disrepute by being needlessly argumentative and unyielding. To make our multilateral diplomacy effective, we must keep all channels of communication, even with those with differing perspectives, open and official and build up bilateral camaraderie. Bilateral meetings do take place on the sidelines of multilateral get-togethers but this is no substitute for substantive year-round engagement.\u000a\u000aIt is true that at times what may appear as obstructionism internationally gets applauded domestically. And political leaders in noisy and sharply competitive democracies like ours cannot afford to neglect reactions back home. But true leadership lies in walking this fine line between safeguarding what we believe is in the national interest while showing courage to take new positions that could well enhance that interest. Negotiating positions can never be frozen, but must actually evolve over time. And our negotiation position gets immeasurably strengthened when we speak from a position of strength. You can star negatively or positively; India accomplished the latter both at Copenhagen and Cancn.\u000a\u000aLow-carbon high GDP growth is not only essential but also eminently feasible through appropriate investment and technology choices and through proper pricing policies. And having faced criticism in Parliament from sections of the present ruling establishment on my arguing for India to take on mitigation responsibilities, I was more than gratified that the President, in his address to Parliament on June 9, 2014, said: \u201cThe government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard.\u201d This is yet another demonstration of a fundamental maxim of parliamentary democracy \u2014 that where you stand depends on where you sit.\u000a\u000a(Jairam Ramesh was Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Environment and Forests, 2009-2011).\u000a\u000aPolitical leaders in noisy and sharply competitive democracies like ours cannot afford to neglect reactions back home. But true leadership lies in walking this fine line between safeguarding what we believe is in the national interest while showing courage to take new positions that could enhance that interest

VEmperor penguins are in danger of dramatic declines by the end of the century due to climate change as melting sea ice will have a ripple effect on the iconic animal's food chain, a new research has warned.\u000a\u000aThe study proposes that the Emperor penguins are "fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEmperor penguins are heavily dependent on sea ice for their livelihoods, and, therefore, are sensitive to changes in sea ice concentration (SIC).\u000a\u000aThe researchers' analysis of the global, continent-wide Emperor penguin population incorporates current and projected future SIC declines, and determined that all of the colonies would be in decline - many by more than 50 per cent - by the end of the century, due to future climate change.\u000a\u000a"If sea ice declines at the rates projected by the IPCC climate models, and continues to influence Emperor penguins as it did in the second half of the 20th century in Terre Adelie, at least two-thirds of the colonies are projected to have declined by greater than 50 per cent from their current size by 2100," said lead author of study Stephanie Jenouvrier from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).\u000a\u000a"None of the colonies, even the southern-most locations in the Ross Sea, will provide a viable refuge by the end of 21st century," Jenouvrier said.\u000a\u000aResearchers have been returning to Terre Adelie, in eastern Antarctica, every year to collect biological measurements of the penguins there, charting the population's growth (and decline), and observing their mating, foraging, chick-rearing patterns.\u000a\u000a"The role of sea ice is complicated," added Jenouvrier.\u000a\u000a"Too much ice requires longer trips for penguin parents to travel to the ocean to hunt and bring back food for their chicks. But too little ice reduces the habitat for krill, a critical food source for emperor penguins. Our models take into account both the effects of too much and too little sea ice in the colony area," said Jenouvrier.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that, while some colonies will increase for a while, this growth is short-lived. By the end of the century at least two-thirds of them will have declined by more than half.\u000a\u000aOf even more concern, all of the colonies are projected to be declining by that time. Although current climate models do not look further into the future than that, a dramatic change would be required to reverse these declines.\u000a\u000a"We propose that the Emperor penguin is fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change, and can act as an iconic example of a new global conservation paradigm for species threatened by future climate change," the study authors said.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

VNEW DELHI: India today said it will play a proactive role to deal with climate change and strengthen the national action plan to tackle global warming.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who discussed a gamut of climate change issues with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius also said that he "welcomed" the French announcement of one billion Euros credit line over next three years to India to take initiates in climate control.France will host the World Climate Conference next year. "We emphasised that India will play a proactive role because climate change is real and we have decided on our national action plan. We will strengthen it further. But we expect the developed world to walk the talk," Javadekar told PTI.The Minister, who had earlier said that the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC was "very important", said the outcome of the previous conferences should be "discussed and negotiated" much earlier and it should not be a last minute affair."We said the draft of outcomes always needs to be discussed and negotiated much earlier than the actual conference. It should not be a last minute affair," he said.Welcoming the French government's announcement to extend credit line over the next three years to India to take initiates in climate control, he said, "After the actual funds arrive...for what they are giving. We will use funds...we can discuss that..whatever riders or conditions...what is the concept of the fund but we welcome".Fabius had yesterday said that he wants to prepare for Conferences of the Parties in close cooperation with India.France will be proposing a credit line of up to 1 billion euros (Rs 8200 crore) over the next 3 years for sustainable infrastructure and urban development in India through Agence Francaise de Development AFD (French development agency), he had said.Javadekar told the French foreign minister that the 100 billion dollars Green Fund should be utilised to purchase critical technologies so that they are available free of cost to developing nations.Javadekar said the developed world must give finances and ensure technology transfer."I had already suggested at the Nairobi platform and that was well received that technology transfer can happen if the Green Fund, which is supposed to be given by the developed world, can be used for IPR purchases of critical technologies."If those critical technologies are purchased by that fund, the technology will be available free of cost and then every country will have its own plan. That idea is well received by the world and I also emphasised that (during the meeting with France Foreign Minister)," Javadekar said.In his speech at the Ministerial Plenary of the First UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi recently, Javadekar had said since it has been agreed to establish the Green Climate Fund of USD 100 billion per year by 2020, this amount should be utilised to purchase IPRs of most crucial technologies for public good.After purchasing IPRs, these technologies should then be freely available to the developing countries to facilitate sustainable development, he said.Elaborating on today's meeting with the French foreign minister, Javadekar said he told Fabius about the Indian "ethos" in which "man, community and nature are all part of one shrishti"."He also discussed French government's ideas for success of the Conferences of the Parties. It was a mutually very important dialogue. We had a good meeting," the Environment minister said.Javadekar said both the countries also discussed on "mutually cooperating on various ideas and share best practises".As the meeting took place in the new Indira Paryavaran Bhavan, a green building, Javadekar told Fabius that they were meeting in a "net zero energy building".

VActions of the developing countries, including India, in the run up to the Paris summit of world leaders in would be predicated on successful operationalisation of the $100 billion Green Climate Fund, the Union environment, forests and minister told the visiting French foreign minister,\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two held closed door confabulations on Monday about the new global agreement on climate change, which is to be agreed upon in Paris in 2015.\u000a\u000aFor hosts France, the Paris meet, where heads of states are expected to converge, is an issue of prestige as well as stress considering the failure of the last heads of state summit in Copenhagen in 2009 which had been panned diplomatic failure. Since the 2009 meet, the role of India and China in the negotiations has only risen, more so after the coming together of the Like-Minded group since past three years.\u000a\u000aSources said, Javadekar informed the French minister that transfer of green technologies and funds for from the developed world would be critical to the success of the Paris meeting. The annual $100 billion is to be capitalised by 2015 but developed countries have shown reluctance to fill the coffers preferring to advocate use a mix of private investments, loans and reclassification of overseas development assistance as green funds. They have also blocked putting up a clear road-map for capitalisation of the funds.\u000a\u000aJavadekar, reiterating an aggressive stance on the prickly issue of on green technologies, also told Fabius, that the Green Funds should be used to buy out of clean technologies to distribute to poor countries. While for the US the talk of remains a red-line, the EU too has pushed the negotiations away from the topic.\u000a\u000adid not attend a public meeting organised by and with the French foreign affairs minister\u2019s on climate change, owing to a protocol faux pass by the organisers. The French minister\u2019s statement at the gathering touched subtly upon differences between the French and other developed countries positions with that of Indian position.\u000a\u000aHe referred to \u2018fair contribution\u2019 by all countries towards global climate change action instead of \u2018equitable contribution\u2019. The use of two phrases in the global negotiations have drastically different implications for emerging countries such as India and China with \u2018 fair contribution\u2019 being seen as a dilution away from India\u2019s insistence upon equity in the international agreement. India along with China has pitched that the principle of equity must be operationalised in the new agreement to be signed at Paris.\u000a\u000aThe Paris meeting is to be preceded by the annual UN summit in end 2014 at Peru where a draft negotiating text of is expected to sketch out the broad framework the global deal. In the period between now and the Peru meet, a host of formal UN meetings, bilateral and plurilateral meetings are also slated. will host his first meeting of BASIC countries, which includes China, South Africa and Brazil on August 7-8 in Delhi. The meeting was slated for May but was cancelled at the last moment by the then environment minister leading to diplomatic embarrassment.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIf it is serious about phasing out ozone-depleting gases by 2030, India needs to evolve a clear stand against persisting with those that have global warming potential and evaluate environmentally-friendly technologies. This is easier said than done as both the Indian government and the industry are hesitant to make some hard choices.\u000a\u000aThe tussle is over the choice of technology and the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty to protect the ozone layer. India wants to discuss the phasing out of HFC under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and not under the Montreal Protocol. This has several implications, not the least of them being that there will not be any binding benchmarks.\u000a\u000aWhat goes against the UNFCCC is that it is not designed for a phase down of specific gases. Countries have the choice to decide, which gases they want to reduce, says Chandra Bhushan, of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).\u000a\u000aFrom Monday, the 34th meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer will be held in Paris. Last week, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) held a preparatory meeting of manufacturers chaired for the first time by the secretary and members of the industry had differences on whether hydrocarbons were a viable replacement in refrigeration and air-conditioning instead of HFCs or HydroFluoroolefins (HFOs).\u000a\u000aHFC is a replacement for ozone-depleting substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). While CFCs and HCFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol, HFCs, on the other hand, have zero ozone-depleting potential but high global warming potential, according to CSE, which is arguing for a direct transition from HCFCs to hydrocarbon based technology.\u000a\u000aPatent issues\u000a\u000aIn India, Godrej has pioneered hydrocarbon technology in refrigerators and later air-conditioners and the company made a presentation to the Ministry. Dilip Rajadhyaksha, senior general manager of Godrej, told The Hindu that hydrocarbons were flammable but safeguards can be put in and the company has expertise since 15 years in this field. It opted for hydrocarbons under a pilot project funded by the GIZ, a German government agency, which funded and helped with the technology under which it carried out pilot manufacturing of air-conditioners using hydrocarbons (propane) from 2010. Before that, since 1999 it has made refrigerators using a blend of propane and isobutane.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have sold ten million fridges so far and over 60,000 air-conditioners, including ones with 1.5 ton capacity, and not a single incident of explosion has taken place,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSome other companies are also going in for hydrocarbon technology spurred by the tightened emission norms this year. Transitioning from HCFCs to HFCs is meaningless in the long run since HFCs have a high global warming index whereas hydrocarbons like propane are very low on the index.\u000a\u000aWhile HFC technology has patent issues, which are not resolved, for instance only one company has the patent for HFC 32, hydrocarbon technology does not have patents and it can be developed commercially, Mr. Rajadhyaksha pointed out.\u000a\u000aResistance to hydrocarbons\u000a\u000aAccording to Jitendra Bhambure, Executive Vice-President, R&D and Technology, Blue Star limited, representing the Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Manufacturers Association (RAMA), HFCs were adopted by the developing countries and these refrigerants have higher global warming potential.\u000a\u000aThe Indian industry has started adopting HFCs as a part of phasing out HCFCs as per the Montreal Protocol, he added. However, he said while RAMA understands the need to address the issue of global warming, with no clear alternatives available it is difficult to work out a plan. Alternatives like HFO for air-conditioning application are under development but the timelines are not known, and they are classified as flammable. The technology is yet to be proven and commercial viability in not known. There will be intellectual property rights issues.\u000a\u000aMr. Bhambure said that hydrocarbons are classified as explosive and have a limitation on charge quantity, which makes them adaptable up to one ton. They cannot be adopted for higher tonnage systems. In India, 75 per cent of systems are 1.5 ton and above and thus hydrocarbons have limited scope. Flammability will be a big issue across the value chain from R&D to manufacturing, transportation, storage and in installation and service as the split systems are not sealed systems.\u000a\u000aThe most difficult will be the handling of flammable refrigerants by inadequately trained technicians across the country both in urban and rural areas.\u000a\u000aHe added that RAMA feels that it is not possible for the Indian air-conditioning and refrigeration industry to have any mandatory regulations unless there are alternatives available, which are technically proven, commercially viable, safe to use and matured as a technology.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental groups oppose India\u2019s stand\u000a\u000aMr. Bhushan says, \u201cOur policy seems to be dictated by the US and the industry, which holds the patents.\u201d He said why can\u2019t the Indian industry make a one-time move from HCFC directly to hydrocarbons, which is economically sound and 20 per cent more energy efficient and does not have a high global warming potential. It is in India\u2019s advantage to have its own technology. He said the industry says hydrocarbons are flammable but there is proof that companies are capable of overcoming this with safeguards.

Mousuni, one of the 52 inhabited islands of the archipelago, and a vulnerable climate change hotspot, is sinking at a rapid pace.\u000a\u000aThe island with a population of over 20,000 lies in the estuarine system and is open to the sea, said Tuhin Ghosh of the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University. \u201cAs the sea level continues to rise, flooding will become a regular phenomenon,\u201d Dr Ghosh said.\u000a\u000aThe 24-sq km island is the second most vulnerable island of the Sunderbans, next to Ghoramara island, whose population is about 5,000.\u000a\u000aThe panchayat pradhan claimed that damage to the island and the impact on the people is far more than it was during super cyclone Aila, which hit the Sunderbans in May 2009. \u201cThe embankments here have not been repaired since they were breached by Aila. About nine km of embankments has to repaired to prevent seawater flooding. The western part of the island is vulnerable to tides and regular flooding occurs, but this time the situation is grave,\u201d said Ilias. He said the State government had provided foodgrains, but supply is not proportionate to the number of people affected. A UNDP report published in 2010 said that 15 per cent of the delta will be submerged by 2020.

VScientists, including one of Indian-origin, have synthesised a catalyst that can help convert waste carbon dioxide into syngas, a precursor of gasoline and other energy-rich products.\u000a\u000aAmin Salehi-Khojin, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and his coworkers developed a unique two-step catalytic process that uses molybdenum disulfide and an ionic liquid to "reduce," or transfer electrons, to carbon dioxide in a chemical reaction.\u000a\u000aThe new catalyst improves efficiency and lowers cost by replacing expensive metals like gold or silver in the reduction reaction.\u000a\u000aThe discovery is a big step toward industrialisation, said Mohammad Asadi, UIC graduate student and co-first author on the paper.\u000a\u000a"With this catalyst, we can directly reduce carbon dioxide to syngas without the need for a secondary, expensive gasification process," he said.\u000a\u000aIn other chemical-reduction systems, the only reaction product is carbon monoxide. The new catalyst produces syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide plus hydrogen.\u000a\u000aThe high density of loosely bound, energetic d-electrons in molybdenum disulfide facilitates charge transfer, driving the reduction of the carbon dioxide, said Salehi-Khojin, principal investigator on the study.\u000a\u000a"This is a very generous material. We are able to produce a very stable reaction that can go on for hours," he said.\u000a\u000a"In comparison with other two-dimensional materials like graphene, there is no need to play with the chemistry of molybdenum disulfide, or insert any host materials to get catalytic activity," said Bijandra Kumar, UIC post-doctoral fellow and co-first author of the paper.\u000a\u000a"In noble metal catalysts like silver and gold, catalytic activity is determined by the crystal structure of the metal, but with molybdeneum disulfide, the catalytic activity is on the edges," said graduate student Amirhossein Behranginia, a coauthor on the paper.\u000a\u000a"Fine-tuning of the edge structures is relatively simple. We can easily grow the molybdenum disulfide with the edges vertically aligned to offer better catalytic performance," said Behranginia.\u000a\u000aThe proportion of carbon monoxide to hydrogen in the syngas produced in the reaction can also be easily manipulated using the new catalyst, said Salehi-Khojin.\u000a\u000a"Our whole purpose is to move from laboratory experiments to real-world applications," he said.\u000a\u000a"This is a real breakthrough that can take a waste gas - carbon dioxide - and use inexpensive catalysts to produce another source of energy at large-scale, while making a healthier environment," said Salehi-Khojin.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

VUS researchers have measured swells of more than 16 feet in once frozen region of Arctic Ocean that have the potential to break up ice even faster, threatening an "ice-free summer" that could have potentially wide-ranging implications.\u000a\u000aResearchers measured the massive swells in the Arctic's Beaufort Sea, just north of Alaska, The Post reported today.\u000a\u000aSwells of that size, researchers say, have the potential to break up Arctic ice even faster than than the melt underway there for decades thanks to rapid global warming.\u000a\u000aThe wave measurements, using sensors beneath the surface communicating via satellite, were recorded by Jim Thomson of the and W. Erick Rogers of the Naval Research Laboratory in 2012 and reported in an article in Geophysical Research Letters this year.\u000a\u000a"The observations reported here are the only known wave measurements in the central Beaufort Sea," they wrote, "because until recently the region remained ice covered throughout the summer and there were no waves to measure."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSixteen feet was the average during a peak period, Thomson said. "The largest single wave was probably" 9 meters, or about 29 feet, he said. The average over the entire 2012 season was 3 to 6 feet.\u000a\u000aThe distances of open water change "dramatically throughout the summer season, from essentially zero in April to well over 1000 km in September," they reported. "In recent years, the seasonal ice retreat has expanded dramatically, leaving much of the Beaufort Sea ice free at the end of the summer."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBecause swells carry more energy, they reported, they will likely increase the pace of ice breakup in the region, eventually producing an "ice-free summer, a remarkable departure from from historical conditions in the Arctic, with potentially wide-ranging implications for the air-water-ice system and the humans attempting to operate there.""Waves could accelerate the ice retreat," Thomson said in his email from a village on the Arctic, where he was getting read to deploy some wave buoys.\u000a\u000a"We don't have much direct evidence of this, or knowledge of the relative importance compared with melting, but the process is real. We are conducting a large project this summer to answer just that question," he said.

VNEW DELHI: Environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday said clean energy was the 'mantra' of his government and promised to utilize money from the National Clean Energy Fund to promote solar and wind power in a big way.Underlining the seriousness of this goal, he cited his government's decision to enlarge the corpus of the clean energy fund by levying more cess on coal.The government in its budget for the current year had announced an increase in the cess on coal from Rs 50 per tonne to Rs 100 per tonne.The National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF), which is capitalized by imposing cess on coal, peat and lignite, currently has over Rs 3,000 crore. Though the government has also decided to use this money to fund its clean Ganga mission, the bigger chunk of the money would be spent on its original mandate of promoting renewable energy.Javadekar made these remarks after releasing a report on \u2018solar air conditioning and desalination in India', brought out by WWF-India and the policy research institution Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The report, highlighting huge potential for the use of solar energy , made a strong case for using 'solar air conditioning'. It said, "With growing urbanization and demand for cooling, renewable energy application like solar air conditioning can play a significant roe in reducing peak-load demand on the electrical grid, especially during the day time."Touching upon the critical area of cost, the report said that despite the higher initial investment cost, maintenance and operation cost of a solar air conditioning system is "fairly economical when compared to conventional cooling system".It, however, admitted that the true market cost for solar air conditioning systems are difficult to assess, both at the global as well as national levels. It said, "This is particularly because solar air conditioning technology is still evolving and only limited installations have been executed."Noting the potential of solar energy, the report said most parts of India had between 300 and 330 sunny days in a year (equivalent to over 5,000 trillion kWh per year of energy), which can be harnessed through heat and electricity.Javadekar also conferred the 'Climate Solver Awards', which seek to encourage cutting edge clean (non-polluting) technologies. The awards, instituted by WWF-India, are an attempt to catalyze an enabling environment for climate innovations that promote energy access and reduce climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions.The report came at a time when Washington-based independent research organization Worldwatch Institute, in its latest findings, noted that solar power installations have jumped to a "new annual record" in 2013.Examining global trends in solar power, the institute said, \u201cThe year 2013 saw record-breaking growth for solar electricity generation as the photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) markets continued to grow. With over 39 giga-watts installed worldwide, the PV solar market represented one third of all newly-added renewable energy capacity."Europe accounted for the majority of global solar power consumption (67%), followed by Asia (23.9%) and North America (8.1%). Worldwide, solar consumption equaled 0.5% of electricity generation from all sources."

VNEW YORK: Ants may be cooling the Earth by helping trap carbon dioxide from the environment, a new study has claimed.\u000a\u000aA long-term experiment tracking the ants' effects on soil suggests they cooled Earth's climate as their numbers grew."Ants are changing the environment," said lead study author Ronald Dorn, from the Arizona State University in Tempe.Certain ant species "weather" minerals in order to secrete calcium carbonate \u2014 better known as limestone. The process traps and removes a tiny bit of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere, Dorn said.This ant limestone factory is a small-scale version of the massive planetary-cooling process that takes place in the oceans, known as carbon sequestration, 'Live Science' reported.Dorn discovered that ants were powerful weathering agents by tracking the breakdown of basalt sand.His experiment shows that ants appear to break down the minerals 50 to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed on bare ground.According to Dorn, the ants may be scavenging calcium and magnesium from the minerals and using these elements to make limestone.In the process, the insects may trap carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the rock, the report said.The transformation could take place when ants lick sand grains and stick them on the walls of their nests, but Dorn said the process is truly a scientific mystery.The study was published in the journal Geology.

VEven a year after the devastation in Uttarakhand, the state is yet to put in place a foolproof all weather communication system with last mile connectivity. File picture shows a flooded river in Uttarakashi district.\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aIn June 2013, a simple flood early warning system saved many villagers and their livestock on the banks of Jiadal river in Lakhimpur, Assam. But one year after the devastation in Uttarakhand, the state is yet to put in place a foolproof all weather communication system with last mile connectivity.\u000a\u000aMr. Anand Sharma, director, Meteorological Centre, Dehra Dun, said last June, he had issued accurate warnings 72 hours in advance to the authorities and also an advisory that pilgrims should not move ahead on the Char Dham yatra. However, it was important to communicate flood warning and evacuation messages to people promptly, he said while interacting with journalists at a media workshop on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Indian Himalayas organized by The Third Pole and Centre for Environment Education (CEE).\u000a\u000aMr. Sharma said his department was accused of not giving timely warning but from June 13, 2013 onwards, the Meteorological Centre had issued weather forecasts and warnings from time to time. Despite having advance information last year, it could not be communicated to yatris stuck in the Kedarnath valley. He said the communication system has to be foolproof and it has to use traditional and modern methods.\u000a\u000aEven a hand cranked radio which doesn\u2019t require batteries to operate was a good option. Radio is low cost and still the number one communicator in the world and there should be a better network in Uttarakhand.\u000a\u000aWhile the system for weather forecasting was in place, he said there was approval for three Doppler radars but that was more useful for flash floods and forecasts a few hours in advance. This year weather advisory was sent through SMS and in some places villagers used loudspeakers.\u000a\u000aLast year, there was specific and localized advice to yatris from June 13 onwards, Mr Sharma explained and they were told to postpone their pilgrimage by four days. The weather forecast and warning issued on June 14, 2013, through the agro-advisory bulletin indicated heavy rain in all the agro meteorological zones. He said he had also alerted the executive director, Disaster Management and Mitigation Centre, Mr. Piush Rautela over phone on June 14 about heavy rains in the coming days. The same day, the Inspector General Police (Intelligence) was informed about heavy to very heavy rain and landslides in the next 48 to 72 hours, who in turn informed the chief minister and chief secretary. Even the Inspector General, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) was told about the likelihood of heavy to very heavy rain and landslides on June 15.\u000a\u000aThe major landslides occurred from the night of June 16 onwards and major damage took place on June 17, Mr. Sharma said. Despite advance information, communication was poor and the tragedy was not averted. And lessons are not learnt from it either.\u000a\u000aVillagers in Assam, meanwhile, could save Rs 1.5 lakh worth of livestock thanks to the early warning system last year. The device which consists of a pole with a sensor is placed in the river and it has wireless connectivity to a warning system which beeps if the water levels rise above the danger mark. And it\u2019s relatively cheap, at Rs 20,000, said Nand Kishor Agrawal, programme coordinator, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) who installed eight such devices in the river.

VNEW DELHI: At a time when India's "right to grow" pitch caused concern among environmentalists sceptical about New Delhi's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's "zero defect and zero effect" remark on Friday came as a clear message that the country would not compromise on its goal of environmental protection.\u000a\u000aAsking small and big industrialists and youth not to compromise on quality of products and environment, Modi said, "Don't compromise on two points \u2013 first zero defect and second zero effect"."Let's think about making our product which has 'zero defect' so that it does not come back (get rejected) from the world market and 'zero effect' so that the manufacturing does not have an adverse effect on our environment", said the Prime Minister while delivering his maiden Independence Day speech.Whle exhorting industry to make India the manufacturing hub of the world, Modi said, "I am confident that we would achieve our goals if we carry our dream of manufacturing sector with zero defect and zero effect".His categorical remark gives a clear message that the country will move on its low-carbon and sustainable growth trajectory while adopting clean technology and renewable energy in a big way.It also assumes significance ahead of the New York climate summit which is being organized by the United Nations (UN) on September 23 to give a political momentum to the climate change negotiations before coming out with a global climate deal in Paris next year.Reacting to Modi's remark, UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chief, R K Pachauri said, "It has been quite clear right from the beginning that the Prime Minister is very much concerned about climate change. The remark shows his commitment to achieve the twin goals of development and environmental protection. Even his remark and overemphasis on cleanliness has direct bearing on environment".Asked how the country would go for this amid varied challenges on different fronts, Pachauri told the TOI that India would do this by making it a "people's movement". He said, "Government alone cannot do this. It should be a people's movement. We have to tell the people that both development and environment protection can go together if we adopt the right approach".Giving an example of air pollution and its effect on human health, the IPCC chairman said, "People would surely understand it if we tell them about the co-benefits of various measures to protect environment".

VGURGAON: It could soon be mandatory in Gurgaon to install rooftop solar panels in all new homes, housing societies and commercial buildings.Convinced that a long-term solution to the city's power crisis lies in the obligatory use of renewable energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) is planning to make changes in its rulebook and link the installation of solar panels to building plan approvals. This means once the proposal is cleared, no new house or office building in the city will get civic clearance if the rooftop solar panel is not a part of the layout plan. The MCG plans to eventually extend this rule to all buildings in the city. But the immediate focus is only on new buildings, though a final decision is yet to be taken.A senior official in the MCG's engineering department said, "The power crisis in the city is going from bad to worse with each passing year and there is no relief in sight. This is the primary reason why we are planning to make it mandatory for building owners to install these solar panels so that they can themselves produce power and use it instead of having to depend on other non-renewable sources of electricity. If they don't agree to do so, we will not approve their plan. This is the only way we can push residents to go for renewable energy."The MCG is also planning to incentivize new house or building-owners by providing tax rebates as solar rooftop panels don't come cheap. At the lower end, a panel with a capacity between 3.5kW and 4.5kW that can power a 1BHK home costs about Rs 4 lakh. Home-owners, officials said, would be given a 5%-10% annual rebate on property tax for installing these panels. "Another way to promote this plan is to give rebates to those who have already installed such systems or do so of their own will," the engineering department official said.The MCG, the official added, was in talks with the ministry of renewable energy to finalize the plan.While the civic body works out the quantum of solar power generation it intends to make compulsory in proportion with the size of a house or a plot, sources the rollout would happen with commercial buildings. "Commercial buildings will come under this clause initially as they are the ones that consume maximum power and some of them also operate 24X7."

For the present fiscal, annual capacity target has been lowered to 3,770 MW from 4,325 MW set for the previous year.\u000a\u000aOf the 722 MW, wind sector contributed about 561 MW (608 MW), while the rest was contributed by solar, bagasse, co-generation and small hydro at 106 MW (153 MW), 32 MW (nil) and 22.5 MW (74.5 MW), respectively, according to Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).\u000a\u000aThe cumulative grid-interactive renewable energy installed capacity stood at 32,424 MW on July 31, 2014.\u000a\u000aPresently, wind makes up 67 per cent of India\u2019s total green power installed capacity. Of the total capacity of 32.4 GW, wind sector contributed 21.7 GW, followed by small hydro power at 3.8 GW, solar at 2.7 GW, bagasse cogeneration power at 2.7 GW, biomass at 1.4 GW, and waste energy at 107 GW.\u000a\u000aIt may be noted that the Union Finance Ministry has not acted upon the recommendations by the Union Ministry of Commerce for levying anti-dumping duties on import of solar cells and modules.\u000a\u000aAs no official communication was issued by the Finance Ministry, the deadline of August 22 for deciding on duties had gone by.\u000a\u000aPiyush Goyal, Union Minister of State of Power, Coal & MNRE, in the meanwhile, has assured solar manufacturers that whatever capacities are available for domestic cell and modules in the country, adequate market would be made available so that they can not only run to full capacity but also ramp up the production.

VThe US and some countries in the European Union (EU) have put pressure on the to disassociate from the powerful Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) Group, which negotiates at the UN talks along with India and China against the developed countries.\u000a\u000aBusiness Standard reviewed exchanges between members expressing concern about the pressure on the to move out of the group, which has over three years become one of the most powerful developing country blocs at the negotiating table.\u000a\u000aThe pressure on the comes at a time when the world is required to stitch a new climate pact by 2015. The developed world is keen to reinterpret the provisions of the convention but many developing countries, including India, keep pointing out that everyone agreed to the new pact being crafted under the existing UN climate convention. The Philippines had become one of the leading voices of this group with China and India, having successfully taken on the US and the EU on occasions.\u000a\u000aIn the last meeting of the UN at Warsaw in 2013, the Philippines, yet to recover from the Haiyan typhoon, took the lead as the moral voice of those vulnerable to It was one of the countries that dramatically forced the US, EU and other rich countries to assessing who should pay the poor countries\u2019 costs of loss and damage caused from inaction over A US cable to its diplomatic outposts, leaked during the Warsaw meeting, had revealed its strong opposition to such loss and damage discussions, asking its diplomats to lobby hard against such a move in the run-up to the talks.\u000a\u000aIndia and China joined the battle at Warsaw in ensuring the principle of equity was not morphed to erase the responsibilities of developed countries. The support from the group helped both save the day.\u000a\u000aAt the Warsaw meeting, the Philippines stole some thunder from the small island countries, portrayed as the voice of the vulnerable but those who work in an alliance the EU has stitched. The Philippines negotiator, Naderev M Sano, known as Yeb Sano, became an iconic figure with the global civil society rallying round him as he broke down at the talks and vowed a fast till the negotiations produced results. The Philippines also has war horse Berneditas Muller, experienced and with deep knowledge of the convention, its decisions over the decades and their legal interpretation.\u000a\u000aThe has India, China, Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Nicaragua and Saudi Arabia, and a dozen others. At the recent round of talks in Bonn (Germany), the LMDC had presented the first formal base paper for the 2015 pact. The US and the EU had objected to its contents.\u000a\u000aA retired Indian negotiator aware of the episode said, \u201cThis is a typical divide-and-rule tactic and an attempt to isolate India and China. It was tried before, too, with developing countries. Such diplomatic arm-twisting for short-term gains will further reduce trust between key countries that is necessary to have a successful Paris pact.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe US special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern, did not reply to emails from Business Standard. EU Climate Change Commissioner Connie Hedegaard\u2019s office said, \u201cIt is not for the Commission to comment on the role of the Philippines in the negotiations.\u201d At the last round of climate talks, the EU Commissioner had run into a verbal duel with the LMDC over how the principle of equity was being interpreted.\u000a\u000aThe office of the Philippines Commission on Climate Change did not respond to queries.\u000a\u000aSeveral negotiators from the countries in the LMDC, including one from India, confirmed the news and the discussions in the group to Business Standard. A negotiator said, \u201cWhat you have gathered from our other friends (in the LMDC) is quite accurate. This is a grand scheme to marginalise the voices that matter. \u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother wrote, \u201cAt the last round of negotiations in Bonn in June we did discuss this. The Philippines occupies an important place and it is unfortunate some countries are using their heft against it.\u201dA third from an economically powerful member of the group said it was unclear if the roles of and Bernedittas, too, would be reduced in delegations.\u000a\u000aIt is not the first time that diplomatic arm-twisting and allurements have been used in the climate negotiations besides spying. The Wikileak cables disclosed how US and the EU tried to wield their financial influence over small countries such as Maldives and the small island states. The EU did stitch together an alliance with AOSIS and the against India and China. But this alliance weakened last year with the EU dragging its feet on climate finance commitments and the loss and damage track of negotiations. This lead to relatively greater unity in the G77 group of countries at Warsaw in 2013 even as the LMDC group led strongly.

VAn expert group on ' for inclusive growth' headed by former member Kirit Parikh, has recommended that cess be levied on all fossil fuels, to enable a low carbon-dependent society. The report argues the need to levy a tax similar to and use it for development of energy-efficient ways to generate power.\u000a\u000aThe report, has been given to the In Union Budget 2014, the government increased the from Rs 50 a tonne to Rs 100 a tonne.\u000a\u000aThe group, which has experts from coal, power, oil & gas, renewable energy, environment and transport sectors, has compiled some key alternative low-carbon options, with an analysis of their cost-benefits and the enabling legislations required to operationalise the same.\u000a\u000aThe committee has suggested five policy instruments - energy pricing, carbon tax, cap & trade, subsidy, and regulation. Under these heads, the report has suggested measures such as market pricing of fuel, an appropriate structure for power sale, energy-efficiency standards, and purchase obligation on customers for demand-side management.\u000a\u000a"The Expert Group recommends that we should, in the first instance, move as soon as possible to a domestically competitive market for fossil fuels and transfer targeted subsidies directly to the poor, through the best means available. This has been accepted, in principle, by the government. The movement towards market pricing, however, is slow, and the process needs to be accelerated without any further loss of time," the report notes.\u000a\u000aThis recommendation is in line with the suggestions made by the Vijay Kelkar committee looking into gas pricing, advocating market-determined pricing, with rates being fixed at the highest possible level.\u000a\u000aLooking at the long-term viability of the power prices, the report favours a feed in tariff (FiT) model for the power sector, especially renewable energy. "FiT gives certainty to the plant owner whose cash inflows are predictable. This makes it easier to obtain finance and attain financial closure," says the report.\u000a\u000aFor demand-side management, the report suggests measures such as strict renewable purchase obligation, consumer awareness in energy use, and efficiency standards for the industry.

Of course they, and the rest of the world, want migration of populations out of the islands to be kept at a minimum."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFigueres said the situation facing island nations underlined the need for progress in the quest to seal a global pact on greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2015.\u000a\u000aThe UN wants to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels, which scientists say is the minimum needed to stabilise the climate.\u000a\u000a"The science tells us that we have to stay under two degrees temperature-wise and that the door is closing quickly," she said.

VNEW DELHI: India is expected to stick to its tough stand on climate negotiation and make no new announcement at the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s climate summit in New York this month, which UN officials said would be a major turning point in the global approach to the issue.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe summit, which will bring together 125 heads of state and government including US President Barack Obama, as well as business and civil society, has been slated as the big event to mobilise political will towards finalising the new global compact to tackle climate change. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending the summit, he would address the UN General Assembly four days later.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNew Delhi is clear that the summit cannot become a forum to take decisions or make announcements as that would impact the ongoing negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe UN itself has emphasised that the summit is not a negotiating session but an effort to put the issue \u201cback on top of the international agenda\u201d. Selwin Hart, director of the UN Secretary General\u2019s climate team told reporters this week that the summit \u201cwill be a major turning point in the way the world is approaching climate change,\u201d and would give leaders the opportunity to make key announcements and share steps their countries have taken to address climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOfficials said Modi\u2019s decision not to participate reflects the environment ministry\u2019s advice to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on the desirability of an Indian participation at the highest levels of government. A senior official told ET on the conditions of anonymity that while several factors contributed to the prime minister\u2019s decision, the environment ministry had in its input stressed that UN Secretary General\u2019s initiative was not \u201cimportant\u201d as it was not part of the negotiations and that the Prime Minister \u201cshould not attend the meet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was felt that Prime Minister Modi\u2019s presence at what would be his first high profile UN engagement would put the pressure on India to make some new announcement on its efforts to deal with climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Indian stance on UN Climate Summit is in line with that of China \u2014 President Xi Jinping will not be attending the Summit either.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia and China\u2019s approach to the summit is reflective of the position taken by the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group in climate negotiations. The LMDC is a group of developing countries which besides India and China includes Venezuela, Philippines, Bolivia, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe LMDC maintains that the UN Climate Summit is not the forum to make any announcements on efforts to tackle climate change as it would prejudice ongoing climate change negotiations. There is a widespread feeling that the developed countries would like the UN Secretary General\u2019s initiative to be used to address and unlock contentious issues that have resulted in a logjam in the climate negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VKOLKATA: When \u2018birthday boy\u2019 Narendra Modi plays host to Chinese President Xi Jinping at a private dinner on the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, the leaders of the two burgeoning economic powers will witness the signing of several agreements.Among the most urgent challenges that the Prime Minister faces is putting India\u2019s economic growth back on the track.Modi, who turns 64 on Wednesday, may well seek an insight into the Chinese success story but many will be hoping he also learns from their environmental lessons.If concerns over the impact of economic growth on environment had been simmering on the backburner for decades, climatic changes and the recent natural catastrophes have brought it to the fore.Dr William Antholis of the Brookings Institution , a Washington DC-based think tank, feels India can take a leaf out of the American effort, even as next week\u2019s UN Climate Summit will surely seek solid assurances from both.\u201cIt\u2019s about how effectively he can delink domestic actions from the global actions while using the UN conference to demonstrate that he is a self-confident leader,\u201d Antholis said at an interactive session jointly organized by the US Consulate General and the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Monday.\u201cIn previous conferences, India, like the United States, appeared scared of the UN system. The US needs to be really embarrassed about that because we\u2019ve been the single biggest contributor to climate change,\u201d he added, pointing out how the government has tried to rectify all that with domestic action.\u201cIn the first two years of the Obama reign $90 billion were earmarked for the development of clean energy; car emission standards are getting stricter and we should be able to get 50 miles to the gallon by 2035. Then there is this monitoring of power plant emissions. What Modi needs is to figure out what kind of action he needs to perform without jeopardizing the economic aspirations of India,\u201d Antholis said.Antholis, who spent nine-week stretches in each of the two countries a couple of years ago, sees snatches of the China experience in the Indian economic growth and feels that Modi\u2019s work to encourage state effort in the growth is crucial.\u201cEach state, each city needs to be a contributor to the effort of controlling and reducing its carbon footprints,\u201d he said, stressing on decentralization for more impact.

Though there is no sovereign guarantee that comes with the loan but it would be extended to anyone who wants to set up a renewable energy-based power project with equipment sourcing from the US."The country aims to add about 4,500 Mw of solar power capacity during the current financial year to the existing capacity of 2,600 Mw. The manufacturing capacity of solar panels in the country, however, is just 1,500 Mw. To invite global players to the country, the ministry of new and renewable energy would also host the first-ever renewable energy global investment promotion meet in February next year. This goes well with the mega 'Make in India' plan of the government to boost manufacturing in the country.\u000a\u000aWhile wind turbines in the country are mostly domestically sourced, 70 per cent of its solar capacity is based on imported content, mostly from China and the US.

VJAIPUR: The arid regions of Rajasthan are the worst sufferer of climatic changes, according to Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur. Eleven districts in this zone have seen a rise in surface heating, reduction in rainfall, change in crop pattern and low milk productivity of livestock. The inference emerged after CAZRI analyzed climatic data of this region from 1913 to 2013. The latest data received from remote sensing says that rainfall is likely to decline gradually by 20% to 30% in the arid region.The arid region comprises Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Pali, Jalore, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Bikaner, Churu, Sri Ganganagar and Hunumangarh. The report prepared by the scientists of CAZRI pointed out that unusual heating of the surface has been happening since the mid 80s. "The annual temperature has risen by 2-3 degree Celsius and it is estimated that in the few decades, this figure will be around 5 degree Celsius. It will drastically affect food, fodder, water and livelihood of people of this region," SPS Tanwar, head department of Agronomy, CAZRI, said.In fact, in the past 100 years, the region has witnessed three severe droughts, in 1989, 2002 and 2009. This year too, six of these districts are facing a drought-like situation. "The rainfall was negligible in the month of august and September. This has resulted in depletion of the ground water table to an extent where salinity in the water has increased manifold, making it unfit for drinking especially in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Pali," saidThe study further says that over the years, 20-40% loss of yield loss was recorded in Mustard and other rabi crops. The impact on the soil cover has reduced the green pastures, the effects of which are now noticeable in livestock's body weight and milk. The agricultural output has also declined, putting an end to the sustainable productivity. In the study, CAZRI explains that the immediate need is to switch over to arid farming, introducing livestock production management, effective soil conservation measures and emphasis on harnessing renewable energy resources.

VNEW DELHI: India and the United States have agreed to work together on efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change and improve climate resilience through better use of information and planning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama issued ajoint statement in Washington, DC on Tuesday, laying out the broad contours of a new partnership between India and the United States for climate resilience.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two leaders propose to identify opportunities to jointly advance capacity for strengthening climate resilience, including development of actionable information, data and tools to help national, state, and local officials with climate adaptation planning. They agreed to specify areas of partnership to improve India\u2019s renewable energy capabilities and production, thereby help contain the dependence on fossilfuels for energy generation and move to a low carbon growth path.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe focus on adaptation comes at a time when both countries have been dealing with extreme weather events like droughts in parts of the United States, and excessive rainfallin parts of India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe joint statement is a recognition of India\u2019s contention that development, energy access, and improving the living standards of its people is as much a priority as addressing climate change. The Export-Import Bank of the United States and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) have agreed to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MoU), to make available financing of up to $1 billion to support export of Made-in-America renewable energy goods and services for clean energy projects in India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe understanding between the two institutions includes establishing a framework for cooperation under the MoU to increase mutually beneficial business opportunities in support of India\u2019s energy initiatives, including the doubling of the upcoming phase of Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) to 3,000 MW. In a similar effort, the two governments have agreed to create a bilateral Clean Energy Finance Forum through which public and private sector officials from the two countries can explore specific opportunities to mobilise finance for clean energy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two countries have agreed to a new partnership on energy smart cities that will showcase the policies, technologies, and business and finance models needed to turn clean energy into a commercial opportunity that will draw in private capital and allow commercial scale-up to take off.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two governments have also agreed to a new multi-million dollar, multi-year effort, Greening the Grid, to ensure reliable delivery of clean energy through a stronger, more flexible power system.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe focus will be on enabling large-scale deployment of clean energy and energy efficiency, thereby improving India\u2019s capacity to absorb into its grid an increasing proportion of renewable energy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe US is also evaluating new activities that would help India reduce imports, become more efficient, and meet new international environmental standards for fuels.

The alternatives to HFCs, required for some sectors of the economy, are the proprietary technology of select US-based companies and entail high costs. Then some of the technologies are yet not tested for safety. Third, the US wanted to phase out the greenhouse gases under the instead of the UN convention on climate change, where higher costs of transition could be availed. Additionally, it would set a precedent of letting decisions being taken outside the UN climate convention, which India has long objected to.\u000a\u000aThe US was keen that India agrees right away to kick-starting decisions to deal with the refrigerant gases under the Montreal Protocol, which in diplomatic jargon is referred to as setting up a "contact group" on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe government officials involved in the negotiations had suggested against such a move at present. "Strategically it made sense to negotiate this as part of the entire package under the UN climate convention for the 2015 global deal," a senior official explained. "But it was decided at the highest levels to do so otherwise, I guess," he added.\u000a\u000aAnother source told Business Standard the high pressure from the US ensured that the issue was resolved at the highest level in the government, with the Cabinet only approving the agreement between the two countries "in principle", leaving the final call to the prime minister's office.\u000a\u000aThe final statement that emerged from the meeting of the two heads of government at Washington said the two countries, "recognised the need to use the institutions and expertise of the to reduce consumption and production of HFCs, while continuing to report and account for the quantities reduced under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt added, "They (India and US) pledged to urgently arrange a meeting of their bilateral task force on prior to the next meeting of the to discuss issues such as safety, cost, and commercial access to new or alternative technologies to replace "\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis language did not have India committing all the way to set up a 'contact group', as the US desired, but it did break India away from its existing redlines to move a step closer towards eventual agreement.\u000a\u000a"The critical final step could be taken by India nearer to the Montreal Protocol meeting in November. The government would be required to change its existing non-negotiable redlines to accept that the issue can be dealt with outside the UN climate convention," one of the two senior officials Business Standard spoke to explained.

VFracking technology has driven a boom in natural gas that many hope will prompt a switch away from coal use and put the brakes on the rise in Earth-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\u000a\u000aBut a study today said market forces will undo many of the potential benefits from this burgeoning energy source.\u000a\u000aEver-cheaper prices will prompt higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions, and discourage investment in lower-emitting alternatives like nuclear, wind and solar, it said.\u000a\u000a"The upshot is that abundant natural gas alone will not rescue us from climate change," said Haewon McJeon of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a US government energy research body.\u000a\u000aAdvances in hydraulic fracturing -- pumping liquids into stone to break it up and release the gas within -- and horizontal drilling, have unlocked plentiful natural gas supplies, mainly in the United States to date.\u000a\u000a"Global deployment of advanced natural gas production technology could double or triple the global natural gas production by 2050," said McJeon.\u000a\u000aThis could lead to CO2 emissions up to 10 percent higher by the middle of the century, instead of lowering them.\u000a\u000a"The additional gas supply boosts its deployment, but the substitution of coal is rather limited and it might also substitute low-emission renewables and nuclear," co-author Nico Bauer of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"The high hopes that natural gas will help reduce global warming because of technical superiority to coal turn out to be misguided because market effects are dominating.\u000a\u000a"The main factor here is that an abundance of natural gas leads to a price drop and expansion of total primary energy supply."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIncreased gas production also led to higher emissions of another potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas, methane, due to leakages from drilling and pipelines.

About 200 Indian companies participated in the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn terms of global ranking, it is impressive that five Indian companies have made it to the Global A-list, on par with Australia and Canada and more than any other emerging economy, except South Africa,\u201d said a statement issued by CDR India.\u000a\u000aA similar report for India showed that energy efficiency was a key mean for the companies to check their carbon emissions. Over 60% of the surveyed companies are introducing process energy efficiency initiatives, consequently 24% have reduced their absolute emissions and an additional 26% have reduced their emissions intensity while driving business growth and profitability.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe report demonstrates a strong level of commitment by Indian companies towards greater energy efficiency as a means of addressing climate change. It also highlights the need for enabling a strong regulatory environment that attract higher levels of investments,\u201d said Damandeep Singh, director, CDP India.

VThe glaciers in the Himalayas will continue to retreat for another 40-50 years and if this phenomenon is not checked, temperature will rise by at least four degrees Celsius by the end of this century.\u000a\u000aThis caution has been issued by Anil Kulkarni, a scientist with the Bangalore-based Indian Institute of Science, at a conference on Himalayan glaciology here Thursday.\u000a\u000a"But everything is still not lost. It can be checked by policy interventions. The consistent receding of glaciers will be a big threat to the food security," he said.\u000a\u000aKulkarni said it was wrong to presume that all the glaciers will disappear by 2035. "The earlier studies which established this fact were not scientific."\u000a\u000a"Seventy percent of water from the melting glaciers flows down to Pakistan and about 90 percent of the irrigation is done with this water."\u000a\u000a"A small window of opportunity is still available to India and the world to save the situation (glacier receding). If we keep the level of glaciers to what existed in 1980s, it can possibly lead to their conservation," the scientist said.\u000a\u000aHe said, "It's a known phenomenon that the temperatures are rising and the precipitation is increasing. It needs to be studied how it would affect the availability of water in times to come."\u000a\u000aThe Himalayas are home to 10,000 glaciers, covering about 40,000 sq km area.\u000a\u000a"Most of the glaciers are consistently receding but we have no idea about two places in India -- Karakoram and Arunachal Pradesh. Scientists and policy makers should sit together and look for solutions."\u000a\u000aStudies conducted by Kulkarni said the formation of lakes with melting of glaciers is a new phenomenon and it is to be seen seriously.\u000a\u000a"In the Himalayan region, 500 new lakes have been formed due to glacial melting."\u000a\u000aWater management was the biggest challenge posed by melting of glaciers, said Tarun Shridhar, principal secretary of Himachal Pradesh's science and technology department.\u000a\u000a"The Himalayan region is the most wasteful region compared to other parts of the globe when it comes to tapping water for future usage," he said.\u000a\u000a"The government is watchful of the situation but the scientists need to tell the policy makers in simple terms what needs to be done to check consistent retreat of the glaciers," Shridhar said.\u000a\u000aHe said scientists should give evidence-based reports to the planners for intervention rather than just taking alarmist view.\u000a\u000aThe Himachal Pradesh Centre on Climate Change has been undertaking studies pertaining to the climate-induced hazard threats by monitoring the moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the high-altitude hills.\u000a\u000aMoraine is a mass of rocks and sediment carried down and deposited by a glacier, which then blocks the glacier and creates a lake.

VMUMBAI: Moving to a low-carbon energy economy, the country can free up a whopping USD 600 billion for investments for various developmental projects over the next two decades leading to overall development, says a report by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI).As the country is trying to meet ambitious renewable energy goals as well as development needs with finite financial resources, moving to a low-carbon economy can help it maximise its financial capacity to meet economic and development goals, which will result in a saving of USD 600 billion for more productive investments, says CPI.The Climate Policy Initiative is a global policy effectiveness analysis and advisory organisation with a mission to assess, diagnose, and support nations' efforts to achieve low-carbon growth.An independent, not-for-profit organisation supported by a grant from the Open Society Foundations, CPI is headquartered in the US, and has offices and programmes in Brazil, China, Europe, India, and Indonesia. It uses the International Energy Agency's business-as-usual and two degree change assumptions to simulate current and low-carbon energy pathways.The country has set a target of 20 GW solar energy by 2020 under the national solar mission, while the target from the wind energy is three time more at 65.5 GW.The report further said transitioning to a low-carbon electricity system could also bring financial savings if the country can reduce the cost of finance. These savings, when coupled with a reduction in the high financing costs can provide the country with additional financial capacity to meet its economic and development goals.The CPI report warned that the government and banks should also be aware of future risks of fossil-fuel asset value losses. Of the potential new coal-fired power plants that are currently planned or under construction, 77 per cent are at risk of causing asset value loss, it said, adding that long-term, low-cost debt can reduce the cost of low-carbon power by 30 per cent in the country."Our analysis reveals that with the right policy choices, over the next 20 years India and the rest of the world can achieve the emissions reductions necessary for a safer, more stable climate and still free up billions of dollars for investment in development and other parts of the economy," said CPI senior director David Nelson.On China, the report said since it is the biggest polluter apart from being the biggest consumer of oil, a transition away from oil and with the right policies, can lead to a net benefit to the financial system of over USD 1 trillion.China, the US, Europe and India are the four largest polluters and the biggest consumers of fossil fuel . China and other net oil consuming countries together comprise three-fourths of global oil demand.Similarly the EU, which is also a net consumer of oil can lead to a net benefit to the financial system of over USD 1 trillion by adopting no-fossil fuel based technologies.On the US, the report said being a net consumer of oil, the US, with the right policies, can save more than USD 300 billion.The savings that the US will accrue is lesser than other economies as the large majority of its fossil fuel assets are privately owned with the governments, including municipal utilities, owning only around 20 per cent of the coal-fired power plants and little of oil, coal,or natural gas assets, CPI said.

VSHIMLA: In the past during winters, rivers in Himachal Pradesh used to witness very less discharge of water due to extreme cold freezing the glaciers from where rivers originate. But now, water discharge during winters has increased due to melting of glaciers and early melting of seasonal snow. While study has revealed that since 1962, the glacier area has reduced from 2,077 square km to 1,628 square km, another study has found that many small glaciers have already disappeared from the Himalayas.A paper "Effect of Global Warming on the Himalayan Cryosphere" by A V Kulkarni from Space Application Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, revealed that investigation of 466 glaciers in Chenab, Parbati and Baspa basins of Himachal Pradesh has shown overall de-glaciation of 21%. However, number of glaciers has increased due to fragmentation, it said.The paper states that average stream runoff of Baspa basin (in Kinnaur district) for December has increased by 75%. "This combination of glacial retreat, negative mass balance, early melting of seasonal snow cover and winter time increase in stream runoff suggest an influence of climate change on the Himalayan Cryosphere," it added.Another paper "Global Climate Change and Melting of Himalayan Glaciers" by Samjwal Ratna Bajracharya, Pradeep Kumar Mool, Basanta Raj Shrestha from International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Kathmandu, said that global mean temperature is expected to increase between 1.4 to 5.8C over the next 100 years. Consequences of this change in global climate are already being witnessed in the Himalayan glaciers and glacial lakes. The Himalayan glaciers are retreating at rates ranging from 10 to 60 metres per year and many small glaciers have already disappeared.A report prepared by State Centre on Climate Change , Himachal Pradesh, said that based on the recent observations on Himalayan glaciers, it is observed that most of them are retreating. "Monitoring of these glaciers would be helpful to assess future availability of Himalayan water resources," it stated.State Centre on Climate Change for the study had monitored the glaciers of Baspa and Spiti sub-catchment of Satluj river basin. On the basis of updated inventory of the glaciers in Baspa basin, a total of 30 glaciers could be mapped. Of these, 19 glaciers were selected to estimate glacier retreat."Investigation reveals that almost all glaciers are receding and an overall 19% deglaciation is observed from 1962 to 2001. Glacier located around 5,000m have shown 24% loss as compared to 14% for those located on the altitude higher than 5,400m, and the mean altitude of the glacier terminus is shifted upward by 88m that is from 4,482 to 4,570," said the report.

VClimate change is causing toxic metals trapped in the sediment beds of the Hooghly estuary in the Indian Sunderbans to leach out into the water system due to changes in ocean chemistry, say scientists, warning of potential human health hazards.\u000a\u000aThey predict that after about 30 years, increasing ocean acidification - another dark side of spiked atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide - could in fact unlock the entire stock of metals like copper and lead gathered in the sediment layer, and release them into the water system, leading to health issues.\u000a\u000aSunderbans is the world's largest mangrove forest and home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger. More than two-thirds of the forest lies in Bangladesh and the rest in West Bengal.\u000a\u000aOceans act as cleansers by taking up a chunk (around one-fourth) of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels shoot up, the levels absorbed by oceans increase, lowering their pH (indicator of acidity) and making them more acidic (ocean acidification).\u000a\u000aThrough the water, toxic metals are finding their way into the muscles and tissues of certain edible finfish, popular in the Indian Sunderbans area in West Bengal and because of the food chain, they pose a threat to human health as well, say researchers.\u000a\u000a"This ocean acidification is leading to release of the toxic, carcinogenic metals into the water. Our study based on 30 years of real-time data (from 1984 to 2013) forecasts a significant lowering of pH after a period of 30 years due to ocean acidification. This is an offshoot of climate change.\u000a\u000a"As a result, this will lead to the movement of entire biologically available copper and lead (but not zinc) from the underlying sediment compartment to the overlying aquatic phase," Abhijit Mitra, advisor, Oceanography, Techno India University (TIU) here, told IANS.\u000a\u000aExisting data shows global oceanic pH has decreased by 0.1 pH units (25 percent increase in acidity) since the onset of the industrial revolution and is projected to decrease by up to another 0.4 pH units by 2100.\u000a\u000aPublished in the Journal of Energy, Environment and Carbon Credits, it confirms the role of ocean acidification in the funnel shaped Hooghly estuary bordering the western fringes of Indian Sunderbans - the world's largest continuous mangrove forests.\u000a\u000aThe Unesco World Heritage Site is known for its exceptional biodiversity in flora and fauna with as many as 334 plant species and 693 species of wildlife which include 49 mammals, 59 reptiles, eight amphibians, 210 white fishes, 24 shrimps, 14 crabs and 43 mollusks species.\u000a\u000aThe selected study station lies 2.8 km off the Namkhana island, located almost at the confluence of the Bay of Bengal and the estuary.\u000a\u000aThe study was a collaborative effort between researchers TIU, Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Dhruba Chand Halder College, Barasat, Chanchal College, Malda and University Putra, Selangor, Malaysia.\u000a\u000aResearcher Sufia Zaman, who studied the bioaccumulation of the toxic metals in edible fish species such as Goldspot mullet (commonly called parshe), noted an aberration: though there was "no significant increase" in industrial activities in the area over the years, there was an "increasing trend" of toxic metals in the coastal water.\u000a\u000aThe explanation: ocean acidification causing the metals to leach out from the sediment bed.\u000a\u000a"The other sources are trawlers, which have lead paints on their underside, shrimp farms that release ammonia from the waste water and tourism activities," said Zaman, associated with TIU.\u000a\u000aMitra warned high levels of copper and lead could cause intestinal disorders and brain damage.\u000a\u000a"The forecast values of dissolved zinc, copper and lead will touch 698.98 ppb (parts per billion), 497.65 ppb and 76.60 ppb respectively after a period of 30 years," said Pardis Fazli of Malaysia's University Putra.\u000a\u000aOften referred to as another carbon dioxide problem besides global warming, ocean acidification is being implicated across the world for its impact on coral reef formation.\u000a\u000a"For Indian Sunderbans, the present forecast values strongly justify the consideration of acidification phenomenon in order to develop a sound management action plan in context to heavy metal pollution monitoring and control," said Prosenjit Pramanick of TIU.\u000a\u000a(Sahana Ghosh can be contacted at sahana.g@ians.in)

VA Sino-US breakthrough on curbing carbon emissions proves a global deal on climate change is achievable, U.S. President Barack Obama said Saturday, as campaigners hailed new vibrancy in long-stalled talks.\u000a\u000aAnnouncing a $3-billion contribution to a U.N.-backed climate change mitigation fund, the American leader said the China-U.S. deal unveiled earlier this week showed the way forward.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf China and the U.S. can agree on this, then the world can agree on this \u2014 we can get this done,\u201d he said in a speech on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brisbane.\u000a\u000aThe U.N. and green campaigners welcomed the funding pledge, saying it confirmed global warming was now central to the world\u2019s political agenda following the surprise deal between Washington and Beijing to reduce their greenhouse emissions.\u000a\u000aClimate experts conceded that Republican opposition may see Obama struggle to fulfil his $3 billion commitment, but said he was fuelling momentum for change in an area where talks have faltered since the historic Kyoto Protocol of 1997.\u000a\u000aObama outlined his pledge to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) at the University of Queensland, drawing applause when he told the audience he wanted to ensure his grandchildren could visit Australia\u2019s famed Great Barrier Reef \u201c50 years from now\u201d.\u000a\u000aHe said the fund would help developing nations cope with climate-related issues such as rising seas while also backing environmentally friendly infrastructure projects.\u000a\u000asaid.\u000a\u000aIt was the American leader's most upbeat assessment about climate change since he was elected in 2008 promising to tackle the issue, only to see it relegated amid partisan bickering and economic woes.\u000a\u000aHis stance stymied efforts by G20 host Tony Abbott \u2014 who questions the science of man-made global warming \u2014 to reduce the issue to the margins of the Brisbane summit and emphasise economic growth. \u2014 AFP

VNEW DELHI: Three days after entering into a joint climate deal with China to limit emission of greenhouse gases, the world\u2019s biggest \u2018historical\u2019 polluter, the US, on Saturday pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) \u2013 a financial support mechanism aimed at assisting poor countries to a low carbon resilient future \u2013 making the corpus of the Fund to nearly $6 billion.Though the amount is just a peanut as compared to the $100 billion a year promised by rich nations collectively to their poor counterparts from 2020 onwards, this is the largest signal pledge to date by any rich countries to the GCF. It may, therefore, be seen as a good beginning from the US side which had earlier been not so keen of its early capitalization.The US pledge for the Fund was announced by the President Barack Obama at Queensland University in Brisbane, Australia where he is attending the G20 meeting."Today, I'm announcing that the US will take another important step. We will contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help developing nations deal with climate change," Obama said in his speech in Brisbane, bringing the climate change issue to the fore as a key debating point during the G20 meet Interestingly, the host country Australia and the world\u2019s present top carbon emitter China did not initially want the climate change agenda to figure at all during the G20 summit. India had, however, insisted for this agenda to come up during the august gathering of major economies.The US announcement came just four days ahead of the pledging conference for the capitalization of the GCF in Berlin on November 19-20. The American pledge is seen as a step to inspire other rich nations to make similar pledge in Berlin.The Fund, which was established in 2010, recently became operational with countries developing a set of ground rules for its operation. It is a key part of the $100 billion a year promised by rich countries to developing ones from 2020 onwards in support of their ambition to mitigate emissions and adapt to climatic impacts.Though the $6 billion, pledged so far, is much less than the intended amount, it may send a positive signal to the developing countries ahead of Lima conference next month.India and other developing countries have long been demanding early capitalization of the GCF so that the money can be used to buy intellectual property rights (IPR) of the high-cost green technology for the poor nations.The other countries which have, so far, pledged to the GCF include Germany, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Mexico and the Republic of Korea.The US pledge to contribute to the GCF is the second move of the country in past four days towards its effort to contribute to face the challenges of climate change. On Wednesday, the US along with China had promised to take steps to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases.Under the bilateral deal that was signed in Beijing, the US had pledged to reduce emissions by 26-28% below the 2005 levels by 2025 while China promised to achieve the peaking of carbon emissions around 2030 and try to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030.\u201cNew pledges now could have a positive impact on the next big round of climate negotiations which get underway in Lima, Peru in a few weeks\u2019 time in advance of the Paris conference at the end of 2015. We and others have often suggested that a positive level for the GCF, going into in Lima, would be $10 billion \u2014 the announcement by the US and others puts us closer to that aim,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in a statement.

VNEW DELHI: With India getting ready to give a big push to tap solar energy in the next six to eight years, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday pitched for a global effort to make clean energy available to all through concerted actions which can be a major economic opportunity for all countries across the globe.He articulated his point in his statement on energy at G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia.Seeking collective R&D effort and collaboration in the direction of having clean energy path, Modi urged the leaders of big economies to set up a "global virtual centre" for clean energy research and development, with adequate public funding, which will fund collaborative projects in diverse sources of clean energy, smart grids and energy efficiency.His remarks came at the time when his government is planning to target up to 100,000 MW of solar generation by 2022, far more than an existing 20,000 MW target by 2020.The Prime Minister, however, expressed the need of his country to bank on coal to supply electricity to its power-starved population while simultaneously moving on a clean energy path through solar, wind and nuclear power generation.Though he spoke about India's necessity to bank on coal, he emphasized on the use of "clean coal technology".He said, "In countries like India, there are vast opportunities for those wishing to invest in clean coal technology, since our dependence will not reduce very soon".It is expected that the PM would unveil his country's big renewable plan in the run up to the Paris climate talks of next year which would, hopefully, give the world a universal climate deal which can be implemented from 2020 onwards.India will talk about its renewable energy plan also at Lima where the climate negotiations will take place in December.\u2022 Increased access to affordable, assured and clean energy supply for all should be our primary goal. It is a major economic opportunity for all countries.\u2022 Let us make an ambitious and innovative effort to make renewable, especially solar energy, competitive with conventional energy. In Gujarat, the canal-top project worked well and saved water, too.\u2022 Pricing of carbon, especially in mature markets with universal availability of power, can stimulate shift to renewable energy.\u2022 Let us increase our collective R&D efforts and collaboration; and, ensure dissemination to all countries. For this, I would propose that we set up a global virtual centre for clean energy research and development, with adequate public funding, which will fund collaborative projects in diverse sources of clean energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc. India and the United States have built an excellent virtual centre on a bilateral basis, with matching public and private funding. We can select a team of outstanding experts to evaluate and judge research projects. The results should be available to all countries.\u2022 We should also discuss innovative funding models to ensure rapid expansion of renewable energy in decentralized manner in rural areas.\u2022 In countries like India, there are vast opportunities for those wishing to invest in clean coal technology, since our dependence will not reduce very soon.\u2022 Nuclear energy can still be a safe, reliable and clean source of energy. It will be an important part of our mix.\u2022 Energy efficiency is the best source of clean energy. In India, for example, building energy efficiency and efficiency in areas such as buildings, household appliances and industrial goods is receiving strong attention. I invite you to come and invest in this sector in India.\u2022 I also believe that change in lifestyle and economy in consumption will be the most enduring response to energy challenges.\u2022 G20 can be effective in promoting an integrated the natural gas market, ensuring freer trade in gas and ensuring that the markets operate more efficiently.

VPrime Minister Modi's 'Sherpa' at the G-20 Summit, Suresh Prabhu, on Sunday said India's concerns on issues like climate change and food security were discussed at the event.\u000a\u000a"The G-20 has also addressed the issue related to climate change in a significant way. And I think that has been a very important development because (on) climate change we are very keen that it should be under the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change. Because as you know, there have been efforts to derail that process, while climate change is necessary but at the same time some countries may not try to necessarily follow with the Framework Convention which was made under the United Nations aegis. So, we insisted on that," Prabhu told the media at a press conference here.\u000a\u000a"And other important part has been the 'adaptation'. Because as you know, a country like is facing enormous challenges in dealing with climate change, which is a reality as a result of past emissions. And, therefore, if the past emissions is a reality then adaptation is a necessity," he said.\u000a\u000aPrabhu also referred to getting a say in terms of its concerns on food security.\u000a\u000a"Another very interesting part, as you know historically the Bali Action Plan which included a huge agenda on development, there has been a very significant portion which has been mentioned here which actually says that we welcome the breakthrough on the full and prompt implementation for the trade facilitation agreement and includes provision on food security," he said.\u000a\u000a"This is now welcome by all the G-20 countries that food security is welcome. Most importantly, we commit to implement all elements of Bali package and swiftly define the WTO work programme on the remaining issues of the Doha Development Agenda to get negotiation back on track," he added.

VNEW DELHI: Railway ministry is likely to have a separate directorate to promote environment-friendly activities as new minister Suresh Prabhu wants to give a boost to the use of green fuel such as solar and wind energy.Environment management directorate, the proposed new wing of the national transporter, is also likely to promote plantation of fruit-bearing trees on railway land and prepare a strategy for water conservation in a big way.Currently, Railways has about two dozens directorates and the number will only go up with this new addition."We are examining the possibility of creating a dedicated directorate for proliferation of non-conventional and renewable energy as new Railway minister Suresh Prabhu wants to give a boost to the use of green fuel in Railways," a senior railway ministry official said.Prabhu has undertaken many new initiatives to mark a change in the ailing national transporter including a plan to reward railway employees for completing projects on time and bringing transparency and accountability on the part of officials in rail functioning.The Narendra Modi-led NDA government, which had development of renewable energy as a major poll plank, has further seemed to have influenced the Railways to go "green".According to the official, a blueprint is being prepared to generate at least 20 per cent of its total energy through non-conventional and renewable energy like solar and wind besides the use of bio-diesel. The annual fuel bill of Indian Railways for electricity and diesel is about Rs 28,500 crore.Till now there was no single dedicated wing for taking up environment-friendly activities as various directorates are involved in solar, wind and bio-diesel projects.The proposed directorate is expected to take up not only solar and wind energy projects but also tree plantation drive and water conservation management. There are vast land tracks of Railways all over the country which can be taken up for tree plantations."Tree plantation will serve twin purposes. While it will increase the green cover in the area, it will also be effective for preventing encroachment of railway land," the official said.

Developed countries agreed to mobilise $100 billion per year till 2020, and the crisis of funding and technology transfer continues to plague the negotiations.\u000a\u000aAt Paris, countries have to agree on a deal with new goals which will take the world post 2020. The Lima meeting, coming soon after the climate deal between the U.S. and China, seeks to set the tone for the \u201cParis Protocol\u201d and countries will be wrangling over their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), which they have to finalise by March 2015. The synthesis report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made it clear that adaptation alone will not prevent the world from hurtling into a climate calamity. Countries have to focus on mitigation and their national emission cuts should reflect this aspect.\u000a\u000aWhile the U.S.-China deal is low on ambition, there is nothing preventing India from taking on ambitious cuts and opting for a low carbon path. The key issues at Lima will centre around emission cuts, finance and according to activist groups, this will include finance for forests, land use and near-term mitigation potential.\u000a\u000aIndian experts have been saying that India should set the ground for tighter emissions cuts and ambitious national action plans and there is no need to be bound by the U.S.-China deal. The UNFCCC has underscored the need to act urgently and says that while there has been some success in climate change mitigation, global emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise.\u000a\u000aSo that the world has a chance to stay below an agreed maximum 2C rise, beyond which even more serious climate change impacts will occur, governments agreed at the Doha talks to speedily work toward a universal climate change agreement by 2015 covering all countries. They also agreed to find ways to scale up efforts before 2020 beyond the existing pledges to curb emissions.

VClimate change is back on the international agenda. The announcement of a greenhouse gas emissions agreement between the United States and China had been preceded by a European Union commitment to further unilaterally cut carbon emissions. The G-20 summit called on its members to get their own climate change plans ready for the Paris summit next year.\u000a\u000aThe specifics of these agreements are less important than the momentum they impart to multilateral climate change diplomacy. India needs to pay more attention to this development: The manner in which the environment ministry was blind-sided by the US-China agreement was a striking example of how out of touch Indian officialdom is with global developments. New Delhi should focus on where climate change diplomacy will be going in the coming years. Given the growing problems of air pollution and rising fossil fuel imports, there is a strong case for India to invest more in a renewable energy future.\u000a\u000aThere is a case for saying India is already doing quite a lot at home in this field, especially with its ambitious solar and energy plans coming to fruition, so why bother with international agreements? The answer is multiple. One, a renewable energy future comes with costs and is made easier with technology. Sensibly negotiated agreements would open access to both.\u000a\u000aTwo, green bills afflict all countries. Much of international climate change diplomacy is about trying to shift these costs to the wallets of other countries.\u000a\u000aThree, international agreements are a good way to lock in long-term policies at home. China\u2019s Xi Jinping is using climate change agreements to carve in stone structural reforms that he wants his country to undertake.\u000a\u000aWhen countries like the US and China sign bilateral agreements that change their energy profiles, they will seek to ensure that other countries do not get an economic edge from these actions. They will seek to multilateralise these actions in a manner that favours them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often said he takes climate change \u201cseriously\u201d. He now needs to take the multilateral side of climate change seriously as well.

VCHENNAI: As it readies for the UN climate change conference at Lima, the Centre is tapping the expertise of Indian scientific institutions, the latest being the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Chennai. Union minister Prakash Javadekar was closeted with scientists and strategists of the foundation on Saturday to educate himself on on greenhouse emissions, climate change and their impact on agriculture and livelihood to counter claims of developed countries at Lima.\u000a\u000aThe developed countries, especially US have been claiming that emission was high in China and India but were refusing to scale down their lifestyle to cut emissions, Javadekar said. Data put out by developed countries about emissions in developing countries seemed to vary from time to time, he added.\u201cI am going to present that the world should come together to fight climate change. We are going to drive our government\u2019s agenda \u2013 clean air, clean energy, and clean water. There should be a joint collaborative research to save the Earth and we will not need intellectual property rights in that case.\u201d India will launch an exclusive satellite for studies related to environment, forests and climate change, he said.When M S Swaminathan said he has been advocating a biogas plants at plantations, the minister said that people did not like to stir dung manually. \u201cThey find it demeaning. We need to design a simple machine to stir the dung for biogas plants,\u201d he said.Lauding the Green Revolution scripted by Swaminathan, the minister said, \u201cThe Green Revolution should continue. We should go forward with all science and technology available for farming.\u201dHe also visited the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), established by the ministry in partnership with Anna University. R Ramesh, director of the centre, explained research studies such as mapping of sediment cells, national assessment of shoreline change, offshore wind energy and delineation of coastal ecologically sensitive areas.

VIn what could push the country into the same league as the US and China, India is likely to announce new, bigger and more effective targets by the time US President comes here as chief guest for the Republic Day parade in January next year. The announcement is likely to include an \u2018aspirational\u2019 peaking year for India\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aThe move follows discussions in the government, led by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\u000a\u000aIt is expected on Tuesday, the Union Cabinet will clear the final brief for the negotiating delegation to the on climate change, led by environment minister Prakash Javadekar.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, India had committed to a 20-25 per cent cut in its by 2020, compared to the levels in 2005.\u000a\u000aThe process to make fresh and enhanced commitments to the international community was in the works for the past few months, with the government commissioning studies to assess and project India\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The results of these studies are due in December. A joint US-China announcement has incentivised India to make an early announcement in this regard.\u000a\u000aThough the announcements by the US and China weren\u2019t seen as ambitious by the Indian government, these were appreciated for their political significance.\u000a\u000aIn a joint statement with the US, China had announced its greenhouse gas emissions were likely to peak around 2030 and fall subsequently. Developing countries, requiring more space for their developmental priorities, are expected by the global community to draw a lower-than-usual emission trajectory of their increasing emissions through the coming years and suggest a year by which their emissions will start falling in absolute terms, while developed countries are required to announce absolute emission cuts.\u000a\u000aA source in the government said, \u201cThe consultations have begun for it. We should be able to narrow down on the nature of targets we should aspire to. It is likely to include an indicative year by which India\u2019s emissions could peak, as well as a fresh target for lowering the economy\u2019s \u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother official Business Standard spoke to said the Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was looking at announcing a package that would include the ambitious solar power targets it was planning on the domestic front. This is expected to be further beefed up with indications of the extra efforts India will make under the energy efficiency mission. The mission is also being revamped.\u000a\u000a\u201cConfabulations are being held with various experts and ministries and discussions have also been held at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aIndia and all other countries are required to formally submit their \u2018intended nationally determined contributions\u2019, or INDCs, to the UN climate convention after March. These INDCs are meant to be the voluntarily and domestically determined action these countries will take to fight under a new agreement to be signed in Paris in 2015.\u000a\u000aAs of now, it is unclear how these will be reviewed on the principles of common but differentiated responsibility and equity, or for adequacy to keep global temperatures within tolerable limits.\u000a\u000aEven as more than half a dozen Indian delegates have flown to Lima, Javadekar is slated to travel to the Peruvian capital during the weekend for the second week of talks, which are led by ministers. It is expected he will get his red-lines for the coming negotiations cleared from the Cabinet on Tuesday. "The advantage with this NDA government taking a call on multilateral negotiations such as these is the sense of decisiveness right from the top," said an official on the Indian delegation. He was referring to the differences that remained entrenched between different key personalities in the United Progressive Alliance government on climate change, leading to changes in its international stance through the years.\u000a\u000aThe discussions for the big announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take several more rounds of discussions between relevant ministries and experts, government sources said. They added these should be ready for announcement around the time Obama visited the capital.\u000a\u000aA GIANT LEAP

VNew Delhi: India is working on a plan to form an association of countries with high solar power potential, aimed at lowering the cost of solar energy and improving the country\u2019s standing at the global climate change and environment protection discussions.\u000a\u000aThe proposal aims to bring together 56 countries with more than 300 days of good solar radiation. The move follows India substantially revising an earlier target of achieving 20,000 megawatts (MW) solar power capacity by 2022 to 100,000MW, requiring an investment of around Rs.6.5 trillion over five years.\u000a\u000aIn May, the World Trade Organization (WTO) set up a dispute settlement panel after the US complained that certain provisions mandating use of local inputs in India\u2019s solar power generation programme were not compatible with multilateral trade rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea is to have common standards and research and development so that the prices come down,\u201d said a person aware of the development requesting anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe latest move also comes in the backdrop of the US and China inking a climate change deal wherein the US will reduce its emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 level by 2025 and China will reach the peak of its harmful carbon dioxide emissions around 2030.\u000a\u000aIndia has a solar generation capacity of 2,900MW. Of India\u2019s installed power generation capacity of 254,049.49MW, power generated from renewable sources accounts for only 12.47%, or 31,692.14MW.\u000a\u000aA senior government official, who also didn\u2019t want to be identified, confirmed India\u2019s strategy and said, \u201cThe idea is to have India in a leadership role. The concept is ready and has been prepared by the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE). It will be circulated for consultation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of the countries that receive good days of solar radiation are near the equator and are not big economies. We have some technology and the cost of manufacturing here is low. Such an association will strengthen our position and improve our profile at the world stage by showcasing our commitment towards the renewable energy sector,\u201d added the government official quoted above.\u000a\u000aThe government has an ambitious plan to locally manufacture as many as 181 products currently imported at a cost of at least $18.1 billion, Mint reported on 19 November. The plan is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cMake In India\u201d programme to boost local manufacturing and create jobs. While inaugurating the campaign, Modi had said India should become a part of the global value chain.\u000a\u000aQueries emailed to an MNRE spokesperson on 26 November remained unanswered till press time.\u000a\u000aIndia fell to 142 of 189 economies in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business index, from 131 last year. It\u2019s ranked 76 of 143 nations in the Global Innovation Index 2014, published by Cornell University, and 71 of 144 in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report.\u000a\u000aModi has actively tried to lift India\u2019s image overseas and has participated at multilateral summits such as Group of 20 countries, Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), East Asia Summit (EAS) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change recommends the country generate 10% of its power from solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources by 2015, and 15% by 2020, up from 12.47% now.\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s strategy to focus on renewables also stems from the fact that India has an energy import bill of $150 billion, which is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports 80% of its crude oil and 18% of its natural gas needs.

VWith this year on track to become the warmest on record, more than 190 nations began talks Monday on new limits for the greenhouse gases that are causing billions of dollars in damage and making life harder to sustain around the world.\u000a\u000aNew targets for limiting gas emissions blamed on fossil fuels were announced ahead of this conference by the U.S., the European Union and China, the first Asian nation to make such a pledge. This has injected optimism into negotiations that are supposed to climax in Paris next year with the adoption of a long-awaited climate pact.\u000a\u000aBut India, Russia, Japan and Australia have yet to commit to new limits; and scientists say much sharper emissions cuts are needed in coming decades to keep global warming within 2 degrees C (3.6 F) of pre-industrial times, the overall goal of the U.N. talks. Global temperatures have already risen about 0.8 degrees C (1.3 F), and more heat-trapping gases are emitted every year.\u000a\u000aEvery degree of warming can cause long-lasting impacts, from melting ice caps and rising sea levels to the loss of species.\u000a\u000a"Human influence on the climate system is clear," Rajendra Pachauri, who leads the U.N.'s panel of climate-change experts, told delegates at the opening session in Lima.\u000a\u000aTo have a decent chance of reversing the warming trend before the planet hits the 2-degree mark, the world needs to slash emissions by 40 percent to 70 percent by 2050 and to near-zero by the end of the century, according to the panel's assessments.\u000a\u000aScientists are practically united in warning that there's no way to meet this goal by continuing business as usual.\u000a\u000aIt would require a sustained, permanent, worldwide shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to power homes, cars and industries. And even then, the transition might not happen fast enough without a large-scale deployment of new technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a"We call on the world to ensure the opportunity does not slip away," said Nauru's Marlene Moses, representing a group of Pacific island nations threatened by rising seas.\u000a\u000aThe biggest challenge for the U.N.-sponsored talks is dividing responsibilities between rich Western countries and emerging economies such as China and India. The poorest and most vulnerable nations also need help to develop their economies without aggravating global warming, and to adapt to climate changes that are already causing more violent weather, prolonged droughts and intense flooding.\u000a\u000aAmong them is host country Peru, whose glaciers are melting ever-faster, threatening water supplies on the coastal desert where 70 percent of its citizens live and threatening the nation's hydropower and food security.\u000a\u000aThe negotiators in Lima are focusing on a draft agreement that can be refined before the Paris meeting a year from now.\u000a\u000aA key issue is what data each government should provide so that formal emissions targets can be compared.\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries also want rich nations to make good on promises of financing to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change impacts, which range from the spread of diseases to coastal flooding to major disruptions to agriculture.\u000a\u000aThere's no common agreement on how that money should be used; for example, The Associated Press found that Japan has spent $1 billion of its climate financing on new power plants in Indonesia that burn coal \u2014 the top source of man-made emissions. Japan says it improves the environment because the new plans burn cleaner, but critics said coal has no place in climate financing.\u000a\u000aThe U.N.'s weather agency is expected to present temperature data showing 2014 is shaping up to become the hottest year on record.\u000a\u000aPeru is among the hardest-hit countries. The Andean nation has 70 percent of the world's tropical glaciers, which have lost more than a fifth of their mass in just three decades, putting 300,000 highlanders under severe stress as pastures and croplands dry up, the planting cycle becomes more erratic and cold snaps more severe.\u000a\u000aLima is the world's second-largest desert capital after Cairo, Egypt, and its 10 million inhabitants depend on glacial runoff for hydropower and to irrigate crops. Plants and animals are disappearing from Peru's cloud forests, its fisheries are declining and annual floods are more severe.\u000a\u000aYearly economic damage from global warming in Latin America and the Caribbean will reach $100 billion a year by mid-century, according to research done for the Inter-American Development bank.\u000a\u000aCollectively, the region causes less than 10 percent of global emissions, and yet its people are already bearing an oversized burden.\u000a\u000a"The people with the least intensive climate lifestyles are suffering the most," said geographer Jeffrey Bury of The University of California at Santa Cruz, who studies the social and economic impacts of glacier loss.\u000a\u000a"I think we can use the Andes high mountain environment," he said, "to understand what the future holds for the rest of us."

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe \u2018Twentieth Conference of the Parties\u2019 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ended in Lima on December 14, as the negotiations >extended by two days beyond schedule. The Paris 2015 deadline for finalising an international agreement on climate change fuelled a sense of urgency at these talks. There was some optimism ahead of the conference, with the U.S.-China deal in November being considered a breakthrough and the European Union coming on board making serious commitments to cut emissions. But this hope soon fizzled out as rifts between \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 countries became deeper. In a familiar dialectical movement, the shift from hope to impasse eventually led to a last-minute deal, thus saving the talks from failure. The document that was finally agreed upon, calls for a commitment from all parties to an \u201cambitious agreement in 2015 that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities\u201d (CDR). It \u201curges\u201d developed countries to provide financial support to developing countries to meet their \u201cambitious mitigation\u201d goals. The agreement urges parties to take national pledges by finalising their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) by November 2015. However, the agreement is criticised for being a \u201cwatered down\u201d and \u201clacklustre plan\u201d, leaving all political issues unresolved. But Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got what we wanted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe \u2018developing versus developed country\u2019 schism was at the centre of the debates. In trying to dilute this binary, wealthy nations like the U.S., and those of the EU argued that emissions from developing countries are consistently rising and they need to commit to more serious emission cuts. But India accused them of watering down the CDR principle envisaged in earlier agreements. The EU strongly favoured a review process to ensure accountability for the pledges made but China immediately blocked it, on grounds of national sovereignty. India stuck to its conventional position that the developed countries should shoulder a bigger burden as they are responsible for the problem in the first place, while poverty alleviation would continue to be India\u2019s primary concern. India may have demonstrated concern about climate change issues and rightly asserted the need to balance environment with socio-economic concerns. Yet, before it is too late, the nation has to acknowledge that its emissions are rising dangerously. Instead of always passing the burden onto others, it has to take responsibility for its actions. India has to make a pragmatically determined national pledge in Paris next year, backed by stronger domestic policies and a shift to clean, renewable energy.

VLast month\u2019s surprise climate change agreement between the US and China \u2014 the world\u2019s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) \u2014 infused new hope that the global gridlock in arriving at a substantive deal to replace the Kyoto Protocol could be broken at the 20th conference of parties (COP-20) in Lima. But the script at COP-20, which ended on Sunday, deep into extra time, was disappointingly close to those of COPs past, such as Copenhagen in 2009. The yawning chasm between the concerns of the developed and developing countries proved nearly insurmountable, and a last-minute face-saving accord was hammered out only by respecting each country\u2019s red lines. The final accord, low in ambition, postpones all fundamental battles to 2015, when countries are expected to devise a new international legal architecture on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe disagreements conformed largely to the rich versus poor nation faultline in climate diplomacy. The points of contention that remain have bedeviled negotiations for years. Although governments are obliged to present their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) \u2014 voluntary targets and actions set by each nation \u2014 before the crucial United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Paris in December next year, the language is so carefully ambiguous that they \u201cmay include\u201d (or not) detailed information on how and when they intend to cut emissions. In a win for developing countries, including India, adaptation measures may be included under INDCs alongside mitigation efforts. The North\u2019s demand for review of emissions targets was dropped in deference to the South\u2019s objections but equally, the former got its way on the issue of finance, no mention of which was made in the final text. The developing world also had to struggle to insert the longstanding principle of common but differentiated responsibilities enshrined in the UNFCCC, and was unable to add a direct reference to the principle of equity.\u000a\u000aBut the Lima talks were no loss for India, and may indeed have consolidated its position as a pre-eminent representative of developing country concerns. The conference saw renewed unity among the G77 and the Like Minded Developing Countries grouping \u2014 India is a part of both \u2014 and this coming together has strengthened their negotiating position ahead of Paris, where the task of concluding a meaningful deal has been rendered much tougher.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VCompared with eye-catching renewable power technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, energy efficiency is nearly invisible. But advocates say doing more with less power may be an even more critical weapon in the fight against climate change and offers big economic benefits, too.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWorldwide, governments, companies and families could be saving trillions of dollars by improving efficiency with cars that go farther on less fuel and improved appliances, light bulbs and factories, experts say.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s logical, because we simply waste so much,\u201d said Harry Verhaar, head of global and public affairs at Philips Lighting and chairman of the European Alliance to Save Energy. \u201cSome people call energy efficiency low-hanging fruit. I would even say energy efficiency is fruit lying on the ground. We only need to bend over and pick it up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRealising those energy savings would be a huge boon to the climate, ease illness-causing air pollution, reduce many nations\u2019 reliance on fuel imports and increase competitiveness by lowering costs, the advocates say. It creates jobs in fields like upgrading buildings, and is generally cheaper than the alternative of constructing new power plants and buying more energy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut increasing efficiency is logistically complicated, requiring many individuals and organisations to take a tremendous number of small steps, and most nations have failed to aggressively pursue the potential savings. Even Germany, which topped the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy\u2019s rankings as the most efficient of the world\u2019s 16 biggest economies, scored only 65 of a possible 100 points, noted Rachel Young, the lead author. Denmark and Switzerland, too small to be included in the survey, are doing more, she said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cEnergy efficiency is everywhere and nowhere at the same time,\u201d said Jonathan Sinton, senior energy specialist at the World Bank. \u201cPower generation happens in a place, in a piece of equipment that you can see and touch. But energy efficiency happens everyplace energy is, and that pervasiveness makes it really, really hard to deal with.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome also argue that making energy cheaper by reducing demand just leads consumers to use more, a phenomenon called the rebound effect. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the effect was real but relatively modest, with about 20 per cent of saved energy in developed countries being used as a result.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe countries that have made the most progress on efficiency are those whose governments have prioritised it, Nadel said. Many are in Europe, where Germany, for example, requires regular efficiency audits of manufacturers and has stringent building codes, Young said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists, though, are disappointed with an October agreement by European Union leaders to set a non-binding target of increasing the bloc\u2019s energy efficiency by at least 27 per cent by 2030, as part of a broader climate deal.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMonica Frassoni, president of the European alliance, said that would hardly exceed the rate of efficiency improvements already happening, and stronger government action was needed. \u201cThese things do not fall from the sky,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need political leadership and you need money.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChina has made major strides in recent years and ranks fourth on the efficiency scorecard. When Deng Xiaoping set his sights in the early 1980s on quadrupling economic output, China\u2019s leaders realised that, without dramatic efficiency improvements, it would depend heavily on imported energy, Sinton said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIt really takes persistence, and persistence is what has characterised the Chinese effort,\u201d he said. \u201cThey began to institutionalise energy efficiency, they allocated money to research and development, they started to set targets.\u201d While China still has wasteful factories and buildings, it also boasts some of the world\u2019s most efficient, he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterest in efficiency spiked worldwide during the oil embargo of the 1970s, but later waned, said Philippe Benoit, head of energy efficiency and environment at the International Energy Agency. Awareness has risen again in recent years because of climbing energy prices, concerns about supply and the threat of climate change, he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEfficiency will have to account for 40 per cent of the emission reductions if warming is to be limited to 2 Celsius, as world leaders have pledged, Benoit said. That will cost $14 trillion between now and 2035, more than $600 billion a year, doubling the current rate of spending on efficiency, the agency estimates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGradual efficiency improvements\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEven during the 1970s crisis, the United States\u2019 focus on efficiency was less intent than many nations\u2019, said Nadel. Even so, America uses half the energy per dollar of gross domestic product that it did in the 1970s and has saved more than $15 trillion since then through rising efficiency, he said. Experts say that the use of more modern cars, appliances and equipment leads to efficiency improvements of more than 1 per cent a year in developed countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Britain, the Carbon Trust has helped dozens of major companies, thousands of small ones and nearly all municipal governments to increase efficiency, said James Wilde,\u000a\u000athe group\u2019s managing director of policy and innovation. Some changes, like resetting heating systems and getting employees to turn off lights, bring big savings almost for free, he said. But, \u201cIt\u2019s one of these funny things: If it is so attractive financially, why aren\u2019t people doing it?\u201d he said. Lack of awareness, inertia and the small percentage of overall costs that energy represents for some businesses are all obstacles, he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCommercial lending for building upgrades or appliance purchases is growing, Benoit said, often through programmes that allow borrowers to make repayments through deductions from their energy bills.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn poorer countries, increasing efficiency also makes it easier to provide power to those who lack it. When poor households switch to LED light bulbs, for example, \u201cyou\u2019re getting a lot more light and leaving enough electricity to do something else, have a fan, a cell phone charger,\u201d Sinton said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite up-front costs, advocates say efficiency measures are a bargain compared with other pieces of the puzzle. \u201cEnergy efficiency is the only energy that you could say is for free, where you get your money back,\u201d Verhaar said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s energy that you don\u2019t use.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VNEW DELHI: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading UN body for the assessment of climate change, will continue its work, no matter whether countries arrive at a global climate deal next year in Paris or not. Its successive science-based reports had always been key inputs for negotiators in the past over two decades.The IPCC had come out with its last (fifth) assessment report in November ahead of the Lima climate talks. It is also most likely to come out with its sixth assessment report in future, bringing more scientific information to the table for policy-makers and general public on causes and impact of climate-damaging greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.Amid speculation over the future of the IPCC once it submitted its 'synthesis' report, its chairman R K Pachauri said his expectation was that the body would also come out with the sixth assessment report (AR6) and a decision in this regard would hopefully be taken by member countries in February, 2015."Whether it is going to be structurally identical to the fifth assessment report (AR5) or whether it would be different would be clearer by the end of February when the next plenary of the IPCC takes place", he told the TOI.Asked about future of this Nobel Prize winning UN body, Pachauri said, "I think the work of the IPCC will continue as there is also growing desire on the part of the scientific community across the world to contribute to the work".The IPCC is a scientific body which reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. It was established in 1988 to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.The body has since then come out with five successive assessment reports, telling the global community how human activities are playing havoc with environment and how it led to extreme weather events, melting of glaciers and acidification of oceans due to global warming.Pachauri said, "It seems to me that the result of the fifth assessment report would perhaps only strengthen the need for carrying out updated assessment. Given the fact that we have a lot more information and knowledge in this report (AR5) than what we had in AR4 and similarly the AR4 had much more as compared to the AR3. This only strengthens the need for coming out with successive assessment".It was the IPCC second assessment report (AR2) of 1995 that had provided important material and key inputs to negotiators in the run-up to adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.On its present task, the IPCC chief said, "We, in the immediate future, are going to ensure that the findings of the synthesis report are spread and made known to communities all over the world. This is going to be something which I personally will be focusing on in the next six to eight months".

VLet us imagine for a moment that we could change the world according to our wishes. Dramatic economic inequality gives way to social and political inclusion. Universal human rights become a reality. We end deforestation and the destruction of arable land. Fish stocks recover. Two billion people look forward to a life without poverty, hunger, and violence. Rather than paying lip service to climate change and resource scarcity, we start to respect and uphold the limits of our planet and its atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThat was the aim in 2001, when the United Nations adopted the Millennium Development Goals. And it will be the aim next year, when the MDGs expire and the UN adopts a successor framework for environmental and development policy. The coming set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will seek to protect ecosystems, conserve resources, and, as with the MDGs, lift millions of people out of poverty.\u000a\u000aCombining environmental and developmental frameworks is a good idea\u2014one that builds on the success of a host of legally binding international conventions and agreements crafted under the UN\u2019s auspices to protect the climate, conserve biodiversity, uphold human rights, and reduce poverty. Though they may not be perfect, they have led to the creation of institutional processes that encourage countries to meet their promises and embolden citizens to hold governments accountable.\u000a\u000aBut, though the SDGs will thus stand on solid legal ground, that ground must be developed further. For starters, global agreements and targets have not yet been put in place for major environmental challenges, including the destruction of fertile topsoil and global plastic production. Such agreements will be necessary to enable the SDGs to consider human rights, the environment, and development holistically.\u000a\u000aResearchers and civil-society organizations have been calling for a reversal of soil degradation by 2020, and are pressing for at least one international panel of experts to meet at the UN to address this central aspect of global food security. Every year, 12 million hectares of land are lost to overuse and excessive application of fertilizers. The environmental impact is magnified by large-scale farming. The social consequences can also be severe: eviction, the loss of livelihoods, and violent conflict.\u000a\u000aThe use of plastic must also be reined in. Since the 1950s, worldwide production has increased by a factor of one hundred. Every year, more than 280 million tons of plastic is produced, with vast quantities making their way into groundwater, rivers, and oceans. Though plastic is not biodegradable, not a single country has pledged to prevent it from entering our environment.\u000a\u000aAnother largely unexplored possibility would be to set targets for phasing out environmentally damaging and socially detrimental subsidies. Globally, such subsidies, like those offered by the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy, run into the hundreds of billions of dollars, draining budgets and often doing nothing for the poor. Cutting them would not only remove perverse incentives; it would also free up money for education, universal health care, and infrastructure in rural areas, where it is needed to create income opportunities.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, we are unlikely to get the world of our wishes. The SDG negotiations reflect what is currently possible in a multilateral framework: relatively little. No government is truly willing to tackle the causes of inequality and hunger, which would require making fair taxation and comprehensive welfare a top priority. Such reforms would be more effective than any development aid, but for now they are off limits.\u000a\u000aThe rules of the global economy also remain untouchable, making it nearly impossible to restructure financial and trade policies to ensure that they do not result in more poverty, unchecked climate change, and irreversible resource destruction.\u000a\u000aThe language agreed upon so far is not reassuring. A timeworn commitment to economic growth at all cost is no answer to the question of how development can be balanced against the limits of our planet and the fact that billions of people live in poverty. In a finite world, infinite growth is impossible, and rising output will not put food on everyone\u2019s table if the benefits of growth are not fairly distributed.\u000a\u000aIt is not only the advanced countries that are impeding the creation of a bolder development agenda. Elites in emerging and developing countries are using the SDG negotiations primarily as a platform to call for international aid transfers. The UN is only as good as its members. We will know how good they are by the extent to which they view the SDGs as an opportunity to establish truly new priorities and truly universal goals for environmental and development policy in the twenty-first century.\u000a\u000aBarbara Unmuessig is president of the Heinrich Bll Foundation.\u000a\u000a2014/Project Syndicate\u000a\u000aComments are welcome at views@livemint.com

VAssured of government\u2019s backing, the Indian wind power industry is ending the year on a high note, but also with a problem it would not be unhappy with - meeting the stiff targets set by the government.\u000a\u000aIndia has taken nearly a quarter century to create wind power capacity of 22,200 MW. But now, Power Minister Piyush Goyal wants the industry to ramp up installations, so that the capacity additions in 2018-19 are 10,000 MW. The most the industry added in any year was 3,168 MW in 2011-12.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe government has given us everything we wanted, and more,\u201d notes an industry insider, pointing to the grant of the industry\u2019s long-standing request for restoring the tax-saving \u2018accelerated depreciation\u2019 duty, and the exemption from the 4 per cent special additional duty on imported components for wind turbines. On the works is a proposal to impose a \u2018renewable generation obligation\u2019 that will force companies putting up coal or lignite based thermal power plants to create an additional 10 per cent of their project capacities as renewable energy plants. This is expected to give that \u2018extra push\u2019, as cash-rich public sector companies such as NTPC, NLC and DVC will quickly come up with largish wind (or solar) projects.\u000a\u000aHaving given the industry all it wanted, the government is now saying, \u201cgo, do it\u201d. That is exactly what daunts the industry. In 2014-15, India will see wind power capacity additions between 2,000 MW and 2,500 MW, roughly the same as last year. But to ramp it up 4-5 times in four years is not easy.\u000a\u000aThe challenges are well-recognised, though each player in the industry ranks them differently. Here is generally how the industry views various problems:\u000a\u000aLand and access to construction site: A big issue with all sorts of local satraps flexing their muscle, but not a deal-breaker problem. Land middlemen have evolved as part of the ecosystem and all it takes is to pay your way through. However, it would help if the government would earmark areas for wind development.\u000a\u000aTransmission infrastructure: Indeed, a big worry could be a deal-breaker. But the hope is that the government would keep its promise of strengthening transmission lines with projects such as the \u2018green corridor\u2019.\u000a\u000aFinance: A major issue because even equity funds are drying up. In the last couple of years, very few wind \u2018independent power producers\u2019 have come up - some believe that only two have come up - Ostro Energy and Energon, backed by Actis and the Singapore-based Equis Funds Group, respectively. Sources say that wind power producers such as ReNew Power, Green Infra, Mytrah and Bharat Light & Power may be scrapping the bottom of the committed call-able equity funds and getting more may require some convincing.\u000a\u000aThe industry is seeking interest subvention and project-specific working capital (as opposed to company-specific limits). It wants banks not club \u2018renewable energy\u2019 industry with \u2018power\u2019 so that this industry is not affected by the NPA stigma and so that the banks do not tell it, \u201csorry, we can\u2019t lend you because we have reached the limit of our exposure to the power sector.\u201d\u000a\u000aComponents and logistics: The Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers\u2019 Association worries that beyond a capacity of 5,000 MW, the industry will face shortage of critical components particularly, bearings and yaw motors. It fears that the suppliers will not ramp up their capacities in tandem and would prefer to wait and see if the promised demand is indeed there, before putting down money in capacity expansions. However, others in the industry, notably, Gamesa and Suzlon, do not believe that components shortage will be a major problem.\u000a\u000aThen there is logistics - mainly, trailers to carry the ever-getting-longer blades - will be another issue. Even if enough trailers are available, shortages will be seen in patches of time, when order executions gather pace.\u000a\u000aMost believe that up to a capacity of 5,000 MW, these issues may not pose a threat, but beyond that things get really shaky. But still 5,000 MW is a respectable number and to that extent, the industry is smiling at the end of 2014.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAfter taking action against the international environment group Greenpeace, the government has clamped down on four American NGOs working in the same field \u2014 Avaaz, Bank Information Centre (BIC), Sierra Club and 350.org.\u000a\u000aOver the past month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to stop all foreign funding into the accounts of these NGOs or their representatives without MHA clearance. A letter issued by the Director of the Monitoring unit for NGOs said it had been decided \u201cto keep a watch on all the activities funded by U.S.-based donor agencies\u201d and lists the four groups.\u000a\u000aThe order could create a controversy ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s visit to India this month, given that the U.S. has in the past issued statements regarding India\u2019s restrictions on international NGOs.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, after India took similar action against anti-nuclear groups in Kudankulam, the U.S. State Department had denied it was linked to the NGOs, but said such groups \u201care among the essential building blocks of any healthy democracy.\u201d Later, the funding for Greenpeace was also frozen.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the latest MHA order, every fund transfer from abroad for their activists in India will be held back pending clearance.\u000a\u000aAccording to RBI records, the international NGOs were not registered with the government. Neither had their employees in India applied for FCRA clearance. The MHA is also going to inquire into all remittances into India from these groups since January 2013.\u000a\u000aLast year also saw the leak of an IB report titled \u201cConcerted efforts by select foreign-funded NGOs to take down Indian development projects.\u201d It contended that several foreign-funded environmental NGOs were targeting development projects across the country. Apart from Greenpeace, Sierra Club and 350.org were mentioned in Annexure B of the IB report in a graph.\u000a\u000aHome Ministry and Foreign Ministry officials did not comment on the order and declined to speak about why U.S.-based NGOs had been singled out for scrutiny.\u000a\u000aReason to worry, says NGO representative\u000a\u000aA representative of an American green NGO, one of four whose foreign funding will be stopped unless they are cleared by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), told TheHindu that the move appeared to question democratic effort that individuals and organisations could exercise in the country. \u201cFalse allegations against activists of political subversion are becoming commonplace and that is enough reason to worry,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aA letter the representative received dated December 10 said the MHA Foreigners Division (FCRA wing) regulates receipt of foreign contribution by NGOs to ensure that it is utilised for bonafide welfare activities, without compromising on concerns about national interest and security.\u000a\u000aThe government has clamped down on four American NGOs \u2014 Avaaz, Bank Information Centre (BIC), Sierra Club and 350.org. Earlier it had acted against Greenpeace.\u000a\u000aWith a claimed membership of about 40 million worldwide, New York-based Avaaz works on several public issues and in September 2014, it had organised a \u2018People\u2019s climate march\u2019 in Delhi.\u000a\u000aThe Bank Information Centre (BIC) is an NGO-based in Washington that tracks World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded projects worldwide, but has a special focus on India. According to a description on its website, its work involves public debate on coal and energy projects in India, as \u201cthere is a complete lack of transparency and the agencies who receive these borrowings are not accountable to the people.\u201d\u000a\u000aBIC was particularly critical of the Tata Mundhra 4,000 MW Ultra Mega Power Project in Gujarat, a key project for the Gujarat government.\u000a\u000aNew York-based NGO 350.org which works on climate-change and the California-based Sierra Club have been opposing coal imports from Australia for Indian thermal plants, including deals that were finalised during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Australia in November 2014.

VWe\u2019ve known with increasing levels of certainty that human activity (primarily by burning fossil fuels) has been the cause of this warming for 30 years. We pledged to do something about it 20 years ago.\u000a\u000aBut what have we actually done? As a world, we\u2019ve increased the amount of CO2 put into the air from human activity (burning fossil fuels, cement production etc.) from about 25 billion tons in 2000 to about 34 billion tons in 2010 \u2013 a 35% increase. To help visualise this, consider: An elephant weighs about 3 tons, so we are putting about 11 billion elephants worth of CO2 into the air from our activities each year. About half of the CO2 we put up gets absorbed by our biosphere and our oceans, but the rest keeps increasing the concentration of CO2 in the air \u2013 that is, the relative proportion of CO2 in the air compared to other gases. The concentration of CO2, measured by a unit called parts per million (ppm), has increased from 280 ppm 200 years ago to about 400 ppm today. And that has caused the world to heat up.\u000a\u000aWhat causes our apathy?\u000a\u000aEconomists ascribe this inaction to the tragedy of the commons, a theory that says that individuals acting independently and rationally according to each one's self-interest, behave against the whole group's best interests by depleting some common asset. Psychologists say this is the way our brains are wired \u2013 to ignore slow moving, complex threats. And then of course there is the literature. A Google search \u201cClimate Change India\u201d returned over 60,000 articles focussing on the China-US announcement recently and fall in rice yields, or the J&K Floods. This is like reading, \u201cBotox and Bollywood\u201d without the context. Without the context, this subject seems elitist and more remote that it is.\u000a\u000aWhat I hope to do over this series is to provide that context. I would like to provide the readers with an overview of the drivers of climate change, the landscape of actors that shape the debate on this subject and most importantly actions on what we can do. And, there\u2019s plenty we can do \u2013 from small individual actions each of us can take to larger actions for our governments to adopt \u2013 but it all starts with acknowledging there is a problem, understanding it and recognising we can do something about it.\u000a\u000aFeedback and questions may be e-mailed to climaction2015@gmail.com

VIn a bid to achieve the target of 22-gigawatt solar capacity by 2022 under the national solar mission, the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has proposed to set up 15,000 MW of grid-connected solar capacity in three tranches, with the first tranche of 3,000 MW likely to entail total investment of over R18,000 crore from the developers.\u000a\u000aThe first tranche is expected to be completed by 2017. The second and third tranches of 5,000 MW and 7,000 MW, respectively, will be implemented by 2019. The proposed capacity addition is nearly five times the current solar power capacity in the country. Out of the 3,000 MW capacity in the first tranche, first 1,000 MW capacity will be set up in Andhra Pradesh on land already identified by the state government.\u000a\u000aThe scheme is proposed to be executed by NTPC that includes preparation of detailed e-bidding guidelines. As per the proposal, the developers will submit bids quoting a fixed levelised tariff for a period of 25 years. They will then commit to sell power from their plants to NTPC through its power trading arm NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) at the quoted tariff.\u000a\u000aIn the first tranche, the proposal is to bundle 1,500 MW of unallocated thermal power from NTPC with 3,000 MW of solar power to be purchased by (NVVN) from the bidders who agree to produce and supply solar power at the lowest rate (not exceeding current SERC rate for such power). NVVN will then sell the bundled power to the interested state utilities under long-term power purchase agreement.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe rate charged to the buyers will be weighted average tariff of the solar and thermal components (bundling ratio of 2:1), plus a trading margin of 7 paise per unit, which is expected to be attractive to utilities,\u201d a government official told FE.\u000a\u000aThe tariff for thermal power component will be as per rates fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority (CERC) for power from the respective thermal power plants from which power is to be allotted.\u000a\u000aAs for 12,000 MW of capacity envisioned under tranche 2 and 3, implementation mechanism will be decided based on the experienced gathered from the execution of tranche 1. The other two tranches could require government support in the form of low-cost long-tenure loans, the proposal said.\u000a\u000aThe proposal prepared by MNRE has also envisaged that a portion of capacity to be developed be based on the domestically manufactured solar cells as well as modules and that such capacity be given certain incentives over others. The department of economic affairs has shot down the suggestion saying \u201cthe proposal of domestic content requirement in the bid process is certainly going to cause complications and lead to economic distortion. Hence, the DEA should not support this suggestion.\u201d\u000a\u000aNVVN will act as the sponsoring authority in charge of evaluating bids and issuing letters of intent. Further, it will also be entrusted with monitoring and commissioning of plants, including reporting of performance during the tenure of PPAs. The land for the projects will be provided on lease or ownership basis allowing developers to raise loans if required.

VCHANDIGARH: Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator Shivraj Patil on Thursday said that it is not only the responsibility of the government or authority, but public should also to come forward to adopt solar energy and spread it to a large extent.While interacting with media persons after inaugurating 200 KWP Grid tied Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant on 22 Huts (Porta cabins) at IRB Complex, Patil said people must come forward to adopt solar energy as it is the future.On this occasion, Patil desired that balance rooftop and huts should be covered in phase II so that IRB campus can act as role model for other people to see how beautiful it is besides generating renewable energy.He also called upon the media to create awareness about use of solar power by installation of rooftop solar plant on their houses and expressed hope that after new tariff announced by Joint Electricity Regulatory corporation (JERC) for Goa and UT, more and more people in private sector shall be attracted towards solar energy. He emphasized that solar is the ultimate perennial source of green energy , which the mankind can harness through technology & innovations.Later, while talking about his tenure, challenges, regrets, he said: "I enjoyed working in Chandigarh and my stay here is satisfied. People here are good and I received co-operation from all the ends and my officers provided every kind of support. I had a long time in Chandigarh, I spent almost 50 years in politics and now loneliness will be my problem."

VThe forthcoming visit of President Barack Obama to India has kicked off speculations on the issues he would take up with Prime Minister Modi, especially on climate change. The interest is all the more since Obama\u2019s visit to China last November was marked by the announcement by the two sides of \u201caspirational\u201d targets to reduce their global warming gas emissions with timeframes thrown in for effect.\u000a\u000aThis agreement has caught the fancy of many, generating speculation that India could also be expected to announce a \u201cpeaking\u201d year during Obama\u2019s visit.\u000a\u000aPeaking issues\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut such surmises overlook an important development that took place since last November. The Lima Conference in December brought about a qualitative change in the global discourse on combating climate change. The Lima text gives considerable latitude to all countries in setting their targets in mitigation and adaptation efforts in the hope that they would commit themselves to a higher level of performance than what a business-as-usual strategy would dictate. But whatever a country accepts as its targets would be expected to be honoured under an internationally agreed instrument.\u000a\u000aIndia has already announced a target of 20-25 per cent reduction in the greenhouse gas emission intensity of its growth to be achieved by 2020. Its absolute emissions would, however, continue to grow well beyond that year and it is not possible, at this stage, to indicate the period, let alone the year, by which they may peak. Even a \u2018Low Carbon Inclusive Growth scenario\u2019 (LCIG) worked out by an expert group has concluded that even under that scenario, coal would account for 63 per cent of the country\u2019s energy supply. India\u2019s dependence on coal for energy is, sadly, a reality.\u000a\u000aCoal concerns\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is in this background that we have to envision the discussions between the US and Indian sides during Obama\u2019s three-day visit starting January 23. While there is little scope for change in India\u2019s climate goals, there are, indeed, other areas in which the two sides can engage themselves on a long-term basis. These are, improving the generation efficiency of coal-based thermal plants, wind and solar power installations, and the distribution efficiency of power grid systems. There are immense gains to be made in terms of optimising energy recovery from the ash-laden Indian coals, bringing down the high losses in power transmission, distribution and consumption and in establishing smart grids.\u000a\u000aThe spreading of energy markets within the country and the introduction of fiscal and market-based instruments to incentivise energy efficiency would be facilitated greatly by these improvements. Not the least, smartgrids are a must for optimising the integration of renewable power with power from conventional sources.\u000a\u000aHeat recovery of about 32 per cent from coal \u2014 the current performance level in India \u2014 can go up to almost 42 per cent by deploying super critical boiler technology and still further with ultra-super critical boilers. The expert group on Low Carbon Economy has suggested, quite rightly, that at least 50 per cent of the thermal power generation capacity in 2030 should be of the supercritical variety.\u000a\u000aIn the area of renewable power, according to the Lawrence-Livermore Laboratory estimates, India\u2019s conventionally-accepted wind power potential of 49 giga watts (GW) at a windmill hub-height of 50 m can be enhanced to 748GW if the hub height is raised to 80 m. This will also help to reduce the land requirements for windmill farms.\u000a\u000aJoin hands\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTherefore, collaborative efforts between the two countries in research, design and development and transfer of technology in the areas of renewable and non-renewable power would be highly rewarding to both.\u000a\u000aA noteworthy initiative of the September 2014 meeting of the two leaders in Washington was the announcement by Obama to facilitate financing of the order of $1 billion by the US Exim Bank to enable India to procure solar technologies from the US. A similar gesture in other areas of improved energy technologies, conventional and renewable, would be welcome.\u000a\u000aThe US President\u2019s visit takes place at a time when he has cause to be buoyant with the outcome at Lima. The Lima Call for Climate Action is much to his liking as, in essence, it follows his proposal for an emissions reduction regime made at Copenhagen in 2009.\u000a\u000aIn such a mood, he would rather like to be generous and leave behind him a legacy of accord than discord with India. As for India, it should look forward to reviving the cordiality and goodwill that marked its relations with the US in the 1980s and early 1990s in the green arena.\u000a\u000aThe writer is a former secretary to the Government of India

VScientists and researchers struck a note of concern over the projected impact of climate change on Indian agriculture, especially coastal agriculture, and livestock at the just-concluded international conference on Bio-resource and Stress Management here.\u000a\u000aLaxman Singh Rathore, director general of Indian Meteorological Department, set the tone for the discussions by pointing out that mean warming in India is likely to be in the range of 1.7 to 2 degree C by 2030 and 3.3 to 4.8 degree by 2080s, relative to pre-industrial times. \u201cWarming is likely to be more over northern parts of India and a rise in night temperatures is likely across the country, except in some small pockets in the peninsular region. Rainfall is likely to decline 5-10 per cent over southern parts, while an increase of 10-20 per cent is likely over other regions,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFurther, projections of monsoon rainfall pattern over the Indian subcontinent indicate that by 2050, a 10 per cent increase in the amount and intensity of rainfall each are likely due to climate change. A one per cent increase in rainfall intensity is estimated to result in soil loss from crop lands by 1.5 per cent.\u000a\u000a\u201cAccelerated soil erosion is going to affect production of 27 major crops, including 10 oil seeds and nine pulses, resulting in a loss of production of 16 per cent, which is roughly about 13.4 million tonnes, with oilseeds accounting for 66 per cent,\u201d Rathore said.\u000a\u000aD. Raji Reddy, Director of Research at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, says that increase in temperature due to global warming may fall to 58 million tonnes by 2070 from 76 million tonnes in 2000. \u201cSimilarly, decrease in apple yield is observed in Himachal Pradesh due to lower cold periods. Also simulated yield of rice under changed climate scenarios indicate decrease in yield by 9.7 and 18.4 per cent with increase in maximum and minimum temperature by one degree C and two degrees,\u201d he pointed out.\u000a\u000aScientists at the Agro Climate Research Centre at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University have projected that productivity of irrigated rice is likely to reduce by four per cent in the coastal areas, while maize and sorghum yields could fall up to 50 per cent in certain areas.\u000a\u000aIn the light of this, scientists have called for more strategic research to identify the areas prone to climate change, drought patterns, better water management strategies, breeding of climate ready varieties and climate smart agriculture.

VHarkening back to the agroscience cooperation between India and the US that delivered the Green Revolution, joint clean energy research is now underway across collectives of leading labs and research universities in both countries on solar, biofuels and building efficiency.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, US President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh aimed to remove a long-standing barrier to deeper US-India ties through a civil nuclear cooperation deal. It was a big idea, but no one could have foreseen how big it would become. Nuclear energy is a highly technical issue, yet somehow it managed to capture, especially in India, the imagination of the public at large. In 2007, I served on the staff of the then undersecretary of state, R. Nicholas Burns \u2014 the lead negotiator on the US side \u2014 and will never forget the night a security guard at the Delhi airport recognised him. \u201cNicholas Burns! 1-2-3!\u201d he said, holding up a copy of that day\u2019s newspaper covering the ongoing 123 Agreement negotiations. Ever since those negotiations were completed, the quest for the \u201cnext big idea\u201d has hovered in the background of US-India ties.\u000a\u000aToday, clean energy cooperation has become the new big idea in US-India relations. Following the Republic Day summit between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the importance of clean energy cooperation in this relationship could not be clearer. As Modi said during their joint press conference, \u201cWhen we think about the future generations and what kind of world we are going to give them, then there is pressure\u201d to \u201cgive a better lifestyle to the future generations, a good life and a good environment\u201d. It\u2019s an area little heralded by the press and public, although it stands to change the world we live in for the better more than any other area of bilateral cooperation.\u000a\u000aIndia and the US share the urgent need to develop affordable, renewable sources of energy to power their economies, and secure themselves from the geopolitical risk of the tumultuous Middle East. Clean energy research and commercialisation bring both countries together in a shared approach to the global challenge of our time, climate change, and draw on the science and technology capabilities and talent for innovation in both countries. Modi means business on clean energy. In his eight months in office, he has already increased the target for India\u2019s use of solar energy fivefold (admittedly a highly ambitious goal) from 20 gigawatt (GW) to 100 GW, and doubled the target for wind energy from 20 GW to 40 GW by 2019.\u000a\u000aBuilding on the civil nuclear initiative, a specific focus on clean energy cooperation began in 2009. That year, Obama and then PM Singh announced the creation of a \u201cPartnership to Advance Clean Energy\u201d. The research and commercial applications carried out through this initiative in just under six years already represent some of the most creative ways two countries can work together. Harkening back to the agroscience cooperation between India and the US that delivered the Green Revolution, joint clean energy research is now under way across collectives of leading labs and research universities in both countries on solar, biofuels and building efficiency. Three US institutions (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Florida and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) have partnered with three leading institutions in India (Indian Institute of Science-Bangalore, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology-Hyderabad, and CEPT University-Ahmedabad) to push ahead on new discoveries in the three fields.\u000a\u000aIndia is also keen to learn from the shale gas experience in the US, as many admire the energy security that it has created. The US Geological Survey carried out a survey of the potential for shale gas discovery in three coastal areas of India (the Bombay, Cauvery and Krishna-Godavari basins), and LNG exports to India have been approved for two sites so far in the US (Cheniere\u2019s Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Dominion Cove Point in Maryland).\u000a\u000aSince 2009, clean energy collaborations have mobilised more than $2 billion in financing \u2014 and that number is quickly rising. This financing has become a key component of the US Export Import (Exim) Bank\u2019s India portfolio, and now appears to be the major focus of US financing announcements at US-India meetings.\u000a\u000aWhen Modi visited Washington last September, the sole big-dollar announcement was a $1 billion memorandum between the US Exim Bank and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) \u2014 for clean energy, naturally. The Republic Day summit has gone even further: the package of $4 billion in financing highlighted by Obama includes $2 billion in US Trade and Development Agency support, $1 billion from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation dedicated solely to clean energy and the earlier $1 billion agreement. That\u2019s a big deal.\u000a\u000aLast, given the clear position of the government of India that the country will not be in a position to make a firm commitment to cap emissions while focused on its economic growth needs \u2014 meaning that no US-India climate agreement will materialise anytime soon \u2014 clean energy has become the most productive, shared way to continue working on the larger climate change question. Joint statements from recent bilateral meetings show how quickly the activities being pursued under the clean energy area have ramped up. Civil nuclear cooperation is now just one example. We also have the smart cities initiatives, off-grid work on clean energy access, a finance forum, energy security consultations and work on power systems, to list just a few.\u000a\u000aFrom a big idea a decade ago focused on finding a way to cooperate on civil nuclear energy, the clean energy piece of the US-India relationship has grown exponentially. This quiet, gradual accumulation of numerous smaller projects has begun to add up to much more than the sum of its parts. As the US and India turn a new corner, elevating ties to a \u201cfriendship\u201d from the previous \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d, the emphasis on shared approaches to prosperity, sustainable development and mitigating climate change comes through strongly. Clean energy cooperation cuts across every area imaginable in meeting those three goals. There will be much more work ahead, but clean energy is an idea whose time has come for this relationship.\u000a\u000aThe writer is senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations.

VUS President Barack Obama\u2019s India visit, which ended on Tuesday, has been the preoccupation of Indian media for many days now, despite the fact that both countries have had several differences in the past, from the nuclear liability law to intellectual property rights. The one point of convergence for both leaders, as expected, was in the green space, with the US committing $125 million for solar energy, boosting energy efficiency and advanced biofuels. To be sure, the US has not always been praised for its commitments to environmental issues. And yet, there are some green ideas that are working for Uncle Sam that India could well draw lessons from. As India looks towards the US for millions of dollars of investment and with it the arrival of king-sized burgers, giant malls, nuclear reactors and all their accompanying health and pollution issues, how about looking at an influx of American ideas that are good for the environment? Here\u2019s a list.\u000a\u000aConversion to renewables: The US is giving an impetus to renewable energy sources like never before. For instance, in 2013, the US added 394 megawatts (MW) of new capacity to produce electricity and all of it came from renewable sources, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Non-governmental organizations like the Solutions Project or the Sierra Club work with provincial governments and institutions to help them achieve the goal of converting to renewables. Then there are states like California where Governor Jerry Brown has announced a grand plan for the state to get at least 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. India has set ambitious targets, but its dependence on fossil fuels is continuing to grow.\u000a\u000aDecommissioning dams: Even as India goes on a dam-building spree, environment groups across the US have launched campaigns to dismantle them. Hundreds of small- and medium-sized dams have already come down. A sign of progress is that the American Society of Civil Engineers is also taking the issue of dam removal seriously by issuing technical guidelines for decommissioning them. The best-known dam decommissioning project is on the Elwha river in Washington state that was built in the 1920s with a combined installed capacity of 19MW. The dams all but wiped out the populations of trout and salmon. Power from the two dams (now within the boundaries of Olympic National Park) was devoted entirely to a pulp and paper mill. In 1992, the Congress directed the interior department for full restoration of the Elwha river ecosystem by decommissioning the project. Now imagine how many ecosystems we could restore in India by decommissioning dams that are choked with heavy siltation and functioning below capacity.\u000a\u000aRetire old and dirty coal-fired power plants: The average\u000a\u000acoal-fired power plant in the US is 42 years old but the oldest, and least efficient, date back to the 1940s and early 1950s. Many of them also lack modern pollution controls and contribute to poor air quality. The Sierra Club, along with many green groups, has been leading a campaign to retire America\u2019s old and dirty coal plants\u201450 of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants accounted for more than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Due to the campaign and working closely with communities and local governments, over 100 such plants have been retired since 2010 that\u2019s led to the prevention of 30,000 asthma attacks and 2,000 premature deaths, saving about $15 billion in healthcare costs.\u000a\u000aFood revolution based on organics: This is a move that has come straight from the White House, and the most vocal voice has been that of First Lady Michelle Obama, who has emphasized the need for fresh, unprocessed, locally grown food. The fanciest restaurants across the Big Apple, for instance, are now supporting the farm-to-plate movement, moving away from food types that are unsustainable to grow. Neighbourhood supermarkets now offer food that hasn\u2019t flown hundreds of miles, that is fresh, organic and even grown on New York\u2019s rooftops and balconies.\u000a\u000aRecovering almost extinct species: Environment groups and scientists have worked hard to bring back species that had almost become extinct, such as the American Bald Eagle, whose numbers have increased from 400 to 10,000 pairs between the 1960s and 2006, the Whooping Crane from 15 in 1941 to 200 in 2005, the Peregrine Falcon from 300 in 1975 to over 2,000 nesting pairs in 2005, and the grizzly bear, which increased from 200 to 500 in the Yellowstone National Park.\u000a\u000aOf course, one must remember that the US, like India, hasn\u2019t always got it right when it comes to green issues from allowing oil drilling in Alaska to encouraging a huge industry of climate naysayers that continue to push for fossil fuels. As the friendship between President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ripens, here\u2019s hoping that we import not just the intense, ugly form of consumerism that the US has stood for in the past, but the\u000a\u000anew-age, eco-friendly and responsible consumerism that is now mushrooming in American neighbourhoods.\u000a\u000aBahar Dutt is a conservation biologist and author of Green Wars: Dispatches from a Vanishing World.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aOver the last 40 years, the world\u2019s cities and towns have seen a sharp rise in heat waves they experience while cold snaps have become more infrequent, according to research just published.\u000a\u000aA team of scientists from India and the U.S, which examined data from 217 urban areas across the globe, found that such prolonged periods of high temperature had increased significantly between 1973 and 2012. The largest number of heat waves had occurred in the most recent decade.\u000a\u000aMoreover, extremely hot days had become significantly more frequent in almost half of those urban areas. Two-thirds of them had to endure more extremely hot nights, reported a paper by Vimal Mishra of IIT-Gandhinagar in Gujarat and the other scientists in Environmental Research Letters.\u000a\u000aThe analysis suggested that urban areas were affected by the warming occurring as a result of climate change as well as the \u2018urban heat island\u2019 effect whereby built-up places trapped heat more than surrounding rural areas, Dr. Mishra told this correspondent.\u000a\u000aHowever, the study also found that although heat waves over urban areas in India had gone up over the 40-year period, the increase was not statistically significant. Similarly, the increase in the number of hot nights was also not significant over India.\u000a\u000aHigh levels of fine particles in the atmosphere (known as aerosols), which reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, may be partly responsible for a slower rate of warming over this country, Dr. Mishra said.\u000a\u000aOver half the world\u2019s population already lived in urban agglomerations, which were centres of wealth and infrastructure as well, he pointed out. It was therefore important to understand how such places would be affected by a changing climate and climatic extremes.\u000a\u000a\u201cVulnerability of mega cities is clearly something to worry about,\u201d remarked Raghu Murtugudde of the University of Maryland in the U.S., who was not involved in the study, in an email. \u201cWhile they are typically hotspots of innovation, are they also growing to be hotspots for the worst of climate impacts?\u201d

VThe FM should supplement his budgetary proposals on energy with broad initiatives. `\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath of the Republic Day India-US summit and against the backdrop of global warming and weak oil prices, what rabbits must the finance minister pull out of his hat to lend credence to the pronouncements made by the prime minister last week and persuade investors that feasible action will match lofty rhetoric? This article responds to that question with specific reference to energy.\u000a\u000aThe PM told the business leaders gathered to hear him and US President Barack Obama that his objective was not simply to push India up the rank order in the \u201cease of doing business\u201d index but to make it the \u201ceasiest business environment in the world\u201d. He said that he would personally monitor major projects and that \u201cspeed\u201d along with \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cskill\u201d would be the tripod on which the government would facilitate investment. The minister of state for commerce and industry made a comparably absolute remark in her introductory address. She said India had already the most liberal economic terms for foreign direct investment.\u000a\u000aThe CEOs must, no doubt, have been pleased. They may have wondered at the feasibility of such a grandiloquent commitment, but not at the sincerity of the PM\u2019s conviction. But now, with the settling of the summit dust, they are asking the question: How will the government cut through the thicket of regulatory procedures, discretionary authority and vested interests that make it so difficult to do business? Will it move forward incrementally, with a focus on cleaning up the mess left behind by the previous government, or will it forge a radically different path? The former may improve our rank order in the business index but it won\u2019t move us to the top of the list. The latter may also not get us top billing, but it would leapfrog us into a significantly higher quartile. The answer will be searched for in the fine print of the budget, for it is the next big economic occasion.\u000a\u000aThe Republic Day summit has focused attention on clean energy, technology and global warming. The civil nuclear deal has been reinvigorated and this should expedite the generation of nuclear energy. Solar and wind power have been provided a fillip with a $4 billion financial package though various US agencies. And though there was no agreement to cap greenhouse gas emissions a la the US-China agreement and the PM did not dilute the government\u2019s official stand that individual countries bear \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d to mitigate and adapt to global warming, there was enough in the interstices of the public statements to infer that India and the US might well find common ground before the forthcoming Paris summit on climate change. The PM did, for instance, make clear that it was in our national interest to push the economy onto a low-carbon growth trajectory.\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, it would be a surprise if the FM did not dedicate a long paragraph on clean energy in his budget speech. The expectation is that he will look to deliver a robust and holistic package of fiscal incentives, subsidies, duty structure rationalisation and low-cost financing to support renewables and clean energy technology. And that these proposals, while building on the incentives that are already in place (that is, accelerated depreciation for wind power, feed-in tariffs for solar, renewable power obligations and subsidies for electric vehicles), will be significantly more attractive. I hope this expectation is realised for it may otherwise be difficult to deliver even a small percentage of the government\u2019s aspirational target of 100 gigawatt (GW) of solar (current 2.5 GW) and 50 GW of wind (current 26 GW) power by 2022, especially given that the drop in oil prices has raised the bar on the competitiveness of renewables.\u000a\u000aThe FM should, of course, go beyond this paragraph. Three hard facts have a direct bearing on the nexus between economic development, energy demand and environmental protection. The nature of this nexus and its consequences must also be addressed. First, India will remain dependent on coal, oil and gas for years to come, even if technological development reduces the costs of solar, wind and bio to grid parity. This is because it takes time and money to overhaul an existing energy system. Thomas Edison illuminated lower Manhattan in the 1880s, but it was not until the mid-1930s that US manufacturing switched fully from steam power to electric power. It could not do so earlier because the factories were not appropriately designed. Most had to be reconfigured, some totally rebuilt. A similar situation faces India. Its energy system is built around fossil fuels. To create a new system with sufficient scale and geographic coverage around renewables will take decades, and $100 billion.\u000a\u000aSecond, billions have been wiped off the balance sheets of energy companies because of the slide in oil prices. They do not have the investible surplus to invest in high risk, high cost exploration ventures. India will not, then, find it easy to attract international risk capital. Third, coal will remain the bulwark of the energy sector. The minister of power has, for instance, set himself the goal of doubling coal production from the current 500 million tonnes to 1 billion tonnes by the end of this decade. Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, so this target will not sit comfortably with the goal of decarbonisation.\u000a\u000aIn the face of these truths, the FM should supplement his budgetary proposals on energy with two broad initiatives. The first should be directed towards accelerating the use of gas. This is because gas is the most environmentally benign of fossil fuels. It is cheaper than oil and now, with spot LNG prices hovering around $9 per million British thermal units (mmbtu), which converts to a variable cost of around Rs 4 per kilowatt hour for power utilities, it is affordable. And it is in relative abundance in the region. The second should look to encourage investment in technologies that \u201cgreen\u201d fossil fuels and limit emissions levels.\u000a\u000aSpecifically with regard to gas, the FM should impose a \u201cgas power obligation\u201d on distribution companies. This would require them to purchase a certain percentage of their power requirements from gas-based generators. He should also accord infrastructure status to investment in the creation of a national pipeline grid and conjoin the routing of this grid (or at least a part of it) to the national highway programme, so as to expedite the substitution of the more-expensive diesel for CNG. And with regard to \u201cgreen\u201d technology, he should incentivise Coal India and other operators to deploy technologies like coal gasification and combine with academics, laboratories and research institutions to develop and deploy methods to capture and sequester carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aThe PM has raised expectations of a radically reformist budget. The FM must not disappoint. On energy, the route is clear. Policies have to be put in place that \u201cgreen\u201d our current fossil fuel-dominated energy basket and, at the same time, build the foundations for a non-fossil fuel energy future.\u000a\u000aThe writer is executive chairman of Brookings India, and senior fellow, the Brookings Institution\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VWASHINGTON: President Barack Obama 's fiscal 2016 budget proposes $7.4 billion to fund clean energy technologies and a $4-billion fund to encourage US states to make faster and deeper cuts to emissions from power plants, officials told Reuters.Obama's budget, which will be published later on Monday, also calls for the permanent extension of the production tax credit, used by the wind industry, and the investment tax credit, used by the solar industry, the officials said. Obama has made fighting climate change a top priority in his final two years in office. The White House sees it as critical to his legacy.The investment in clean energy technologies would cover programs primarily at the department of energy and department of defense , the officials said.The $7.4-billion figure is an increase from the $6.9 billion proposed in Obama's fiscal 2015 budget and over the $6.5 billion enacted by Congress for this year.The administration is finalising controversial rules that will slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants nationwide. The new fund would give states incentives to speed up that process or go further than their mandated cuts, the officials said."They have the opportunity to really ... set their sights higher and lock into an even more ambitious trajectory when it comes to clean energy," one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the budget's formal release.States could qualify for the funding by making their targets early or going further than required. They would then have access to money that could be used to finance clean energy technologies, funding for low-income communities that face "disproportionate impacts from environmental pollution" and create incentives for businesses to back projects that cut down on carbon emissions, blamed for global warming.In addition, the budget provides $400 million to help communities assess flood risks.It also spells out the costs to the federal government of climate-related disasters, highlighting a fiscal argument to fight global warming. The United States has taken on over $300 billion in direct costs resulting from extreme weather and fire in the past decade, the budget says.

VUS President Barack Obama\u2019s recent trip to India was full of atmospherics. The nuclear deal is being hailed as the one substantive accomplishment. It certainly is a step forward especially since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had opposed the Bush-Singh nuclear accord. But whether the insurance pool created by the four public sector insurance companies with a matching contribution by the Union government and a legal opinion of the attorney general to reinterpret the nuclear liability legislation passed by Parliament in September 2010 (\u201cThe Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010\u201d) will break the stalemate remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aIronically, it was the BJP that had insisted on some provisions that it now finds \u201ccumbersome\u201d for suppliers. The reinterpretation is to give \u201ccomfort\u201d to US companies that liability in case of accidents will not only be capped, but also be confined just to the operator of the plant and not extend to the suppliers as well\u2014as provided for in the 2010 law. India had signed on to the 1997 international Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) in October 2010 itself and has held firm to the view that its domestic nuclear liability law is in conformity with it. But the US has been insisting that our law has to be changed to bring it in line with its interpretation of the CSC. India still needs a formal decision by the Union cabinet to ratify and deposit the instrument of ratification with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This should now get done irrespective of what the US says.\u000a\u000aAlthough the US has not commissioned a nuclear reactor for well over three-and-a-half decades, two American companies GE and Westinghouse (with their Japanese partners Hitachi and Toshiba, respectively) have plans for setting up nuclear power plants\u2014GE in Andhra Pradesh and Westinghouse in Gujarat. Their initial reaction has naturally been cautious and circumspect since the finer details of the deal have not yet been made public. But even assuming that their reaction later is that the liability issue has been settled to their satisfaction, there is no cause for great celebration. In fact, it is then that hard-nosed negotiations will actually begin and these could drag on for quite some time on cost and regulatory issues as well.\u000a\u000aEven though environmental clearance was granted in November 2010 with tough compliance conditions, negotiations with French company Areva for the supply of six 1,650 megawatt (MW) reactors have been going on for over four-and-a-half years. Capital costs (and thereby cost of power generated) have proved to be a hugely contentious issue. There is no reason to believe that negotiations with the American companies will be any different. India certainly needs to increase its nuclear power generating capacity substantially since nuclear power plants emit no greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that cause global warming or gases like sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide that have a deleterious effect on human health. But whether imports of reactors from France, Russia and the US are indeed the most cost-effective way to increase such capacity is a question that needs to be addressed seriously especially since the country is installing standardized 700MW heavy-water reactors that have been designed and developed indigenously. The capital costs of the French, American and Russian reactors could end up being at least three-four times those of the indigenously developed reactors. There has also been vociferous local opposition to the location of these plants at Jaitapur in Maharashtra in the case of Areva, Mithi Virdi in Gujarat in the case of Westinghouse, and Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh in the case of GE. These agitations have to be understood and dealt with as part of the democratic process and not be painted as being \u201canti-national\u201d and instigated by forces inimical to India\u2019s development.\u000a\u000aOn climate, too, there is exultation that India has been let off quite lightly and that it has not had to sign a bilateral agreement like the Chinese did when President Obama was in Beijing last December. But has it? In his \u201ctown hall\u201d speech just before leaving, President Obama had this to say: \u201cI know the argument made by some that it\u2019s unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century. But here\u2019s the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India\u2014with soaring energy needs\u2014don\u2019t also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don\u2019t stand a chance against climate change.\u201d What he said was that while India has not contributed to the \u201cstock\u201d of emissions, it is a major contributor to the \u201cflow\u201d.\u000a\u000aPresident Obama certainly did not demand for our emissions to peak, which the Chinese have pledged. He knows that China\u2019s emissions, the highest in the world, are over four times those of India and that the two cannot really be equated. But this does not mean that India can get away lightly. India is key to arriving at a global climate agreement in Paris later this year in December. Paris will certainly not meet all environmental expectations but will at least provide a springboard to move to a low-carbon growth path. Countries are not being imposed \u201ctop-down\u201d targets or commitments but are submitting \u201ccontributions\u201d based on their \u201cnational circumstances\u201d. But having done so, if countries do not agree to an international system of monitoring, reporting and verification even if it be non-punitive, then there is really no meaningful outcome from Paris. And it is here that India has been playing its usual negative role with great skill. President Obama\u2019s parting remarks indicate that the international community is looking to India eagerly to unveil its detailed roadmap for low-carbon growth that goes well beyond announcing ambitious targets for solar and wind energy.\u000a\u000aThe author is a former Union minister and Rajya Sabha MP.

VNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India has the potential to lead the world in the domain of renewable energy, describing the narrowing difference between the cost of solar and conventional energy as a "game changer" for the sector.At the inauguration of a three day global conference, RE-Invest 2015, Modi on Sunday described the thrust on renewable energy production as an effort to ensure universal energy access for India's poor. He said the price of solar energy has tumbled from Rs 20 a unit to Rs 7, bringing it close to conventional power. He recalled that as Gujarat chief minister he persisted with the solar power programme even as people found it scandalous that it was generated at Rs 20 a unit, but added that prices started falling as the industry scaled up. "Now prices are in the direction of conventional electricity. This is a game changer," he said."We have always spoken of energy in terms of megawatt. It is the first time we're talking of gigawatt. We have no option but to make a quantum leap in energy production and connectivity," Modi said, addressing a gathering of 2,000 delegates from India and 40 other countries.In November last year, the government set an ambitious target of setting up 170 gigawatt of wind, solar and biomass power projects by 2022. Modi talked about India working to evolve an alliance of about 50 countries with abundant sunshine to pool research and technological advancements in the field of solar energy with an aim to make power accessible to the poorest of the poor and in remotest locations. He also said that India's stress on renewable energy is not aimed at impressing the world but to meet its own energy requirements.The prime minister stressed on the need for local equipment manufacturing for clean energy projects to generate jobs and technological innovation. Modi's stress on equipment manufacture in India is linked to his 'Make in India' campaign, through which he wants to boost local manufacture to create jobs for people.The conference is aimed at engaging different stakeholders in developing renewable energy in the country and attracting investments of more than $100 billion (over Rs 6 lakh crore) in the sector.India has just 33 gigawatt of clean energy capacity at present, with 22 gigawatt from wind, about 3,000 megawatt from solar energy and the remaining from small hydro and biomass projects.India's total power generation capacity is more than 250,000 mw. Most of the electricity is generated from coal-fired power plants.

VNEW DELHI: The ministry of environment, forests and climate change has put tax breaks and fiscal concessions for instruments that measure and help abate pollution at the top of its wish list for the upcoming Union Budget. Tackling air and water pollution tops the green ministry's priorities and it wants the finance minister to make pollution abatement a less expensive proposition for industry and civic bodies to do so.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"We want facilities, particularly instruments to abate pollution shouldn\u2019t become expensive," a government official said. Sources said that the environment ministry has suggested that instruments and other components required for reducing air and water pollution "should be made cheaper". The environment ministry has made it mandatory for all industries to implement a zero liquid discharge policy by March 31 to minimize the flow of untreated into water bodies and rivers. Industrial units have also been told to put in place the requisite instrumentation for measuring air-borne pollutants. While the ministry has been firm, industry has been raising the question of costs. The environment ministry's suggestion to limit taxes on pollution abatement and measurement equipment is to ensure costs don't hinder.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe government's intent is to move away from the command and control model of addressing pollution. While it would mean fewer inspectors, environment minister Prakash Javadekar has consistently maintained that monitoring and compliance will be central for the administration of environmental laws and regulations. The pollution control boards too will need to upgrade its monitoring and measuring capabilities. Lower costs for measuring pollution will help roll out a rigorous and robust system of assessing the levels of pollution and for better monitoring. It will also help roll out the partnership that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama agreed on to help India address urban air pollution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"More money for the National Adaptation Fund (to address the impacts of climate change) is another ask on the ministry's wishlist," the official said. The ministry wants the finance minister to increase allocation for the fund, which was created in July, to help improve the ability of vulnerable communities to address adverse impacts of climate change. The new fund was capitalised with a budgetary allocation of Rs 100 crore, however, there is a need for much higher quantum of funds given the need to help building resilience of poor communities against climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VIndia's first global conference for renewable energy, the RE-Invest 2015, began on Sunday with participation of some noted names in India Inc, financiers and state representatives.\u000a\u000a(PSUs) and the private sector made 2.9-Gw of green energy commitment.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who inaugurated the conference, declared "India has now graduated from megawatts to gigawatts in terms of production."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe made a strong pitch to make renewable sources like solar and wind power affordable. "In this age of globalisation, we have no option but to make a quantum leap in energy production and connectivity," said Modi. "Fruits of development will not reach the common man until energy connectivity reaches every last household of the country."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe prime minister asserted that India's stress on was not aimed at impressing the world but to meet the people's energy requirements.\u000a\u000aHe also said India was working on building a consortium of 50 countries with abundant solar radiation, to pool research and technological advancements in an attempt to ensure power reaches remote areas.\u000a\u000aReferring to the "seven horses of energy", the prime minister said: "So far, India has focused on thermal, gas, hydro and nuclear power. But now we need to add solar energy, wind energy and biomass energy." About 60 per cent of India's electricity comes through coal.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister also gave awards to 12 states for their outstanding contribution to Besides, 27 public sector companies, including and State Bank of India, handed over to the Prime Minister their "Green Energy Commitment Certificates".\u000a\u000aCoal, Power and Renewable Energy Minister said the first renewable energy global conference would usher a cleaner, brighter and energy-secure India. He has been pushing for widespread adoption of clean energy technology since taking charge.\u000a\u000aTo promote the evacuation of renewable energy, Goyal said breaching renewable purchase obligations will soon draw penalties. "New renewable energy policy will be enacted soon and would also have provision for renewable generation obligation. There is a need to socialise the cost of renewable energy (RE) through participation of all states, because currently only the states pushing for RE are bearing the burden," said Goyal.\u000a\u000aReposing investors' confidence again in the renewable energy sector, Goyal said this meet would certainly play an important role "as we move towards energy security". The event was chaired by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian and was attended by SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, HSBC India chief Naina Lal Kidwai, board member of US EXIM Bank Patricia Loui and other key Indian and global business representatives.

VNEW DELHI: Proposals such as creation of a national infrastructure investment fund and doubling of coal cess in the Union Budget have buoyed the renewable energy industry, which believes these steps could help solve financing challenges, thereby boosting clean energy projects."...as environmental degradation hurts the poor more than others, we are committed to make our development process as green as possible," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said during his Budget speech.He emphasised on achieving the 1,75,000-megawatt target set for clean energy installations by 2022. This would comprise 1,00,000 MW of solar power , 60,000 MW of wind power, 10,000 MW of energy from biomass and 5,000 MW from small hydroelectric projects. Currently, India's clean energy capacity is 33,000 MW.Jaitley envisioned providing electricity by 2020 to the remaining 20,000 villages that still don\u2019t have access to electricity, including through off-grid solar power.Although there weren't any sector-specific sops, industry players do not consider it as a major concern."The national investment and infrastructure fund will prove to be a game-changer for the renewable energy sector,\u201d said Vineet Mittal, co-founder and managing director of Welspun Energy . \u201cIt is also good to allow foreign investments in alternative investment funds.\u201dThe Budget proposed creation of a national investment and infrastructure fund and finding monies to ensure an annual flow of Rs 20,000 crore into it. The money thus raised can be invested in infrastructure finance companies.Welspun's Mittal said increasing coal cess to Rs 200 a tonne from Rs 100 will be helpful for sustaining subsidies to clean energy projects.The minister proposed a programme for faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles. "I am proposing an initial outlay of Rs 75 crore for this scheme in 2015-16," he said.Meanwhile, experts note that unlike rail and roads, tax-free bonds have not been specifically proposed for renewable energy. Given this, any funds to the sector from tax-free debt will now have to come out of the general pool of infrastructure bonds. Also, proposals for the utilisation of funds from the increased coal cess are yet to be spelt out.\u201cIt would have been better to propose specific allocations and measures for renewable energy, especially on availability of low-cost funds for the renewable energy sector,\u201d said Anish De, partner, infrastructure and government services at consultancy firm KPMG The Economic Survey 2014-15, released on Friday, said India\u2019s clean energy sector was likely to generate business opportunities of $160 billion in the next five years.

VIn the backdrop of US President Barack Obama\u2019s recent visit to India and the much talked about Paris Cop21 (the 21st session of the conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), clean energy has found a much-needed noticeable voice on a global platform. Countries across the world are taking note and making smarter decisions. Walking the talk, finance minister Arun Jaitley has taken a stride in this direction in the budget for fiscal year 2015-16. Overall, this is a good budget for the corporate sector but its more directional and we\u2019ll wait to see the fine print. It has a positive thrust on infrastructure and is very good for the financial sector and the real estate sector.\u000a\u000aClimate change and the alarming hike in carbon emissions is every individual\u2019s worry. India needs to bring down carbon emissions to acceptable global standards. The radical effects of climate change are already being witnessed with unfathomable tragedies. From the Uttrakhand cloudburst to the blizzard in New York, climate change is here today. We need to address the situation now with clean energy solutions.\u000a\u000aOur intellectually honest, reformist government has foresight. With a developmental agenda, the government identified the need to take environmental caution into consideration and has set targets for renewable sources of energy. The Economic Survey addresses our fight related to climate change. According to the Economic Survey report authored by Arvind Subramanian, the government\u2019s chief economic advisor, the government plans to scale up total renewable capacity to 170 gigawatts (GW) from 33.8 GW. Our finance minister reiterated the point in his budget speech. As part of this renewable energy plan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has planned to increase the capacity of solar energy fivefold to 100 GW by 2022.\u000a\u000aThe overall industry stands to gain from several announcements in the budget, be it the deferred general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) for two years or lowered corporate tax from 30% to 25% over the next four years. Setting up committees for public debt management, and the proposal for a monetary policy committee will also have a positive effect. Holding companies for public sector banks is also a credible move. And above all, the clarity on the goods and services tax (GST) is much appreciated. Although, I would have liked to see more on the fiscal deficit trajectory. Concrete steps to address the revenue deficit, which would affect India\u2019s sovereign rating and, in turn, the cost of foreign funds, would have been welcome.\u000a\u000aAs our minister spoke about 8-8.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth, he also hinted his aspiration to achieving double-digit GDP in the coming years. He clearly understands the need for the Centre to spend on infrastructure, thereby increasing the outlay to Rs.70,000 crore. He ingeniously proposed another Rs.20,000 crore to set up a national investment infra fund. This could be leveraged several times over to achieve significant impact. He spoke about tax-free bonds in rail, road and irrigation sectors. I would wish to see renewable energy included as one of the beneficiaries of the infra fund as well as the tax-free bonds. REIT tax clarity is also a positive move, with the assumption that the same would be there for infra investment trusts.\u000a\u000aThe coal cess is doubled to Rs.200 and will give the exchequer more than Rs.10,000 crore. I would urge the minister to use these funds obtained from dirty energy for generation of clean energy, especially since he has announced five ultra mega power projects of 4GW.\u000a\u000aWith these announcements in the budget, the government has lent an aggressive support to its agenda and initiatives. Although on renewables, per se, a lot more should have been done. Announcements on plans to address transmission, distribution, giving visibility for funds for the renewable sector, along with long-term funds such as pension funds, EPFO or even some support pool for foreign exchange hedging would have made it a dream budget.\u000a\u000aThis single focused target of green energy achievement shall provide multiple solutions to our problems\u2014environment, health, basic amenities and an improved standard of living in a Swachh Bharat, with swachh hawa (clean air). With a 2022 timeline, there is an automated accountability format in place. The road map is created. Solutions for a better India; a better planet. We are on the threshold of change.\u000a\u000aRahul Munjal is managing director at Hero Future Energies.

VNew Delhi: The government on Saturday proposed to raise levies on greenhouse gas-emitting coal, a move that will increase electricity tariffs while strengthening India\u2019s position at upcoming global climate change negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cI propose to increase the clean energy cess from Rs.100 to Rs.200 per tonne of coal, etc. to finance clean environment initiatives,\u201d finance minister Arun Jaitley announced in his budget speech.\u000a\u000aThe cess, which applies to coal mined in India as well as imported coal, will result in a tariff increase of 4-6 paise per unit.\u000a\u000aThis comes in the backdrop of India working on a plan to reduce borrowing costs and improve the viability of solar and wind power projects by extending hedging support for foreign loans, leveraging the National Clean Energy Fund.\u000a\u000aIndia, the world\u2019s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is among the few countries in the world to have introduced a carbon tax. Of India\u2019s installed power generation capacity of 255,681.46 megawatts (MW), around 60%, or 154,170.89MW, is coal-based. The cess at current levels aggregates to Rs.6,000 crore every year.\u000a\u000aWith mining activity expected to pick up in the country after the coalfield auctions, the annual collection is expected to substantially increase.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlso, for the 75th year of independence, there will be 60 million houses to be built. These houses will have 24x7 electricity\u2014this will give a huge boost to the electricity sector consumption. Coupled with a push for Make in India, going forward the demand for electricity will grow in excess of 7% per annum,\u201d said Debasish Mishra, senior director, consulting at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Pvt. Ltd.\u000a\u000aIndia has substantially revised an earlier solar energy target of achieving 20,000MW of capacity by 2022 to 100,000MW. It plans to put in place 60,000MW of wind power capacity by then. While India has set up a green energy target of 1,75,000MW by 2022, green energy has a share of 12.42%, or 31,692.14MW. The country\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change recommends that the nation generate 10% of its power from solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources by 2015 and 15% by 2020.\u000a\u000aHowever, some analysts were not impressed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe general emphasis on renewable energy and re-stating of the MNRE (ministry of new and renewable energy) target to 175GW by 2022, comprising 100GW of solar, 60GW of wind and 15GW of other technologies is not adequate to make capacity creation happen in reality. Prima facie, we have not seen any concrete measures in the budget for renewable energy. Unlike rail and roads, tax-free bonds have not been specifically proposed for renewable energy,\u201d said Anish De, partner, infrastructure and government services, KPMG.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven this, any funds from tax-free bonds will now have to come out of the general pool of infrastructure bonds. Also, the proposals for the utilization of funds from the increased coal cess are yet to be spelt out. It would have been better to propose specific allocations and measures for renewable energy, especially on availability of low cost funds for the renewable energy sector,\u201d De said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe intent to drive new investment in generation through 20GW UMPP and 175GW of renewable energy by 2022 is welcome and necessary, but to continue to attract investors its necessary to revive the distribution sector and its ability to pay,\u201d added Kameswara Rao, leader energy, utilities and mining at PwC India.\u000a\u000aIncreased cess collection\u000a\u000aAs part of its strategy to garner additional resources in the backdrop of higher devolution to the states through the 14th finance commission, the government increased the road cess on petrol and diesel from Rs.2 per litre to Rs.6 per litre. Cess and surcharges are not shared with the states.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese include conversion of existing excise duty on petrol and diesel to the extent of Rs.4 per litre into road cess to fund investment in roads and other infrastructure,\u201d Jaitley said. This will lead to the availability of Rs.40,000 crore for these sectors.\u000a\u000a\u201cBasic excise duty rates on petrol and diesel are also being increased suitably so as to subsume education cess and secondary and higher education cess presently levied on them,\u201d Jaitley added.\u000a\u000aIn keeping with the National Democratic Alliance government\u2019s repeated articulation of what it calls cooperative federalism, the state\u2019s share of revenue has been increased to 42% of net tax receipts of the central government.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is also proposed to have an enabling provision to levy Swachh Bharat cess at a rate of 2% or less on all or certain services if need arises. This cess will be effective from a date to be notified. Resources generated from this cess will be utilised for financing and promoting initiatives towards Swachh Bharat,\u201d Jaitley added.\u000a\u000aPower to all\u000a\u000aAs part of the government\u2019s energy security efforts, the finance minister announced setting up five new ultra mega power projects (UMPPs) at an investment of Rs.1 trillion. UMPPs are India\u2019s attempt to create large power generation capacities at a single location. It has had its share of problems, weighed by ecological concerns and local resistance.\u000a\u000aUMPPs follow competitive tariff-based bidding, and special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are set up to reduce risk perception and to increase investor confidence. These SPVs take care of regulatory requirements such as land acquisition and environmental clearance, and transfer these to the winning bidder. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had plans to set up 16 UMPPs, but only four have been awarded\u2014at Mundra in Gujarat, Sasan in Madhya Pradesh, Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Tilaiya in Jharkhand.\u000a\u000aThis comes in the backdrop of 300 million Indians lacking access to electricity with per-capita electricity consumption being one-fourth of the world\u2019s average.\u000a\u000a\u201cElectrification, by 2020, of the remaining 20,000 villages in the country, including by off-grid solar power generation,\u201d Jaitley promised.\u000a\u000aIndia has taken significant steps to eliminate oil subsidies and has gone beyond to impose taxes on petroleum products, taking it from a carbon subsidization regime to one of carbon taxation.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs environmental degradation hurts the poor more than others, we are committed to make our development process as green as possible. Our de facto \u2018carbon tax\u2019 on most petroleum products compares favourably with international norms. With regard to coal, there is a need to find a balance between taxing pollution, and the price of power. However, beginning this year, I intend to start on that journey too,\u201d Jaitley said.

VNEW DELHI: Emphasising the need to generate more electricity from clean energy sources, the government today announced a massive renewable power production target of 1,75,000 mw in the next seven years.Of the total 1,75,000 mw proposed to be tapped by 2022, solar power will have a lion's share of 1,00,000 mw followed by 60,000 mw from wind energy , 10,000 mw biomass energy and 5,000 mw of small hydro projects, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in his Budgetary proposals.At present, the solar power generation capacity of the country is about 3,000 mw.Small hydro power projects are plants with up to 25 mw generation capacity.The Finance Minister said the power sector had witnessed rapid growth due to efforts of the government despite uncertainty on the coal front.Besides it had launched ambitious programmes for new and renewable energy , he said.Power, Coal and New and Renewable Energy Minister Piyush Goyal had said the country's renewable energy sector is looking to attract USD 200 billion in investments as several domestic and international firms have evinced interest in tapping the potential of green power.At present, renewable energy contributes about 6.5 per cent to the electricity mix. It is proposed that this would be taken to about 12 per cent in the next three years.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aWith increased coal energy cess, ambitious renewable energy targets, and sops for electric vehicles, the Union Budget hopes to generate investment in green energy while giving short shrift to forest and wildlife, to the dismay of environmentalists.\u000a\u000aThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has revised its renewable energy target for 2022 to 1,75,000 MW, comprising 100,000 MW solar, 60,000 MW wind, 10,000 MW biomass and 5000 MW small hydro.\u000a\u000aOf the budget of Rs.1,681 crore allocated for the Ministry of Environment, Rs.160 crore has been allocated to the Mission on Climate Change and Adaptation, with Rs.135 crore of that going to the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change. The National Mission on Himalayan studies has been allocated Rs.100 crore. There has been a big push for prevention and control of pollution, with an allocation of Rs.240.30 crore, which is way above the Rs.96.77 crore allocated last year.\u000a\u000aFormer National Board of Wildlife Standing Committee member Kishore Rithe said that 50 Tiger Reserves would get merely Rs.136.46 crore (as opposed to Rs.161 crore last year) and the budget allocation to wildlife and forest has been reduced.\u000a\u000aDuring 2014-15, around Rs.545.62 crore was allocated for wildlife conservation which has been brought down to Rs.299.39 crore which is insufficient to manage wildlife in more than 650 protected areas in India, he added.\u000a\u000aOfficial sources said the Centre\u2019s contribution in some areas of the Ministry of Environment would come down since funds are devolved to the States but overall there is not much of a cut as compared to last year\u2019s revised budget estimates of Rs.1,764.60 crore.\u000a\u000aThe government is launching a scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) with an initial outlay of Rs.75 crore in 2015-16. The concessions from customs and excise duties currently available on specified parts for manufacture of electrically operated vehicles and hybrid vehicles are being extended by one more year i.e. up to March 31, 2016.\u000a\u000aThe government also proposes to electrify by 2020 the remaining 20,000 villages in the country, including by off-grid solar power generation.

Four Indian airports are participating in airport carbon accreditation," he said.

VThe Budget proposals for 2015-16 has no strategy in place to address green concerns, the Centre of Science and Environment (CSE) said, adding that the only \u201cgreen initiative\u201d of the Narendra Modi government is the increase in cess on coal - from Rs 100 to Rs200/tonne - which is inadequate to cut emission.\u000a\u000a\u201cA five-fold increase in the cess would equalise price of domestic coal with international prices and would contribute to annual CO{-2}emission reduction of 214 million tonne, which is 11 per cent of India\u2019s annual emissions. However, in budget 2015, the Finance Minister has opted to take the slow road and has doubled the cess on coal to balance the need to tax pollution and the price of power in his words,\u201d Sunita Narain, CSE director, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aNarain said to ensure that people move away from private to public transport, there should be adequate investment in infrastructure \u201cto wean us away from cars\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is bad is that Budget 2015 is doing the reverse. It says it will set aside Rs 4 per litre of the excise duty on petrol and diesel for a dedicated road cess. This tunnel vision of viewing infrastructure for transport as just \u201croads\u201d is regressive. Instead, the need is to reinvent mobility so that it moves goods and people, and not vehicles,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aCSE said the Finance Minister said nothing about reducing air pollution except promotion of electric vehicles. \u201cThis is not going to make a dent in the pollution levels in the next 10 years at least. He had no proposal on improving our vehicle emissions control technologies or taxing polluting big diesel SUVs, promoting public transport or improving fuel quality. These are the most basic things that we will have to do to clean the air in our cities\u201d, CSE said.\u000a\u000aWhile welcoming the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 100 per cent rebate for contributions apart from a Swachh Bharat cess at a rate of 2 per cent or less on all or certain services, CSE said the Finance Minister should have announced something on garbage management.\u000a\u000aPointing out that funds of Environment and New and Renewable Energy Ministries had been cut, CSE said there was a mismatch between the intentions expressed in the Budget speech and allocations. The Finance Minister mentioned a massive increase in renewable energy capacity of 1,75,000 MW to be achieved by 2022, but this year allocation for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has actually been reduced by about 7 per cent against last year. The budget for the Ministry of Environment, too, has been cut by 15 per cent from 2014-15 levels, CSE added.

VThe FY16 Budget is sensible, pragmatic, inclusive and, in some respects, innovative and growth-oriented. The finance minister has addressed almost all of the issues that have exercised society over the last few months. And he has done so without flourish, populism or indeed a \u201cbig bang\u201d announcement. This said, I need to enter a caveat. I was disappointed that the finance minister did not dedicate at least a few sentences to the importance of weakening the linkage between economic growth, energy demand and the environment.\u000a\u000aConsider the following situation. The minister of power succeeds in achieving his objective of doubling coal production from the current 500 million tonnes to 1 billion tonnes by the end of this decade (in a post-Budget TV interview, he talked of trebling production); the current rate of migration from villages to cities continues unabated and the urban population will increase from 300 million today to 600 million in 2020. The bulk of this population are young with a median-age of 25. They want to trade up from a cycle to a motorised vehicle. Two-wheeler and auto manufacturers capitalise on this aspirational demand and record increasing sales and profitability. With no substantive substitute, this leads to surging demand for petrol and diesel.\u000a\u000aNow, consider the consequences of this situation. The urban Indian gets dangerously exposed to the carcinogenic particulates emitted by vehicular traffic. Already she is suffering. The number of deaths from respiratory illness and asthma in India is the highest in the world.\u000a\u000aAccording to Professor Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago, the life expectancy of the 600 million people in urban India will reduce by a further 3.2 years. Furthermore, much of our forest cover gets denuded. This is because a large proportion of our coal reserves are in richly-forested areas and these are cleared to achieve the ministers\u2019 ambitious target. Finally, India emerges as the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and a large number of the thermal power plants run on outdated and inefficient technology. The government\u2019s seeming lack of commitment to move onto a low-carbon trajectory growth path undermines its standing in multilateral discussions on arresting global warming and climate change.\u000a\u000aThe finance minister spelt out his vision in clear and measured language. It was focused on securing economic growth, distributive equity and social justice. It would have sounded more complete had he acknowledged the conflictual trade-off between the need for energy and the imperative of environmental protection and sought to address this conflict within the larger frame of his vision. He did have a slew of proposals but they were presented in a somewhat disconnected manner. Thus, the decision to double the cess on coal from R100 per tonne to R200 per tonne to fund the \u201cclean energy fund\u201d made no mention of R&D and innovation in clean energy. Perhaps this was deemed self-explanatory, but given that in the past the money in this fund has not been used for this purpose, the finance minister would have done well to make explicit the connection. In the same vein, he made mention of a carbon tax but he did not make clear how and where he intended to apply it. He reiterated the government\u2019s intent to substantially increase the generation of electricity from solar and wind, but without providing a roadmap for its practical implementation.\u000a\u000aOver and above these matters of presentation, the green energy agenda fell short on four issues of substance.\u000a\u000aOne, the finance minister made no mention of natural gas. This, despite the fact that gas is the cleanest of all fossil fuels\u2014gas-based power plants emit 50% less carbon-dioxide than coal-based units\u2014and that 20 GW of generation capacity has not been operationalised because of inadequate gas supplies and poor pipeline infrastructure. The finance minister should have acknowledged the significance of gas and announced that investment in pipelines would receive the same tax benefits as other major infrastructural investment.\u000a\u000aTwo, the finance minister did not elaborate on the support that the solar and wind energy sector would require to increase solar energy capacity from the current 2.5 GW to over 100 GW by 2020 and wind energy from 22.5 GW to 50 GW by 2030. This should have been done to respond to critics who believe this is an unattainable target. These critics have a point. To achieve this goal, the government will have to add an incremental 19 GW of solar and 6 GW of wind annually. Hitherto, they have logged an average increment of 1-1.5 GW annually. Thus, in the absence of a fuller explanation on the roadmap for execution, this announcement can be justifiably seen as no more than a populist flourish.\u000a\u000aThree, the finance minister allocated only R75 crore for invigorating the electric vehicle (EV) market. EVs (cars and cycles) are the answer to sustainable mobility. They have not taken off in India because of high upfront costs, delays in the disbursement of subsidies and erratic power supply. But the costs are coming down; battery-storage capacity has been enhanced by technological developments; Indian companies are interested and the inter-ministerial turf battles that in the past delayed subsidy disbursement have reduced. The finance minister should have leveraged these positives to give EVs a stronger fillip rather than hold out what, at first glance, looks like a fig leaf.\u000a\u000aFinally, and perhaps most significant, there is the issue of the sanction of five ultra-mega thermal plants. Other than the passing reference to carbon tax, his speech contained nothing to ameliorate the concerns of the environmentalists.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the Budget\u2019s fine-print will show that my concerns are exaggerated and the finance minister is indeed cognisant of the longer-term ramifications of neglecting the environmental implications of an energy system grounded on fossil fuels. Certainly, the Prime Minister has expressed his concern by calling for the \u201csaffron revolution\u201d. If so, I would retract my comments. If not, I hope these issues will be brought front and square into the debate.\u000a\u000aBy Vikram Mehta\u000a\u000aThe author is the chairman of Brookings India and senior fellow, Brookings Institution

VKOLKATA: The Indian Meteorological Department has finally woken up to the need for collecting more weather data from central Himalayas spanning Darjeeling, parts of Jalpaiguri and Sikkim Currently, the Himalayas is the most data-barren region in the world. This has hampered climatologists from studying the effects of global warming and making climate change predictions \u201cThe Arctic is the most data-rich region in the world. Hence, it has also been studied in detail. Scientists predict that at the rate of current glacial melt, the Arctic region will be ice-free by the turn of the century. But there is hardly any report on the Himalayan ice and glacial melt due to paucity of data,\u201d says Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change author Edvin Aldrin.Regional Meteorological Centre and Area Cyclone Warning Centre director G C Debnath said data shortage in the central Himalayas was due to absence of meteorological equipment in the region. \u201cFor most of the subcontinent, the Indian Met department has plenty of scientific data spanning over a century. This can be used to find out the future impact of climate change. Unfortunately, such data is not available for the Himalayan region. But we are trying to address the gap,\u201d he said.What prompted the office to look at the region more closely were phone calls from hoteliers in Kalimpong complaining that the cool climes had changed drastically and summers had become so hot that one could not do without fans. \u201cIn Kalimpong, most hotels did not have fans because it was never required. But now, it is extremely uncomfortable. We need to understand what is causing this change,\u201d the Met official said.To do so, the regional office has taken up an Integrated Himalayan Project to increase its network in the range. The proposed project pegged around Rs 300 crore includes installing 10 automatic rain gauges and eight snow gauges in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Sikkim. Once these are in place, the Met office will be able to collect high-altitude data on a regular basis.The project also includes two Doppler radars, one in Sikkim and the other in Jalpaiguri. These are crucial to predict when there will be heavy downpour and map the path of cyclones in advance. It can save lives in the Hills.

VNew Delhi: Aiming to increase India\u2019s forest cover, address climate change concerns and achieve a faster growth rate in the rural economy, the government has decided to merge the Green India Mission (GIM) with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).\u000a\u000aSince taking over in May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been emphasizing the need to optimize efficient use of resources and encouraging various ministries to work in tandem.\u000a\u000aThe guidelines for the convergence of MGNREGS with GIM were jointly issued by the secretary of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) Ashok Lavasa and secretary of the ministry of rural development (MoRD) Jugal Kishore Mohapatra earlier this month.\u000a\u000aA joint letter by Lavasa and Mohapatra, addressed to chief secretaries of all state governments, said the convergence aimed to synergize efforts made under MGNREGS for improving livelihoods through horticulture, plantation and farm forestry and collectively address climate change concerns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe trust that this integrated development approach with climate change adaptation and mitigation concerns will also benefit MGNREGS leading to better quality planning and selections of works capable of generating sustainable employment,\u201d the letter added.\u000a\u000aUnder the guidelines, the convergence of GIM with MGNREGS will also bring coordination in developing forests and their fringe areas as well as community or privately owned forests, while making vulnerable sections in rural India economically secure. The government believes it will also provide additional resources and benefits to the rural poor and generate sustainable employment.\u000a\u000aGIM, one of eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, aims to increase forest cover by five million hectares and bring qualitative improvements in forest and tree cover of another five million hectares to forest or non-forest land in 10 years. It also aims to increase the forest-based livelihood income of about three million households. MGNREGS, on the other hand, aims to provide guaranteed employment to the rural poor.\u000a\u000aUnder the terms of the convergence, all land, including village common land, community land, revenue wasteland, shifting cultivation areas, wetland and private agricultural land will be eligible for afforestation. The guidelines also clarified that for intensive afforestation, works like pre-plantation (in March-June), plantation (July), protection (August-March) and maintenance works like weeding, watering and manuring would be undertaken.\u000a\u000aThe move also involves strengthening of decentralized forest governance through a revamped state forest development agency (SFDA) at the state level, forest development agencies at in the districts and joint forest management committees at the village levels.\u000a\u000aThe secretaries said the SFDAs will build a cadre of \u2018green volunteers\u2019, a task involving training youth from MGNREGS households in forest conservation, basic forestry operations and improved livelihoods through horticulture, sericulture, farm forestry and promotion of livestock. The convergence guidelines also clearly laid out that required plant material would be delivered to gram panchayats before July every year by drawing on MGNREGS funds and that in case of fund shortages, GIM funds can be used.\u000a\u000aThe progress of plantation under the convergence would also be monitored periodically using remote sensing technology, ground monitoring by local communities and photographic evidence.

VNEW DELHI: The government has merged National Mission for a Green India, which aims afforestation at 10 million hectares of land over the next decade, with MGNREGA to increase and improve the country's forest cover.Modern technology like remote sensing will be used to monitor the progress of this initiative regularly.Currently, green works such as water harvesting, afforestation and farm foresty are undertaken under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme implemented by Rural Development Ministry.The government is also eyeing at increasing 10 million hectares of forest cover under the 'National Mission for a Green India' being implemented by the Environment Ministry."To further synergise these efforts and to collectively address the climate change concerns, the government has come out with convergence guidelines after consulting both Environment and Rural Development Ministries," a senior government official said.The convergence guidelines sets out the approach to be adopted to strengthen co-ordination at field-level for developing forest cover and improving forest-based livelihoods for about three million households.According to the guidelines issued by the Environment Ministry, all lands including village common lands, community lands, revenue wastelands, shifting cultivation areas, wetlands and private agricultural lands will be eligible for afforestation under this convergence.Under MGNREGA, forest works such as pre-plantation, pit digging, planting and watering, fencing, plant support and protection activities, weeding, mulching and manuring the plants among others can be undertaken for afforestation.State Forest Development Agencies (SFDA) will provide technical advice on plant species suitable for area, raise nurseries and deliver required plant material to each gram panchayat before July each year meeting the cost from MGNREGA funds."However, where there is a shortage of funds under MGNREGA, it may be topped up from Green India Mission funds," the guidelines said.

VNEW DELHI: India wants a global agreement that will address intensified efforts to tackle climate change between 2015 and 2020 and has questioned the single-minded focus on finalising a global compact for the post-2020 period, which is to be inked in Paris in December.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWith barely nine months left for the crucial climate change meeting in Paris, the pressure on countries to draw plans to reduce the amount of carbon produced after 2020 has increased. New Delhi has told the UN climate change body that there needs to be equal focus on the pre-2020 period, arguing that without active efforts to tackle climate change between 2015 and 2020, slowing down the rate of global warming will be different.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSources said that India has submitted a written request to the chairs of the negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to consider an agreement that will spell out the efforts to reduce the amount of carbon being produced and to adjust to the impacts of climate change. At the talks held in Geneva in February, Indian negotiators had raised the issue that countries, especially the industrialised nations, need to do much more to address rising emissions and the impact of unchecked climate change between 2015 and 2020.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have given it in writing to the chairmen of the ad-hoc working group on the Durban Platform. In 2011, when countries decided to craft a new agreement to address climate change, it was also decided to accelerate efforts to tackle global warming in the period up to 2020. But now the discussions are solely focused on the post-2020 agreement. The Durban Platform is both about the pre-2020 period and the post-2020 period,\u201d a senior member of the government said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Durban Platform agreed to in 2011 at the annual UN-sponsored climate change negotiations has two planks of action\u2014accelerating and intensifying efforts to address climate change in the pre-2020 period and finalising the new global agreement by 2015, which would be implemented after 2020.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the pre-2020 period, the onus of reducing the amount of carbon produced is on the industrialised countries, with developing countries taking steps on a voluntary basis. Industrialised countries are required to provide financial support, which was agreed in 2009 and 2010 to be to the tune of $100 billion a year, and were also committed to provide technology to developing countries to address climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s demand has the broad support of developing countries. At Geneva, where negotiators from 193 countries met for a week to finalise a draft of the post-2020 global compact, representatives of countries including China, South Africa and other African countries and small islands consistently stressed on the need to focus on increasing the efforts being made to tackle climate change before 2020.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDeveloping countries have argued that the lack of attention to the pre-2020 efforts only serve to transfer the burden of action to poor countries. The new agreement that comes into effect in 2020 is applicable to all countries, unlike the current regime, where the onus of action rests with the industrialised countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change maintain that delayed action will prove to be more expensive and many of the efforts that can be taken to slow global warming will be ineffective if not implemented as soon as possible.

VNew Delhi: India is in talks with more than half-a-dozen leading multilateral funding and lending agencies to try and raise at least $3 billion for solar power projects that will help meet its ambitious renewable energy target, cut the oil import bill and bolster the nation\u2019s position at climate change talks later this year.\u000a\u000aThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is in talks with lenders such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, Germany-based KfW Bankengruppe, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).\u000a\u000aIn addition, the government plans to tap the European Investment Bank (EIB) and France\u2019s Agence Franaise de Dveloppement (AFD) for raising loans for renewable energy projects.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are in discussion with ADB for two loans of $500 million each for solar parks and rooftops respectively. The proposal has gone to the bank. We also plan to raise $500 million each for solar parks and rooftops respectively from the World Bank for which the proposal is with the department of economic affairs (DEA),\u201d said a senior government official, requesting anonymity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe also have a plan to raise \u20ac1 billion for solar rooftop projects from KfW Bank. We are also talking to Jica and JBIC to raise funds,\u201d the official added.\u000a\u000aThe NDA government has pushed renewable energy to the top of its energy security agenda, seeking to reduce India\u2019s overwhelming dependence on coal-fuelled electricity. An earlier target of installing 20,000 megawatts (MW) of solar energy capacity by 2022 has been raised fivefold to 100,000MW.\u000a\u000aAnother government official, who too didn\u2019t want to be identified, confirmed that the government was in talks with various multilateral funding agencies such as the ones mentioned above.\u000a\u000aKfW is already involved in India\u2019s clean energy sector through its commitment of lending \u20ac1 billion for setting green energy transmission corridors. Jica has signed agreements with Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd and Small Industries Development Bank of India. Also, the US Trade and Development Agency has committed $2 billion for developing green energy projects in India. This commitment is in addition to a $1 billion medium- and long-term guaranteed loan from the Export-Import Bank of the US.\u000a\u000aWhile queries emailed to the spokespersons of India\u2019s ministries of finance and new and renewable energy remained unanswered, a World Bank spokesperson in an emailed response confirmed the development and said: \u201cThe ministry, DEA and the World Bank are working closely on this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJica first studies and surveys the project and make information public only after the MoU (memorandum of understanding) has been signed with the government of India,\u201d said an external spokesperson for the Japanese government agency in India.\u000a\u000aForeign loans are cheaper than those offered by local banks and financial institutions. However, even though the interest costs of foreign loans are lower, project developers have to hedge their foreign currency exposure.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of people are ready to borrow,\u201d said the first government official cited above.\u000a\u000a\u201cEIB is engaged in discussions with the government of India to find suitable projects that are eligible for EIB financing,\u201d said an EIB spokesperson in an emailed response.\u000a\u000aThe government is expecting an investment of $200 billion in green energy projects from companies. The new government has secured pledges from 213 companies to set up renewable energy capacity of 266 gigawatts (GW) over the next five years. While domestic financial institutions have made a commitment to finance renewable energy projects totalling 78GW, firms have been demanding cheaper loans to set up these projects.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are examining financial models to give a thrust to renewable energy,\u201d said Piyush Goyal, minister for power, coal, and new and renewable energy, at an energy conclave on Friday in New Delhi, while adding that renewables form an important part for India\u2019s energy security priorities.\u000a\u000aGreen energy has a share of only 12.14%, or 31,692.14MW, in the country\u2019s installed power generation capacity of 261,006.46 MW.\u000a\u000aIn response to a query about the Indian government being in talks with ADB for two loans of $500 million each for solar parks and solar rooftop projects respectively, a ADB spokesperson in an emailed response said: \u201cADB has recently approved Clean Energy Finance Investment Program,\u201d and added, \u201cRegarding the support to solar parks, ADB\u2019s support (we are talking of sovereign loans here) is indirect\u2014through upgrading the transmission infrastructure for evacuating power produced in the solar parks, for example, ADB has provided a loan to the government of Rajasthan.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NDA government wants to ensure 24-hour power supply to all households in a chronically power-deficit country. Around 300 million Indians lack access to electricity and per capita electricity consumption in India is one-fourth of the world\u2019s average.\u000a\u000aQueries emailed to the spokespersons of KfW Bankengruppe and AFD remained unanswered at the time of going to press. Queries posted on the JBIC website also remained unanswered.\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s focus on renewable energy stems from a desire to cut India\u2019s energy import bill of around $150 billion, which is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports 77% of its energy requirements. In addition, the emphasis on solar and wind power is expected to strengthen the country\u2019s standing at global climate change negotiations that culminate in a summit in Paris in December.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s energy-related moves are being watched keenly in the lead-up to the climate change summit. The nation\u2019s massive dependence on coal-fuelled energy makes it the third largest emitter of harmful greenhouse gases after the US and China, but it is yet to agree to binding emission cuts, arguing rich nations must bear the primary responsibility for causing climate change.

VCutting global beef consumption and eating protein-rich poultry and eggs instead could lead to major climate benefits, says a new research.\u000a\u000aThe study by David Bryngelsson from Chalmers University of Technology in investigated various future scenarios to determine how the climate would be impacted if humans were to change their diet.\u000a\u000aThe research shows that adopting a diet in which the protein derives from poultry is a smart and inexpensive way to reduce our impact on the climate.\u000a\u000a"Cattle ranching is already responsible for 15 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions that humans cause. The diet we are accustomed to in wealthy countries is not consistent with our climate goals," says Bryngelsson, who recently presented his doctoral thesis on land use, food related greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change.\u000a\u000aEven though vegan diet in less greenhouse gases, Bryngelsson's research shows that we can continue eating animal protein and still make a major contribution to the climate - if we replace beef with poultry and eggs, and cut down on our consumption of milk and cheese.\u000a\u000a"Even people who eat an extremely protein-rich LCHF diet with chicken as the base make a greater contribution to the environment than vegetarians who consume a great deal of dairy products".\u000a\u000aThere might be ethical objections to the current chicken industry, but Bryngelsson believes that climate gains will prevail even with more animal-friendly production methods.\u000a\u000aTechnical improvements in the production chain can to a certain extent also reduce the food industry's climate impact, but cattle are still the biggest problem as they need a lot of feed and they release methane as they ruminate.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, forests are being devastated to make room for the increasing number of cattle.\u000a\u000aThe study also shows the difference between chicken and beef as regards to area requirements and greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aThis is because a hen can have around 150 chicks per year as compared to a cow that can give birth to not quite one calf per year, and because chicks grow extremely quickly and thus absorb a significantly greater proportion of their feed.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, cows belch large amounts of methane while chewing on their cud, which is something chickens do not do.

Vrequirement in the country will increase up to 6.8 times in the next 50 years, said Former Chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board,\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSpeaking on 'Estimating India's Future Needs of Electricity' recently at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), Sukhatme said, "In order to improve the standard of living in India, in the next 50 years, it will be necessary to increase the value of the mean annual per capita consumption of from the present value of 800 to 900 kWh to around 4000 kWh. This need will correspond to an annual requirement of about 6800 tWh of electrical energy."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEmphasizing on the need for frugal use of electricity, Sukhatme said that days of plentiful and cheap energy are over. "When the population of the country stabilized at 1700 million after 50 years, the energy demand will increase by 6.8 times of what we produce today. Even if the population used energy frugally the demand will increase by 3.12 times. Installation of every megawatts of costs between Rs 5-15 crore," he said.\u000a\u000aCurrently, India has installed capacity of producing around 250,000 Mw of electricity. Talking about high cost of harvesting renewable energy, Sukhatme said that fluctuation and intermittency in energy output from the renewable sources is the main challenge.\u000a\u000a"Renewable sources of energy will become a significant contributor to energy needs and it will be then the issue of intermittency will be strongly felt. These are issues which no country has sorted out," Sukhatme said while pointing out that electricity and fresh water will be two big issues in the country in the future. "These two 'key words' will determine the future of the country," he added.

VA day after agreed to supply uranium to India, Prime Minister Modi today said must succeed in harnessing clean energy like nuclear power to combat climate change and address global concerns.\u000a\u000aHe regretted that was denied reactors by the world despite the land of and Gautam having an impeccable record in peace.\u000a\u000a"The whole world is worried about global warming and climate change. People in air-conditioned rooms discuss this issue. But if succeeds in generating clean energy, one-sixth of the humanity will take responsibility for addressing the climate change. For that nuclear energy is important," he said addressing the Indian diaspora here at a function where Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife were present.\u000a\u000aModi said the biggest decision during his ongoing three-nation trip was with regard to the civil nuclear field in France where it was decided that reactors will be built in India.\u000a\u000a"But the reactors will need uranium which will be given by Canada," he said referring to the agreement signed yesterday under which will supply 3,000 metric tonnes of uranium over next five years at a cost of USD 254 million.\u000a\u000aHe said earlier India used to ask countries for reactors but they would throw up their hands. "They used to fear that India may build a bomb. Those who make the bombs are not stopped by anybody," he said, without naming anyone.\u000a\u000aModi thanked Harper for the immense enthusiasm with which he was received here and said the relationship between the two countries will be "very long and fruitful".\u000a\u000aAt the same time, he took a dig at former governments in India. "In this age of aeroplanes, it takes about 15-20 hours to reach but it took an Indian Prime Minister 42 years to come here," he said, adding that "I did it in 10 months".\u000a\u000aCiting his "very good" experience of working with Canada since the time he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi said "working together of India and Canada can make them a strong force."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTalking about his ambition of ensuring India's development, he said its requirements can be met by Canada.\u000a\u000aPraising Canada, Modi said it had partnered Gujarat in its annual Vibrant Gujarat fair since 2003 when he was the Chief Minister there.\u000a\u000a"For a developed country to be a partner country of a state is not a small decision...I will return home tomorrow but I can never forget Canada's love," he said.\u000a\u000aHarper described Modi's visit as "historic" and said his country wants to work with India in enhancing trade, investments and working in the security area.

VNew Delhi: India, in a surprising about-face, proposed to amend a protocol to accelerate the phase-out of some of the planet\u2019s most potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, automobiles and air conditioners.\u000a\u000aThe submission to revise the 1989 Montreal Protocol was filed ahead of negotiations in Bangkok starting 22 April, according to documents posted by conference organizers on the United Nations Environment Programme website. In the past, India has been among the biggest opponents to halting the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).\u000a\u000aThe proposal is a \u201cstunning evolution\u201d in India\u2019s position since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office last year, said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development.\u000a\u000a\u201cModi is emerging as a leading climate voice on the global stage, and the India HFC proposal is concrete evidence of both his conviction and his sophistication,\u201d Zaelke said in an email.\u000a\u000aWhile HFCs are as much as 11,700 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, efforts to address them have been stalled by log-jammed United Nations climate-treaty talks. India joins the US, Canada and others in pushing for a faster phase-out by bringing the gases under the Montreal deal, originally designed to protect the ozone layer rather than the climate.\u000a\u000aIndia had previously blocked proposed amendments to the protocol saying it was the wrong treaty to bring about changes. A quicker phase-out would give developing nations including India less time to find economic alternatives, vital for air conditioners in hot climates. Also, India is home to major HFC producers, including SRF Ltd, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd, Navin Fluorine International Ltd and Chemplast Sanmar Ltd, which in the past have earned at least $800 million worth of carbon credits for limiting emissions of the gases. Indications of a change in India\u2019s stand surfaced in January after the summit between Modi and US President Barack Obama in New Delhi. According to a joint statement issued after the meeting, the two \u201creaffirmed their prior understanding from September 2014 concerning the phase down of HFCs and agreed to cooperate on making concrete progress in the Montreal Protocol this year\u201d.\u000a\u000aModi has sought to shed India\u2019s image as a climate obstructionist, telling his top advisers in January that the nation needs a more constructive image.\u000a\u000aIn its proposal, India called for the \u201cexpertise and institutions of the Montreal Protocol\u201d to be used to phase out production and consumption of HFCs. However, it said the gases should still be accounted for and reported as a part of any UN climate treaty.\u000a\u000aA UN report in October said the transition away from HFCs may cost developing nations between $500 million and $3.2 billion, depending on how quickly new cooling technology is adopted. To win support globally, the US and other developed nations are promising $508 million in aid over three years to help poorer countries make the switch.\u000a\u000aMint\u2019s Mayank Aggarwal contributed to this story.

VNEW DELHI: Reversing its several years of opposition, India has, in a major decision relating to a global treaty, made a formal proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the climate-damaging refrigerant HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) which are used in air-conditioners, refrigerators and insulating foams.India has, however, through this amendment sought a transition period of 15 years for phasing out HFCs so that its domestic industries get enough time to switch over to cleaner technically feasible and economically viable alternatives.India submitted its formal amendment to the Montreal Protocol office in Nairobi on Thursday evening, ahead of its working group meeting which is to take place in Bangkok during April 22-24.The country's amendment proposal is in tune with what the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to the American president Barack Obama during his visit to the US in September last year.India, which had earlier completely opposed to an idea of phasing down the HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, has now in its submission proposed the amendment, saying the country wants to phase-down production and consumption of the HFCs using "expertise and institutions of the Montreal Protocol and continue to include HFCs within the scope of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol for accounting and reporting of emissions"."Prime Minister Modi is emerging as a leading climate voice on the global stage, and the India HFC proposal is concrete evidence of both his conviction and his sophistication", said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Washington-based Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development (IGSD).Keeping its domestic business interest in mind, India, at the same time, insisted that the phase down of the HFCs will depend on "flexibilities in terms of choice of alternative technologies and timeframe for transitioning to safe, technically proven, energy-efficient and economically & commercially viable technologies".The developed nations have long been demanding that the HFC to be brought under the purview of the Montreal Protocol which currently deals only with Ozone-depleting substances. Since the HFC is not an Ozone depleting substance, it is currently listed as one of the greenhouse gases under the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol which is only binding on rich industrialised countries.The Montreal Protocol, on the other hand, is applied to all countries including India which signed it in 1992. Once the amendment is accepted through negotiation, developing countries including India will also phase down the HFCs in a time-bound manner."India filed its formal proposal with the Montreal Protocol secretariat as required by the rules of the treaty. It's a reflection of how India sees its interest..It also asks for more funding and more flexibility with phase down schedules", said Zaelke.He told TOI, "Like the other proposal(s), all of the elements will have to be negotiated and agreed upon by the Parties (member countries)".Under the UPA rule, India had been the most vocal opponent to phasing down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, a strategy first proposed in 2009 by the Federated States of Micronesia, and quickly followed by a proposal by the US, Mexico, and Canada."With India emerging as the leader of the HFC phase down, we are moving into position to finish the amendment at the November Meeting of the Parties, and provide a boost to the UN climate negotiations in Paris the following month", said Zaelke.The Africa group of 54 countries had endorsed the HFC amendment last month, and Senegal has requested on their behalf that formal negotiations start on the amendments.

VAccumulation of regulatory assets (unrealised tariff) has been problem for private distribution companies. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aDevelopers of new coal-based power plants will have to set up renewable power units amounting to 10% of the total capacity, as the government integrated its commitment to reduce the emission intensity of the gross domestic product in a new tariff policy announced earlier this week.\u000a\u000aWhile the new thermal power units, for whom the new norm will be mandatory, will have their tariffs decided factoring in the (usually high) cost of renewable energy, developers of existing coal-based units will be allowed to transmit the additional cost to the consumers if they add generation facilities based on benign, non-conventional sources like solar energy and wind.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, to the extent of the renewable capacity, the developers will be given relief from inter-state transmission charges for a specified period.\u000a\u000aWhile these measures are in sync with the Modi government\u2019s ambitious plan to augment the country\u2019s renewable energy capacity to a whopping 160 giga watts (GW) by 2022, the changes to the national tariff policy 2006 unveiled by the power ministry also stipulated that distribution companies should be allowed to recover outstanding regulatory asset along with interest within a period not exceeding seven years. The state regulatory commission may specify the trajectory for the recovery, as per the policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe emphasis on renewable energy is forward-looking and commendable but the success of the policy would entirely depend on the financial status of the state electricity board buying such power. Considering that the power available in the spot market is currently below R3/unit, unless the renewable\u000a\u000apower cost comes down to R4.5 per unit, the states would find it difficult to procure and pass it on to the consumers,\u201d Debasish Mishra, senior director, Deloitte told FE.\u000a\u000aAccording to the policy, \u201cthe renewable energy produced by each generator may be bundled with its thermal generation for the purpose of tariff determination. In case a distribution company procures this renewable power, then this would be considered by the SERCs to meet the Renewable Purchase Obligation of the distribution company.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe cost of renewable power generation will determine the success of the policy. At current levels the government will have to subsidise renewable energy for the buyers to buy it,\u201d an executive working at a power generation company said. He added the state-run power developer NTPC was finding it difficult to execute a similar plan that involves bundling solar power with unallocated thermal power as the company has found it difficult to locate buyers for such power.\u000a\u000aAs regards the transmission sector, the amendments fail to specify a deadline for exemption of inter-state transmission projects (that practically goes to the Power Grid Corporation of India) from the tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) route. Although the 2006 policy had set a cut-off date (2013) for awarding projects on nomination basis, the government has continued to award such projects to PGCIL, undermining competition.\u000a\u000aWhile the previous tariff policy had three criteria for not adopting TBCB route, the government has now expanded it to eight instances where bidding could be avoided. \u201cIt\u2019s a backward step for transmission sector and in turn for the entire power sector. The criteria for awarding projects on cost-plus basis to PGCIL has stymied the growth of the power sector and robbed the consumers of the benefit that could flow from enhanced efficiency that the private players could bring,\u201d a power transmission company executive told FE.\u000a\u000aAccumulation of regulatory assets (unrealised tariff) has been problem for private distribution companies. For instance, the three discoms in Delhi have piled up a combined regulatory asset of over Rs 20,000 crore. This has led to discoms demanding a steep tariff hike only to face stiff resistance from the state government.\u000a\u000a10 MW solar for every 100 MW thermal\u000a\u000aDevelopers of these coal-based units will be allowed pass-through of the extra cost as bundled power.\u000a\u000aExisting coal-fired stations will be allowed to transmit the additional cost if they set up renewable energy units.\u000a\u000aRegulatory assets will have to be recovered in a maximum of seven years.\u000a\u000aNew policy relapses on competitive bidding for transmission projects; no deadline for ending award of inter-state transmission projects on nomination basis.\u000a\u000aFor Updates Check Economy News; follow us on Facebook and Twitter

VSolving a 4,000-year-old mystery, scientists have found that climate change may be responsible for the abrupt collapse of civilisation on the fringes of the Tibetan Plateau around 2000 BC.\u000a\u000aWashington State University archaeologist Jade D'Alpoim Guedes and an international team of researchers found that cooling global temperatures at the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a 4,000 year period of warm weather, would have made it impossible for ancient people on the Tibetan Plateau to cultivate millet, their primary food source.\u000a\u000aGuedes' team's research provides the first convincing explanation for why the area's original inhabitants either left or so abruptly changed their lifestyles.\u000a\u000aThe findings also explain the success of farmers who practiced wheat and barley agriculture in the region 300 years later.\u000a\u000aUnlike millet, wheat and barley have high frost tolerance and a low heat requirement, making them ideally suited for the high altitudes and cold weather of eastern Tibet, Guedes said.\u000a\u000aShe said this made the two crops an important facet of subsistence immediately after their introduction around 1700 BC.\u000a\u000a"Wheat and barley came in at the opportune moment, right when millets were losing their ability to be grown on the Tibetan Plateau," Guedes said.\u000a\u000a"It was a really exciting pattern to notice. The introduction of wheat and barley really enabled Tibetan culture to take the form it has today, and their unique growth patterns may have played a crucial rule in the spread of these crops as staples across the vast region of East Asia," she said.\u000a\u000aResearchers also said that the ancient millet seeds that fell out of cultivation on the Tibetan Plateau as the climate got colder might soon be useful again as the climate warms up.\u000a\u000aAt Ashaonao, Haimenkou, and other archeological sites in the Tibetan highlands, researchers for years had noticed a growing trend. An abundance of ancient wheat and barley seeds found at the sites suggested the crops rapidly replaced millet as the staple food source of the region during the second millennium BC.\u000a\u000aThe findings were puzzling considering that the scientific consensus of the time was the region's climate would have actually favoured millet, due to its shorter growing season, over wheat or barley.\u000a\u000aGuedes dove into the agronomy literature to investigate. She found agronomists tended to use a different measurement than archaeologists to determine whether crops can grow in cold, high altitude environments like the Tibetan Plateau.\u000a\u000aThey used total growing degree days or the accumulated amount of heat plants need over their lifetime rather than the length of a growing season.\u000a\u000a"My colleagues and I created a new model based off what we found in the literature," Guedes said.\u000a\u000a"It revealed that global cooling would have made it impossible to grow millet in the Eastern Tibetan Highlands at this time but would have been amenable to growing wheat and barley," she said.

So, the focus of the new government is finding ways to encourage bio-fuels and have alternate energy sources to fossil fuels,\u201d a senior government functionary said.\u000a\u000aNiti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya said that the new policy will be framed in consultation with the ministries of power, coal and could be expected in the next few months.\u000a\u000aThe man behind the UPA\u2019s energy policy, Kirit Parikh, agreed to some extent with the new government that a lot has changed in the energy sector and said there was nothing wrong on modifying his policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe concern for environment is much more than it was in 2006 and there was not much talk about the Shale gas. But, I hope that government studies the positive impact of the existing policy while framing the new one,\u201d Parikh told HT.\u000a\u000aThe new policy will address the issue of regulatory framework for decentralised power that could be provided to 330 million Indian homes that are not connected to electricity grid as of now.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe burning issue of 80% of rural homes using polluting biomass for cooking will also be discussed,\u201d the functionary said.

VKFW, the German lending agency, and the Centre have agreed to fund the green energy corridor planned by Andhra Pradesh with the objective of transforming the State into a renewable energy hub.\u000a\u000aAccording to the State Energy Conservation Mission, KFW is likely to sanction Rs 500 crore and the Central Power Ministry Rs 515 crore to develop the Rs 3,500 crore green energy corridor.\u000a\u000aAccording to Ajay Jain, Secretary, Energy, Industries and Infrastructure, efforts are now under way to develop a green corridor to support the upcoming solar and wind projects with an initial cost of about Rs 1289 crore. Efforts are under way to secure necessary funding with the support of the Centre and International Financial institutions.\u000a\u000aState Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has thanked the Centre for sanctioning Rs 515 crore grant for setting up the green energy corridor. The AP Transco and Discoms would initiate steps soon to mobilise the balance investments from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).\u000a\u000aHaving set a target of 5000 MW of solar photovoltaic and 4000 MW in the wind energy sector by 2019, the State is planning to constitute a taskforce for expediting the renewable energy projects.\u000a\u000aAjay Jain further said the State is on course to developing world\u2019s biggest solar park with a capacity of 2,500 MW with the support of the Centre, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), NVVL, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000aThe State plans to extend all facilities and fiscal incentives provided by Central Government/National Solar Mission to the manufacturers in solar parks. It is proposed to set up Special Purpose Vehicles for development of infrastructure and management of solar park.\u000a\u000aK Vijayanand, Chairman and Managing Director of AP Transco, said the State has secured environmental clearance for Krishnapatnam and Vijayawada Thermal Power Stations (VTPS). This paves the way for the State to enhancing the generating capacity.

VThere are some good and bad news for climate change enthusiasts. Researchers have found that along with the rise in carbon emissions, the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has also gone up. But there is no guarantee that it would continue.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAbout half of the emissions of CO2 each year remain in the atmosphere; the other half is taken up by the ecosystems on land and the oceans, and the rates of CO2 absorption by Earth have so far increased in proportion to emissions, the study noted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Since the emissions today are three times higher than they were in the 1960s, this increased uptake by land and ocean is not only surprising; it is good news," said study co-author Richard Houghton, senior scientist at Woods Hole Research Center at Massachusetts in the US.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Without it, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would be twice what it is, and climate change would be much farther along. But, there is no guarantee that it will continue," Houghton cautioned.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 1956, when the monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentrations began at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) on the island of Hawaii, many more stations have been added to measure the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and how it varies seasonally and geographically.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"There is no question that land and oceans have, for at least the last five and half decades, been taking up about half of the carbon emitted each year," Houghton said.\u000a\u000a"Most of the processes responsible for that uptake would be expected to slow down as the Earth warms, but we have not seen it yet," Houghton noted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe researchers conclude that the greater certainty in atmospheric carbon measurements has led to an increased certainty in the calculated rate of carbon uptake by land and oceans. Monitoring that uptake year by year is critical for understanding the carbon cycle and for knowing how to deal with it.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Biogeosciences.\u000a\u000a

VCan Delhiites be paid for consuming power? May be, that is if the national capital is able to implement solar rooftops in homes as Germany has in the past 20 years and can move from being a power deficient to a power surplus state.\u000a\u000aGermany was one of the first countries to allow grid-connected solar rooftops by the way of feed in tariff, which meant that people got more money for the green power they generated than the power they consumed. Feed in tariff is the money from solar power generator gets credited into a resident\u2019s electricity bill by the power distributor (discom) for each unit of electricity generated.\u000a\u000aFeed in tariff is valued at slightly higher than the average price the consumer pays for per unit power consumed.\u000a\u000aAccording to the policy, the house owners have been assured higher rates for 20 years and such a policy has resulted in Germany now having over a million homes generating power, which accounts for over 80% of solar power generated in the country. Such a boost has enabled Germany to decide a roadmap to shun nuclear power in the next 20 years and reduce dependence on coal.\u000a\u000aThe push for solar rooftops has caused the green tariff to nosedive and now it is less than any other energy source in one of the most developed nations of the world.\u000a\u000aThe reason for this does not lie in Germany but in far-off China and India that up-scaled its solar energy targets triggering massive demand and pushing the prices down. A clear impact was visible in many European countries like Germany. \u201cIn 2014, we literally gave money to people to consume power for about 10 hours,\u201d said Christian Redl of Agora Energiewende, a Berlin based energy think tank. \u201cThe way we are generating RE power and becoming energy efficient the possibility of people getting money for consuming powers will be higher.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe lesson for Delhi from the German experience is that though the initial cost of solar energy system is high because of installation charges, it gets cheaper than any other source of power in the longer run.\u000a\u000a\u201cCost of your nuclear, coal or lignite power will increase but cost of solar power only becomes less. That is the advantage of investing in renewables although it still has some technological issues that need to be looked into,\u201d said R Andreas Kreamer, founder of Ecologic Institute, a 20-year-old think on ecological issues.\u000a\u000aBut, to make Delhi a power surplus state that produces cheaper power, the government will have to make financing solar powered homes possible as Germany did. German banks provide long term (15 to 20 year) loans to install a solar roof top that covers over 90% of the cost.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has provided a business model for homes and has worked wonders here,\u201d said Carel Mohn of Clean Energy Wire. None of the Indian banks have yet come up with a scheme to finance solar rooftops.\u000a\u000aDelhi has a potential to generate over 30,000MW of power annually \u2014 five times its present demand \u2014 if just one-third of its homes install some solar photo voltaic, an assessment by the ministry of new and renewable energy says.Experts, also, warn that Delhi should not repeat the mistakes that Germany committed; higher tariff for solar power for a long period and very less market intervention that did not allow solar power to be traded separately. \u201cThe net metering rates should be revised on annual basis and should be applicable to earlier contracts also,\u201d Kreamer said.But, there is consensus that net metering concept can revolutionise solar penetration in sun rich nations like India.

VThe global climate is on the verge of broad-scale change that could last for a number of decades, shows a study by British scientists.\u000a\u000aThe change is linked to cooling of the Atlantic, and is likely to bring drier summers in Britain and Ireland.\u000a\u000aThe study is based on observational evidence of the link between ocean circulation and the decadal variability of sea surface temperatures called the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO).\u000a\u000a"Sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic vary between warm and cold over time-scales of many decades.\u000a\u000a"These variations have been shown to influence temperature, rainfall, drought and even the frequency of hurricanes in many regions of the world," said lead author Gerard McCarthy from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC).\u000a\u000aThese climatic phases are the result of the movement of heat northwards by a system of ocean currents.\u000a\u000aThis movement of heat changes the temperature of the sea surface, which has a profound impact on climate on timescales of 20-30 years.\u000a\u000aThe strength of ocean currents has been measured by a network of sensors, called the RAPID array, which have been collecting data on the flow rate of the Atlantic meridonal overturning circulation (AMOC) for a decade.\u000a\u000aThe authors used 100 years of sea level data, maintained by the National Oceanography Centre's permanent service for mean sea level.\u000a\u000a"By reconstructing ocean circulation over the last 100 years from tide gauges that measure sea level at the coast, we have been able to show, for the first time, observational evidence of the link between ocean circulation and the AMO," said co-author Ivan Haigh, lecturer in coastal oceanography at the University of Southampton.\u000a\u000aThe study appeared in the journal Nature.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aKarnataka, which entered the global power map by setting up Asia\u2019s first hydroelectric station, is now embarking on another milestone mission of setting up a mega solar power park, said to be the world\u2019s biggest. The park, with a capacity of 2,000 MW, will come up on 10,000 acres of land in the parched Pavagada taluk of Tumakuru district.\u000a\u000aSecretary, Union Ministry of New and Renewal Energy, Upendra Tripathy and Additional Chief Secretary, Karnataka Energy Department, Ravi Kumar, who announced this at a press conference here on Friday, said the work on the proposed park would start soon.\u000a\u000aThe 1,000 MW solar park being implemented in Andhra Pradesh is the biggest such project so far in the country. The Centre would support the park by offering a subsidy of Rs. 20 lakh per mega Watt, Mr. Tripathy said.\u000a\u000aAccording to sources, Pavagada was chosen for the solar park because of a combination of various factors, including high sunlight exposure, backwardness of the area, and lesser demand for land.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the park, Karnataka has bigger plans for the renewable energy sector as the State on Friday committed itself to setting up projects to tap green energy to the tune of 16,000 MW in the next five to seven years. The commitment was made at a meeting with Ministry of New and Renewal Energy authorities here where the Centre wanted the States to take up the responsibility of executing green energy project proposals to the tune of 1,75,000 MW received by it during the renewable energy global investors\u2019 meet.\u000a\u000aTo facilitate evacuation of such a massive quantum of renewable energy from the generation sites, the Centre has also decided to set up an exclusive pan-India green corridor at a cost of Rs. 36,000 crore, Mr. Tripathy said. To raise resources for renewable energy sector infrastructure, the Centre would float tax-free green bonds to the tune of Rs. 5,000 crore in about three months from now, he said.\u000a\u000aSet up roof-top solar plants with home loans\u000a\u000aSpecial Correspondent\u000a\u000aNow, you can set up a roof-top solar power plant on your house to take care of your power requirements through bank loans which would be part of home loan or home improvement loan.\u000a\u000aSecretary, Union Ministry for New and Renewable Energy, Upendra Tripathi, who announced this at a press conference here on Friday, said this was possible as the Reserve Bank of India had included renewable energy under the priority lending category. Individuals could borrow a maximum of Rs. 10 lakh under this scheme.\u000a\u000aAlso to take care of the service and repair requirements of such roof-top solar power plants, the Centre was set to launch Surya Mithra scheme under which 50,000 rural unemployed youth with a qualification of Class 7 would be given free training in handling solar power plants, he said.

V(Third of a three-part series assessing India\u2019s energy options as climate-change gathers pace: Read the earlier articles: Part I: Indians are marginal polluters, so why cut back on coal consumption? | Part II: Why India must submit to King Coal - for now)\u000a\u000aThe first and second part of this series largely argued that India\u2013the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases but 127th in per capita emissions\u2013had few short-term economic options to using as its main energy source.\u000a\u000aWhat is not frequently considered in India are the health and environmental impacts of using coal, which generates 75% of the country\u2019s electricity. Let\u2019s consider some impacts:\u000a\u000aAbout 115,000 people die prematurely from caused by Indian coal-fired plants, including 10,000 children below age five.\u000a\u000aThe health costs to India are about $4.6 billion (Rs 29,400 crore) annually, which is the cost of setting up five power plants of 1,000 mega watts (MW) each, or 2% of India\u2019s installed capacity, every year.\u000a\u000aThe death toll and health costs were estimated in a 2013 study by a former World Bank analyst.\u000a\u000afrom an Indian power plant were estimated to kill 650 people, said this study of between 2000 and 2008, conducted by Harvard University researchers.\u000a\u000a\u201cAir produced by coal-fired power plants has been linked to premature from lung cancer, respiratory illness and heart disease,\u201d said another 2012 study on the health effects of coal generation in India.\u000a\u000aAlthough from coal-fired plants are expected to double by 2030, according to this projection by Urban Emissions, a non-profit, there are no emissions standards fixed for sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), two of the three main pollutants from such plants.\u000a\u000aThese studies make it evident that not only do coal-fired power plants come at a cost, which is likely to skyrocket, but a detailed national accounting of the health and environmental impacts is not available.\u000a\u000aTiming is right for Modi\u2019s great solar-wind push\u000a\u000aZero green-house emissions. Zero fuel costs.\u000a\u000aThe advantages of solar and wind energy are well known (hydro-power shares similar characteristics, but as we previously discussed, they face significant hurdles.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s power sector added 22,566 MW (225 gigawatts, or GW) of conventional capacity\u201392% from coal-fired plants\u2013during financial year 2014-15 and 18,846 MW (188 GW) during 2013-14. Bearing in mind capacity additions in thermal, nuclear and over the next seven years, is likely to account for between 10% and 15% of India\u2019s total energy need.\u000a\u000aWith up to 400 million Indians without reliable energy, and industrial demand growing, the need for coal-fired electricity is estimated to increase three times by 2030, with consequent environmental impacts.\u000a\u000aIn talking about what he calls the \u201cseven horses of energy\u201c\u2013coal, nuclear, hydro, gas, solar, wind and biogas\u2013Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared that India\u2019s efforts should increasingly move towards the latter three.\u000a\u000aThis support for is in line with steps around the world to shift out of fossil fuels. This transition would get a boost from far-off Norway as legislators there consider changing the way their wealth fund works. The sovereign wealth fund\u2014the world\u2019s largest at Rs 57.6 lakh crore ($900 billion)\u2014could start divesting its stake in companies that earn more than 30% of their revenues from This move would send a strong message to corporations\u2013and countries\u2013everywhere about the need for change.\u000a\u000aIn his latest budget speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley referred to a renewable-energy capacity target of 175,000 MW by 2022, against a current base of 33,750 MW (refer table 1). This would be primarily solar (100,000 MW) and wind (60,000 MW), the two big hopes for a clean, carbon-free future.\u000a\u000aTable 1: Renewable power capacity in India (Dec 2014) Source Installed Capacity (MW) Share (%) Capital Cost\u000a\u000a(Rs crore/MW) Cost of Electricity (Rs/unit) Wind 22,500 67.0 5.5-6 3.5-4 Small hydropower 3,990 11.9 7.5-8 3-3.75 Biomass 4,200 12.6 4.5-5 3.5-4 Solar 3,060 9.06 8-12 7-11\u000a\u000aSource: MNRE, Lok Sabha\u000a\u000aOver the last 10 years, from 2005-06 to 2014-15, the renewable-energy installed capacity rose five times to reach 12% (according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy; the Press Information Bureau says it is 8%) of India\u2019s installed power capacity, or 33 GW, as on December 2014.\u000a\u000aSmall and are good for local needs, but they are not an answer to large-scale energy demands.\u000a\u000aCurrently, wind accounts for 67% of renewable-energy generation capacity in India, contributing 22 GW, followed by (4 MW), small hydro (4 MW) and solar (3 MW).\u000a\u000aThis sounds promising, but it really isn\u2019t.\u000a\u000aThe answer is not blowing in the wind\u000a\u000aWind energy is well-established in India with a capacity of 22,500 MW (and a potential of 102,788 MW, or 102.7 GW), 40% of India\u2019s current power-generation capacity. India ranks fifth in the world in wind-energy capacity, as these data indicate:\u000a\u000aBut wind energy needs, well, windy areas, and the wind, obviously, does not blow all the time. As a result, a typical wind mill generates less than one-fourth the electricity of a coal-based power plant of same capacity (see box \u201cAn explanation of energy efficiency\u201d at the bottom.)\u000a\u000aAlmost 90% of India\u2019s installed wind-mills are in just five states: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan, all states that have mandated that a share of energy (between 5% and 10%) from utilities must come from\u000a\u000aEven if India were to generate its full potential of wind energy, that would only be equivalent to a year\u2019s addition of conventional electricity, which was 22,566 MW (225 GW) in 2014-15.\u000a\u000aWind energy is clean and quiet, but it cannot replace The renewable-energy holy grail is solar power.\u000a\u000aThe sun shines bright over India, but the outlook is still cloudy\u000a\u000aThe real potential in a sunny country to replace fossil fuels is solar: India has a renewable-energy potential of about 895 GW, of which 750 GW is solar, as IndiaSpend previously reported.\u000a\u000aBy 2022, could achieve grid-parity in India, meaning it would cost the same as other sources of electricity. That is the year, as another IndiaSpend report said, renewable-energy sector, primarily solar, could generate 1 million jobs.\u000a\u000aSolar power plants can be built faster than either coal, nuclear or plants. Solar power installations rose 10-fold globally between 2008 to 2014, largely because of falling costs and improving solar-cell technology.\u000a\u000aSeveral Indian state governments have identified sites to set up large-scale solar-power plants: 17 solar parks in 12 states, with a capacity of 17,500 MW are proposed. Apart from zero emissions, job creation is another benefit.\u000a\u000aMost of this will be from small-scale, rooftop solar power plants, not grid-scale mega projects. Several public and private sector firms, including NTPC, Adani, Welspun Energy and Azure Power have already announced plans for large-scale solar-power plants, while some large-scale projects have also been completed.\u000a\u000aSolar power faces four major challenges; three related to economics and logistics can be addressed, while the last appears to be beyond current technology frontiers.\u000a\u000a1. High (but falling) costs: Solar electricity in India currently costs between Rs 7 to Rs 11 per unit (refer table 1), compared to a cost of between Rs 2.7 to Rs 3.3 per unit for nuclear, coal and hydropower. At these costs, is not commercially viable. But technology is improving and costs are dropping.\u000a\u000aFor instance, NTPC, India\u2019s largest electricity company, recently signed an agreement to build a 1,000 MW solar-power plant in Andhra Pradesh. The 250-MW first phase will supply electricity at Rs 6.16 per unit, which is high, but it will stay the same for 25 years, while the cost of coal-based power will rise as the mining and coal prices increase.\u000a\u000a2. Lots of land needed in land-starved India: Solar power needs a large area to tap relatively modest amounts of energy. For instance, the 1,000-MW NTPC project mentioned earlier will be spread over 5,400 acres of land, or 5.4 acres per MW. Since 4 MW of solar power replaces 1 MW of coal or (an explanation later), this means 20-25 acres of land will be needed to replace 1 MW of conventional energy.\u000a\u000aIndia added 22,000 MW of generation capacity during 2014-15; replacing that with will mean 475,200 acres of land\u2013a hot-button issue\u2013on which no plants can grow.\u000a\u000aThere are two ways of getting around the land block. First, rooftop-solar power (mandatory for new buildings in France), which is becoming increasingly popular in cities such as Pune and Bangalore. Tata Solar estimates that the potential of rooftop solar power at all India level could be 57,000 MW to 76,000 MW, or 20-30% of India\u2019s installed power capacity. The government can encourage rooftop-solar solutions that allow consumers to feed surplus energy to the grid at the same price that they pay for electricity.\u000a\u000aSecond, wastelands and deserts can host solar plants. Four such areas, desert swathes of Rajasthan, the Rann of Kutch and the cold deserts of Ladakh and Lahul-Spiti were identified in this report by the Power Grid Corporation of India. The solar power potential that can be harnessed by using a small fraction of waste or desert land in these four areas could be 284 GW, or 108% of India\u2019s installed power capacity.\u000a\u000a3. Missing manufacturing base: India has limited manufacturing capacities for solar photovoltaic cells, the raw material of the solar-energy industry. To ensure its ambitious solar-energy targets are met, the government is persuading foreign manufacturers to make solar panels in India. During his recent visit to China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw 26 agreements signed between Indian and Chinese firms, four for the manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells in India. Germany, which intends for 45% of its energy to be solar by 2030, promised technical and financial support.\u000a\u000a4. When the sun sets: While the economics and logistics appear to be falling into place, the biggest problem with solar power is that it is generated only during hours of peak sunlight (and wind energy, as we said, only if there is wind). As long as solar-power is small-scale, as it is now, this does not matter. But when thousands of megawatts of solar energy pushes into the grid in great spurts, the grid will need modification. Meanwhile, outside the peak sunshine hours, fossil fuels will still be needed. In theory, batteries can store power, but battery technology has lagged solar-power-generation technology. Even the latest high-storage capacity batteries, most notably a state-of-the-art line launched by Tesla, does not, yet, make economic sense. Until it does, and until this technology is available in India, solar energy can only supplement coal and other conventional power sources, not supplant them.\u000a\u000aIn terms of efficiency, coal\u2013despite its environmental and health costs\u2013is a winner. Generating the same amount of electricity as 1 MW of coal or requires 4 MW to 5 MW of wind or solar power, as we explain in the footnote. This may change, but that is for the future.\u000a\u000aIs India then left with no option but to produce more coal, cause environmental damage (most of India\u2019s coal is under its richest forests), harm more of its citizens and play a major part in making the planet more unlivable?\u000a\u000aA realistic option: Cleaning up India\u2019s coal plants\u000a\u000aUntil solar-generation and battery technology evolves adequately, coal will continue to be India\u2019s energy mainstay. Renewable energy, especially solar, will grow in importance, but India can do much more than it does currently to mitigate the harmful effects of coal.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s coal-fired power plants use poor-quality coal, low on energy content and high on waste, according to a two-year study of 47 Indian power plants (half of India\u2019s installed capacity) by the non-profit Centre for Science and Environment.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a result the coal-power sector is one of the most polluting and resource wasteful,\u201d said the study. \u201cNo country in the world uses coal as poor in quality as India, so our pollution challenges are huge. But our practices to overcome this challenge were found wanting. India\u2019s standards for pollution and resource-use lag far behind global norms, but its power plants fail to meet even such relaxed levels of performance, lacking the basic technologies to control pollution.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf India must use coal, it can reduce the health and environmental impacts by washing the low-quality, high-ash coal used by Indian plants and installing scrubbers in smokestacks, as this 2012 Harvard University study (referred to earlier) showed, analysing emissions of 89 Indian power plants over eight years.\u000a\u000aSulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and fine particulate matter are the chief pollutants from power plants, with SO 2 accounting for 500 of 650 per plant in India, according to the Harvard study. Only one Indian plant (at Dahanu, Maharashtra) had a scrubber to reduce SO 2 emissions, when the study was released, compared to a fourth of all US plants.\u000a\u000aAnalysing the Dahanu plant, a 500-MW plant, another study found the scrubber raised the cost of electricity by 9% but reduced SO 2 emissions by 80%. Examining a much-larger plant, the 2,000-MW plant at Rihand, Uttar Pradesh, without a scrubber, the same study found that washing its poor-quality coal would reduce ash by 35%, save 250 lives annually and raise electricity prices by 16%.\u000a\u000aThese studies make a clear point: India can greatly improve reduce the environmental and health impacts of its dirty coal-fired plants at a marginal to modest increase in the cost of electricity.\u000a\u000aWith electricity demand set to rise from 1,028 billion units (BU) in FY15 to 8,000 BU by 2050, this clean-air investment\u2013as the data we have presented show\u2013should go hand in hand with the push for solar energy.\u000a\u000aIf India is to save lives, clean up its air, create jobs, boost growth\u2013and help save the planet\u2013business as usual is not an option.\u000a\u000a(IndiaSpend is a data-driven, public interest journalism non-profit)

VThe Indian Ocean may be the dark horse in the quest to explain the puzzling pause in global warming, researchers report in Nature Geoscience. The study finds that the Indian Ocean may hold more than 70 per cent of all heat absorbed by the upper ocean in the past decade. Scientists have long suspected that oceans have played a crucial role in the so-called warming hiatus by storing heat trapped in the atmosphere by rising levels of greenhouse gases. But pinpointing exactly which ocean acts as a global air conditioner has proved challenging. Prior research suggested that a significant amount of heat moves from the atmosphere into the Pacific Ocean, where La Nia-like conditions have dominated since the turn of the century. As a result, wind patterns and ocean currents have\u000a\u000aincreased the drawdown of warm surface waters in the subtropics. This process and others enhance ocean heat uptake.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut when Sang-Ki Lee, an oceanographer at the University of Miami in Florida, and his colleagues went looking for this heat beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean, they couldn\u2019t find it. Temperature data compiled by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) World Ocean Atlas (WOA) suggest that the upper 700 metres of the Pacific have actually cooled in recent years, Sang-Ki says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, Sang\u2019s team used a computer model to explore the fate of the ocean\u2019s \u201cmissing heat.\u201d The results suggest that easterly trade winds have strengthened during the hiatus, causing warm water to pile up in the western Pacific. The water seeps between the islands of Indonesia and into the Indian Ocean, bringing heat with it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the model, this surge of water produces dramatic warming in the upper Indian Ocean starting in the early 2000s, in agreement with the WOA data, the authors write. This explanation also fits with measurements of flow through the largest Indonesian channel \u2013 the Makassar Strait \u2013 which increased over the same period of time. \u201cThe big story is that they\u2019ve found the heat,\u201d says Matthew England, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He says the study solidifies the Pacific\u2019s role in driving the hiatus. \u201cIt\u2019s resolving a question that has a lot of people stumped.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHowever, some say the case isn\u2019t closed yet. Sang\u2019s team only analysed trends in the upper 700 metres of the ocean, but \u201cthere\u2019s evidence that a significant part of the heat has been going down into the mid and deeper layers,\u201d says Gerald Meehl, a climate scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Previous studies suggest that one-third or more of the total ocean warming has occurred below the depths considered in the new study.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKevin Trenberth, also a climate scientist at NCAR, says the results disagree with studies that use alternatives to the WOA data. There are large observational gaps in the WOA dataset, and Kevin says that NOAA has accounted for these without considering the long-term warming of the ocean, leading to cooler values where measurements are missing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor instance, Kevin and his colleagues found pronounced Pacific warming during the hiatus and only modest warming in the Indian Ocean using heat content estimates derived in part from satellite measurements. Other studies have also implicated warming in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. For now, it seems that the hunt for the missing heat may continue. But scientists say it is important to get to the bottom of the story to fully explain the current hiatus and prepare for others that might occur in the future. \u201cWe need to understand the energy imbalance of the Earth,\u201d Sang-Ki says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VLONDON/BONN (Reuters) - A global carbon emissions pricing system pushed by top energy companies is unlikely to be a big part of any United Nations\u2019 deal to curb global warming, some experts say, because many countries have little faith in such cross-border initiatives.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll countries are relatively sceptical on international market mechanisms,\u201d said Niklas Hoehne, founding partner of research group NewClimate Institute. \u201cThey are open to have national trading mechanisms or national pricing, but to have these mechanisms internationally, there is a lot of reluctance.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Monday, BG Group, BP, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and France\u2019s Total urged governments to create a global market for carbon emissions, saying this would create a widely accepted price for carbon and help spur low-carbon investment.\u000a\u000aA growing number of investors with trillions of dollars of assets, along with climate change experts and world leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel support the plan.\u000a\u000aBut, wary of the sharp decline in EU carbon pricing, there is little agreement on specifics. Prices in the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System, the world\u2019s biggest carbon market, have dropped from 30 euros a metric ton in 2008 to around 7 euros, due to an oversupply of carbon permits and reduced demand after the economic slowdown.\u000a\u000a\u201cMarkets will have a role to play in lowering the cost of mitigation worldwide ... Exactly how that is going to function and under what rules and what circumstances remains to be decided,\u201d U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said in an interview at a carbon industry event in Barcelona last week.\u000a\u000aKEY APPROACH\u000a\u000aThe draft of the U.N. deal includes an option to acknowledge that \u201ccarbon pricing is a key approach for cost-effectiveness of the cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d but offers little detail on how it might work.\u000a\u000aThe U.N.\u2019s final deal is unlikely to include strong calls for carbon pricing, said officials meeting in the German city of Bonn this week to prepare for the Paris conference.\u000a\u000aSubstantive measures to create an international system may be absent.\u000a\u000aThe Paris accord may do little more than call on governments to nationally implement carbon pricing systems and include a mandate to consider rules for international mechanisms, Hoehne said.\u000a\u000aAround 40 countries already have a price on carbon emissions, covering around 12 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, said the World Bank.\u000a\u000aSome countries questioned the oil companies\u2019 push for carbon pricing.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey spread a lot of misinformation,\u201d said Abdullahi Majeed, environment minister of the Maldives, the Indian Ocean island nation whose low topography makes it a potential victim of rising sea levels. \u201cThis might be an attempt to delay, rather than speed up, work on a Paris accord.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdditional reporting by Susanna Twidale; Editing by David Holmes and Katharine Houreld

VVatican City: The world could see the destruction of entire ecosystems this century without urgent action on climate change, Pope Francis says in a draft of his keenly awaited encyclical on the environment.\u000a\u000aIn the Italian version of the 192-page document, posted on Monday by the weekly magazine l\u2019Espresso, the pope again backs scientists who say global warming is mostly man-made and that developed countries have a particular responsibility to stem a trend that will hurt the poor the most.\u000a\u000aThat position has been contested by conservatives, particularly in the United States, who have excoriated the first pontiff from Latin America for deploying scientific arguments.\u000a\u000aThe Vatican condemned the leak but did not deny the document\u2019s authenticity. It later informed veteran journalist Sandro Magister that his media credentials within the Holy See were being suspended indefinitely because the leak had caused \u201cgreat turmoil\u201d.\u000a\u000aA spokesman said the final version would remain under embargo until its scheduled release on Thursday.\u000a\u000aStill, Italy\u2019s major newspapers published pages of excerpts in their Tuesday editions.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the current trend continues, this century could see unheard-of climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with grave consequences for all of us,\u201d Francis writes, according to the leaked version.\u000a\u000aBy making environmental protection a moral imperative, Francis\u2019 intervention could spur the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics to lobby policymakers on ecology issues.\u000a\u000aThe pope has said he wants the document, called \u201cLaudato Si (Be Praised), On the Care of Our Common Home\u201d, to be part of the debate at a major UN summit on climate change this year in Paris. He said on Sunday the document was addressed to all people, regardless of religion.\u000a\u000aAccording to the leaked excerpts from the pope\u2019s six-chapter document, destined to become a signature document of his papacy, Francis speaks of \u201csymptoms of a breaking point caused by the great speed of change and degradation\u201d.\u000a\u000aIt was not clear how advanced in the writing process the leaked document was nor how similar it would be to the final version. The leaked document bore the pope\u2019s signature in Latin.\u000a\u000a\u201cImmense garbage dump\u201d\u000a\u000aIt confirmed what people familiar with the final version told Reuters last week about how the document addresses climate change and the man-made causes of global warming.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Earth, our home, increasingly seems to be transforming itself into an immense garbage dump,\u201d the pope writes.\u000a\u000aHe confronts climate change deniers head-on, saying there is a \u201cvery consistent scientific consensus that we are experiencing a worrying warming of the climactic system\u201d.\u000a\u000aWhile acknowledging there are other factors, he says numerous studies have shown that global warming is caused by greenhouse gases emitted mainly because of human activities.\u000a\u000aThe encyclical urges rich nations to re-examine their \u201cthrow-away\u201d lifestyle, an appeal Francis has made often since his election in 2013.\u000a\u000a\u201cEnormous consumption in some rich countries has repercussions in some of the poorest places on Earth,\u201d he says, according to the leaked draft.\u000a\u000aThe pope calls for a reduction in carbon emissions, an increase in policies that favour renewable energy and warns of the long-term effects of continuing to use fossil fuels as the main source of global energy.\u000a\u000aHe also rejects suggestions that population control would solve the environmental crisis, saying one of the main causes is \u201cextreme consumerism\u201d.

VThe bottom of the pyramid, which constitutes more than 42 per cent of the global population, is the most vulnerable to climate change risks. The recent disasters that shook Nepal, Bihar and washed away parts of Uttarakhand left us staring at this fact. In these events, the mass majority who were affected were from the poorer socio-economic group. An increasing frequency of epidemics and diseases in this group only make matters worse.\u000a\u000aThrough a differentiated approach, their livelihoods can be secured by providing employability skills and access to finance that would not only lower their vulnerability to climate change risks but also allow them to get on a low carbon growth path.\u000a\u000aThe climate change risks, therefore, have the potential to affect the society in more ways than one, and most of which, we are not, and cannot be prepared for. The issues, if not addressed in due time, can brew social unrest and even act as precursors to the impending wars over the most important of natural resources; water.\u000a\u000aPolicy makers across the world have realised there is a need to move away from traditional welfare models that were based on subsidies or grants, as it became increasingly clear that while these interventions could provide short-term remedies, they cannot be long-term, sustainable solutions.\u000a\u000aThe concerted effort, therefore, needs to be towards empowering the populace on different fronts that can positively impact their livelihood security. Improving their agricultural skills, providing better education and thereby improving their opportunities, facilitating infrastructure to ensure basic amenities, financial inclusion and improving their access to banking, delivering quality healthcare, and most importantly, providing enough food are the needs of the hour.\u000a\u000aCreating enabling environments for the bottom of the pyramid to participate in the mainstream economy has shown to create a longer term economic impact. Livelihood security, thus, becomes a critical component of government policy as it is directly linked to other socio-economic and environmental outcomes in a society.\u000a\u000aIn parallel, climate change is a grim reality and there are millions of Indians at the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) who are earning their livelihood in sectors that are highly vulnerable to climate change risks. Responding to these risks becomes pertinent in India where their livelihoods are negatively impacted whenever disasters such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones and drought strike.\u000a\u000aWe have seen the climatic events affecting economies. The Nepal earthquake that devastated large parts of the country is estimated to cost the nation $10 billion for a recovery. Therefore, the economic activity is by far dependant on the situations of the communities.\u000a\u000aIt is the prime agenda of the government to provide basic amenities to the bottom of the pyramid. While the government has the mandate, corporates can come in here and possibly play a large role in helping the society empower itself and also adapt to the changing environment, and thereby mitigate the risks against it.\u000a\u000aScaling of innovations such water ATMs, healthcare interventions at grassroots, and other effective technological inputs would certainly help achieve livelihood security and also improve the opportunities in these emerging sectors.\u000a\u000aThe 12th Plan (2012-2017) describes skill building as an \u201cinstrument to improve the effectiveness and contribution of labour to the overall production\u201d and \u201cas an instrument to empower the individual and improve his/her social acceptance or value.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, just providing skills without employment could lead to frustration, thus, working towards a scenario where the livelihoods of millions of Indians can be made secure through relevant skill building should become a national priority.\u000a\u000aSimultaneously, it is important that skill building, and through it, livelihood security goals, need to focus on making the BoP resilient to emerging climate change risks, and improve their adaptation to the ever changing socio-economic and environmental scenarios.\u000a\u000aTo achieve these twin objectives, innovative approaches are required. For example, developing skills in sectors most vulnerable to climate change like agri-efficiencies, social forestry, fisheries, integrated water management, solar installations may help address the issue.\u000a\u000aAs an example, approximately 400 million people in India do not have access to electricity as the grid has not reached them. Millions more, while living within the grid, suffer from limited and highly erratic supply due to poor power quality control. Providing off-grid, small scale, renewable energy solutions, based on innovations developed and scaled up at the bottom of the pyramid, can be a long lasting solution that would not only help them meet their energy requirements but also put them a low carbon growth path.\u000a\u000aTo further strengthen the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the largest social security and public works programme undertaken in India, financial training provided through local intermediaries could enhance the positive impact on targeted beneficiaries. The government, in a welcome move, has devised a programme to include 3000 \u201cbarefoot engineers\u201d - girls and boys to be trained towards rural infrastructure and farm productivity, which is certainly a decisive platform to move the rural economy towards a low carbon growth economy while securing livelihoods.\u000a\u000aWith the upcoming COP 21 later this year, where countries would need to take climate action commitments, climate resilience, adaptation and mitigation for India assumes special significance. Large-scale programmes under CSR initiatives, in water conservation and water harvesting, afforestation, micro-irrigation and flood control would support the government\u2019s efforts and enable address domestic challenges.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, opportunities abound for the government to align its latest national skill development goals with its climate goals, and channel its initiatives to build skills that can achieve both aims. In some ways, this is happening already. For example, the Prime Minister\u2019s Kaushal Vikas Yojana, implemented by the National Skill Development Corporation, has included national missions, including National Solar Mission, where the skilled workforce would be channelled into. Today, the need to achieve sustainable, long-term livelihood security through pertinent skill building has turned critical. A CRISIL report estimates that between 2011-12 and 2018-19, 85 million people would be entering the workforce, of which 51 million would be seeking employment. According to the report, the rate at which jobs are being created in the non-farm sector has been falling steady, thus resulting in millions of workers taking up low quality, low productivity jobs, mostly in agriculture.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the large skill gap in India\u2019s working population is exacerbated by the inability of the current skilling infrastructure to provide the necessary skills to so many people. According to a UNDP report, while only 2 per cent of India\u2019s workforce has skills training, the current capacity can only train 3 million of the 12.8 million entrants into the labour force annually.\u000a\u000aRightfully, the government has made skill development a priority, and is working towards developing a \u201cskilling eco-system\u201d on the \u201cSkill, Scale and Speed\u201d plank envisioned by the Prime Minister. This presents a massive opportunity for the private sector to take a lead by channelising its CSR funds in filling this gap, and provide targeted interventions in their sectors of expertise.\u000a\u000aThere lies a huge opportunity for the entire eco-system to be developed in a way that it can help the beneficiaries achieve the dual objective of ensuring a safe and secure future and get on a low carbon growth path.\u000a\u000a(The writer is Senior President & Country Head \u2013 Responsible Banking at YES Bank)

India\u2019s energy-related CO2 emissions are around 30% higher than 2013 by 2022, reaching 2.4 Giga Tonne and go on to exceed 3 GT in 2030,\u201d The WEO 2015 report said.\u000a\u000aThe country will invest $85 billion annually by 2022 in building energy supply infrastructure which will increase to $120 billion in 2030. The power sector alone will account for around 70% of this investment even as the spending on creation of solar and wind capacities will double to $28 billion in 2022.\u000a\u000a\u201cOverall, India\u2019s future power sector investment moves towards a less carbon-intensive path than in the past but investment in coal does not cease and could grow if strong policy signals for low-carbon energy supply were to fade after 2022,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aThe also projected that India\u2019s oil consumption in end-use sectors will grow by 1.4 million barrel per day (mbpd) by 2022 and a further 1.6 mbpd to 2030.

VTo keep the increase in global average surface temperature at 1.5 degree Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 40-70% by 2050,says climate expert Indrajit Bose.\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aAfter G7 countries committed to phase out fossil fuel consumption by 2100 in Germany recently, is it time that India also pursued this goal? While some climate experts argue that should be the case, others say that developed countries have a greater share of responsibility, which they haven\u2019t lived up to as yet, and it is they that need to be pressured to do more.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe long-term goals for decarbonisation in the G7 communiqu are not matched by the pledges on emission reduction that they have tabled for 2020 and 2030,\u201d senior economist Nitin Desai, a member of the Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change, told The Hindu , to a query on whether the G7 countries\u2019 announcement was indeed significant.\u000a\u000aIndrajit Bose, climate expert at the Third World Network, said that the G7 countries had shifted the goalpost to the end of the century which was \u201chighly unambitious.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese countries should have cut fossil fuel consumption long ago. In fact, the latest Structured Expert Dialogue report released in Bonn, Germany, shows that 1.5 degree Celsius is the desired global average surface temperature we should be aiming for and even 2 degree Celsius is unsafe. For this 40-70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are required by 2050, which won\u2019t be achieved by pushing the goal to 2100.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo consensus yet\u000a\u000aAfter the U.S.-China deal on climate change came through in November last year, there have been expectations that India too would commit itself to an emissions target. But no consensus with regard to cutting fossil fuel consumption was reached at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sessions which concluded on June 11 at Bonn, Germany, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), who attended it, told The Hindu.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlthough some streamlining of probable goals did happen, a more concrete document would only emerge in the next session of the UNFCCC meet scheduled in August-September,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aNo headway has also been made in determining India\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) for the 2015 Paris agreement. \u201cAny decision on this front made by India would be keeping in mind our development and growth requirements,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAbhishek Pratap, senior campaigner (renewable energy) at Greenpeace India said that India\u2019s coal consumption had not reached the same levels as China\u2019s for it to commit to a peaking year as China did last year. According to him, for India to be able to phase out fossil fuels it would require financial support from the $100 billion Green Climate Fund available per year till 2020. However, European countries are not willing to extend this assistance, on the grounds that India is a rich country.\u000a\u000aProf. Sudhir Chella Rajan of IIT, Madras who tracks climate policy, said India could nevertheless safely pledge to cut fossil fuel consumption by 2100. But he emphasised that deep emission cuts must come from developed countries like the U.S. \u201cIt is no good saying that the U.S. is constrained by conservative politics. If we have to save the earth, we have to move beyond national politics.\u201d

VWASHINGTON: Ahead of the key Paris climate change summit this year, the US and Brazil today agreed on an ambitious agenda to mitigate the challenges posed by climate change, as they underlined the need for a deal that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn a joint statement, President Barack Obama and his Brazilian counterpart Dilma Rousseff said the Paris outcome should send a strong signal to the international community that governments, businesses and civil society are decisively taking on the climate challenge.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two presidents said they are committed to reaching an ambitious agreement, during the summit to be held in December, that reflects the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRousseff is on a two-day visit to the US. The two leaders pledged to work together toward mobilising public funding and developing financial instruments to catalyse large-scale private investments to support low carbon development projects and countries' transitions to low-carbon economies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile America is the second biggest emitter of Carbon dioxide Brazil is the 13th position.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBoth countries are respectively putting forward strong post-2020 contributions consistent with their determination to show global leadership.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe US intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26 per cent-28 per cent below 2005 levels in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 per cent, the statement said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Brazil will present a fair and ambitious intended nationally determined contribution that represents its highest possible effort beyond its current actions," the statement said adding that it will be based on the implementation of broad policies, including those in the forestry, land-use, industrial, and energy sectors.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNoting that Brazil will pursue policies aimed at eliminating illegal deforestation, coupled with ambitious enhancement of carbon stocks through reforestation and forest restoration, the statement said for that purpose, Brazil intends to restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forests by 2030.

Some international agencies has already accessed funds to work towards climate change mitigation and adaptation,\u000a\u000aMr. Dasgupta was speaking at a climate change dialogue, titled \u201cHow can long-term and sustained financing be structured for mitigation and adaptation\u201d, hosted by the French Ambassador to India here on Monday.\u000a\u000aHe clarified that the fund would be made available to organisations such as NABARD that made development investment decisions and NGOs might not qualify. \u201cThis is not to be confused with development aid money,\u201d he told The Hindu.\u000a\u000aMr. Dasgupta pointed to how the existing funding levels were inadequate to fight climate change. \u201cCountries spend trillions of dollars on waging wars, but they are reluctant to commit more to mitigate climate change and this is an imminent disaster,\u201d he said. While the world GDP is close to 88 trillion dollars as of 2013, the 100 billion dollars committed to fight climate change was only a speck as of now, he said.\u000a\u000aRajasree Ray, Additional Economic Adviser in the Union Finance Ministry, said that during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn in May, the government had sought clarity with regards to the guiding principles, resources and institutional arrangements in place to operationalise the fund.

VIn an effort to scale up India\u2019s renewable energy capacity, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on Tuesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with IIFCL Asset Management Company Ltd. (IAMCL) to provide technical assistance for increasing investment in renewable energy in the country by USD 665 million.\u000a\u000aThe MOU was signed by Manpreet Anand, Deputy Assistant Administrator, USAID Asia Bureau, and E. S. Rao, CEO of IAMCL at their office in New Delhi.\u000a\u000aAs part of the agreement, USAID will provide technical assistance to IAMCL to enhance its institutional capacity to access financial resources from a new class of institutional investors in international markets.\u000a\u000aThe focus of the activities will be on designing, developing, and deploying innovative financing mechanisms that will improve funding for India\u2019s renewable energy sector. In particular, USAID will assist IAMCL in the creation of Green Bonds and Infrastructure Debt Fund-Mutual Fund worth USD 665 million.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a country where 300 million people still live without electricity, this MOU will prove to be a vital step toward improving a student\u2019s ability to study longer; allowing an entrepreneur to extend commerce beyond sunset, helping a mother to give birth more safely, and making our streets safer for all. This MOU will enable India to advance its low-carbon growth and achieve national energy security,\u201d Manpreet Anand said after signing the MOU.\u000a\u000aThe Government of India recently proposed adding 175 Gigawatts of renewable energy by 2022. The ambitious plans by the government for clean energy sources will require the dynamic design and implementation of policies along with new sources of finance to meet larger investment requirements.\u000a\u000aThis MOU between USAID and IAMCL will help drive clean energy development in support of the Government of India\u2019s renewable energy targets.

VAround 300 million people, or a quarter of the population of India, the third largest economy in Asia, do not have access to electricity.\u000a\u000aFatih Birol, chief economist at Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), in an interview spoke about India\u2019s ambitious green energy targets. He said it is achievable with the right regulatory push and incentives for developers.\u000a\u000aBirol also took India\u2019s side in the trade battle between India and the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO), where a dispute settlement panel is hearing the US\u2019s complaints against India\u2019s domestic content requirements for procurement of solar cells and modules under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM).\u000a\u000aHe also said India should leverage the current crude oil price scenario to negotiate better terms and review the Asian premium charged by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).\u000a\u000aEdited excerpts:\u000a\u000aWhile India wants to promote renewable energy sources, it has been taken to the WTO by the US on the issue of India\u2019s domestic content requirements under the country\u2019s solar power programme. India\u2019s large solar targets will also provide an impetus to manufacturing. Your views on the same?\u000a\u000aIt is an issue between the US and the Indian authorities to deal with, but India has all the right to produce its own domestic energy resources, as all the other countries are attempting to do. Especially for India, when the economy is growing, when more than 300 million people have no access to electricity, Indian efforts in that respect are all legitimate.\u000a\u000aWhile renewables will form a part of India\u2019s energy mix, one can\u2019t wish away the conventional sources. In a depressed oil price scenario, how can a country like India\u2014one of the largest energy importers in the world\u2014leverage this opportunity?\u000a\u000aI think India\u2019s growing reliance on oil imports is not only a challenge for the energy sector, but also to the Indian economy in general, both from a market economy point of view and also from an energy security point of view.\u000a\u000aThere are two measures that can be taken to address this challenge. The first one is there is a very strong growth in car ownership in India. This will grow, which is very much in line with other countries. But we have to make sure that the cars and trucks coming on the streets need to have better energy efficiency and fuel efficiency standards... The second one is to replace imported oil and gas with domestic energy sources, such as renewable energy.\u000a\u000aThis renewable energy will also be helpful in making more diversification in the energy mix.\u000a\u000aOf course, it is not expected that renewables will be the magic bullet to solve all of these problems, but they can make a very handsome contribution.\u000a\u000aIndia imports as much as 77% of its energy needs. How can India leverage depressed oil prices to get better terms?\u000a\u000aIndia shall do two things. One, domestically, the other one, internationally. Domestically, the lower oil prices provide a very good opportunity to reduce subsidies given to oil products, which in turn means putting downward pressure on domestic consumption. This will be helpful.\u000a\u000aSecond, India is a major oil importer and the growing oil importing prospects in the current price environment is a competitive advantage when India discusses the future oil contracts with major oil exporters.\u000a\u000aIndia and other Asian countries, such as Japan, pay an Asian premium to Opec. Do you think such a demand from Opec is justified?\u000a\u000aI think when we look at the oil markets, compared to many many years ago when the Asian premium was introduced; when we compare that time with today, many things have changed in the ways of the market in terms of the source of production, the trade patterns and consumption standards.\u000a\u000aThis is a very good time to review this practice and to provide more fair conditions for all parties.

VKOLKATA: To measure the effect of climate change on the flora and fauna of Sundarbans, the Zoological Survey of India has set up monitoring bases inside the mangrove forests.There are 25 plots in the five islands of Bali, Gosaba, Basanti, Sagar and Satjelia where the bases have been set up to measure the diversity and population index of mangroves, crabs and snails."Any change in their population will reveal how climate change is affecting the islands. We will know to what extent the biodiversity is getting affected due to change in the water salinity level and other factors," project in-charge scientist Bulganin Mitra told PTI.The monitoring process is an ongoing one and experts are sent to the spot to collect data about their population and species."We will also take photographs and prepare a GPS map of their habitat. We will prepare a baseline data of biodiversity. As time passes by we will be able to know whether there is any change in the flora and fauna of the region or not," he said.The monitoring bases have so far been established in the buffer zone of the mangrove forest. They have taken permission from the state Forest Department to start more such centres inside the core area of the tiger reserve. UNESCO World Heritage site, Sundarbans is an archipelago of more than a hundred islands, famous for its mangrove forests and several endangered species like the Royal Bengal Tiger, Ganges and Irawadi dolphins.The islands are hit hard by constant land erosion and salinity due to rising sea levels.

Heat bursts are local with a maximum of three km stretch and is very rare. \u201cSince this phenomenon happened all along the coast of the State, we rule out the possibilities of heat burst\u201d, said S Suresh Kumar, Professor and the head of the committee.\u000a\u000aThe interim report pointed out that salt nucleus formed from the salt spray due to strong wind caused the wilting of plants. There is high chance of salt spray. Aerosols with high salt content will be formed by the action of wind on wave surfing. Intermittent rain and sun during this monsoon may have aggravated the situation, the report said.\u000a\u000aScientists also observed that the phenomenon was a gradual process and the public came to know of this only at a later stage. Local enquiry confirmed the occurrence of similar phenomena for the last several years during August \u2013September period, but this year it happened earlier in June.\u000a\u000aThis is more likely to be an oceanic process and it should be studied in detail with reference to atmospheric, oceanographic and chemical aspects, B Madhusoodana Kurup, Vice Chancellor, KUFOS said.\u000a\u000aThe expert committee would conduct a detailed survey on oceanographic aspects such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise, variations in tides etc all along the Kerala coast in long term manner in order to study the impact of climate change and associated phenomena, he said.

V\u201cWe have managed to forge a global consensus on some very crucial issues related to the need for balanced development, and also managed to ensure a commitment of 0.7 per cent of GDP from developed nations towards official development assistance (ODA), so the overall outcome has been quite successful,\u201d Minister of Finance Jayant Sinha, who is leading the Indian delegation to the so-called \u2018Addis Ababa Action Agenda\u2019.\u000a\u000aPart of the United Nations-backed Third International Conference on Financing for Development, the \u2018Agenda\u2019 was to outline measures to generate funds to finance the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals, the successor to the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) that expire this year. Negotiators reached an agreement late on Wednesday night.\u000a\u000aIndia had spearheaded negotiations on behalf of developing nations, which argued that norms on issues like transfer pricing \u2014 or shifting of profits generated in one location to lower tax locations \u2014 currently works to their disadvantage and robs them of legitimate tax revenue.\u000a\u000a\u201cODA globally is $135 billion, whereas various estimates by the UN and other bodies estimate tax revenue lost to poor countries at over $300 billion annually, so the importance of tax revenues far exceeds the potential of ODA to tackle development,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cThe tax-to-GDP ratio in developed economies is 25 to 35 per cent, while it is only 10-20 per cent in poor countries,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAsked whether the outcome could be seen as a win for rich nations, Sinha said the outcome should not be seen in terms of a win or a loss, but by the gains made. He listed the 0.7 per cent GDP commitment to ODA, the reaffirmation of the principle of \u2018common but differentiated responsibilities\u2019 and the agreement to strengthen the current UN tax body as significant advances.\u000a\u000aOn the tax issue, Sinha said the move to give the current UN body on taxation issues a more governmental representation and \u2018equitable\u2019 geographical representation will greatly strengthen the voice of developing nations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe story does not end here. We will continue to push the agenda at other fora like OECD and G20, where India has a significant voice,\u201d he asserted.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s stand has been backed by the thousands of civil society organisations who have gathered at the summit.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes we have had a setback, but seeing developing countries push hard for a seat at the table makes us more motivated,\u201d said Pooja Rangaprasad, policy coordinator for the Financial Transparency Coalition.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, \u201cThis agreement is a critical step forward in building a sustainable future for all. It provides a global framework for financing sustainable development.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Conference is the first of three crucial events this year, the other two being the proposed sustainable development agenda to be adopted in New York in September, and the UN climate negotiations in Paris in December.\u000a\u000aThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda contains more than 100 concrete measures addressing a range of issues including technology, science, innovation, trade and capacity building.\u000a\u000aThe outcome document also underscores the importance of aligning private investment with sustainable development, along with public policies and regulatory frameworks to set the right incentives.

VTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Friday it would slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent by 2030 from 2013 levels and would submit the plan to the United Nations later in the day as its contribution to a global summit on climate change in Paris in November.\u000a\u000aThe target is based on the government\u2019s power generation plan for 2030 that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) finalised on Thursday. The plan calls for relying slightly less on nuclear power than on renewable energy following the 2011 Fukushima disaster.\u000a\u000aUsing 2013 as a baseline, Japan\u2019s 26 percent cut would be higher than an 18 to 21 percent cut by the United States by 2025 and a 24 percent cut by the European Union by 2030.\u000a\u000aJapan - the world\u2019s fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases - saw its emissions rise to 1.41 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, the second-highest on record, in the year through March 2014. That was up 10.8 percent from 1990, reflecting a rise in coal-fired power after the indefinite closure of nuclear power plants.\u000a\u000aGreen activists and some other countries that are calling for even bigger cuts say Japan will be blamed by global communities not only for a low target, but also for plans to build more coal-fired plants at home.\u000a\u000aThe trade ministry on Thursday said the government would plan to make nuclear energy account for 20 to 22 percent of Japan\u2019s electricity mix in 2030, versus 30 percent before Fukushima. It set the target for renewable energy at 22 to 24 percent of the mix, liquefied natural gas at 27 percent and coal at 26 percent.\u000a\u000aJapan\u2019s Federation of Electric Power Companies, whose members include the 10 main power monopolies, and 25 other firms said on Friday they had voluntarily set a goal to curb CO2 emissions per 1 kilowatt of power by 35 percent from 2013 levels to around 0.37 kg in 2030.\u000a\u000aBy installing fossil fuel-fired plants using the best available technology, the power companies see a potential to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 11 million tonnes a year, they said.\u000a\u000aThe Paris summit in November aims to finalize an agreement as part of efforts to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aReporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Tom Hogue

VClimate change has emerged as a major concern in India, according to the findings of a Pew Research Center survey measuring perceptions of international challenges released earlier this week.\u000a\u000aAs many as 73% of Indian respondents, the fourth highest after Uganda (74%), Peru (75%) and Burkina Faso (79%) told Pew that they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about climate change.\u000a\u000aIndia is not alone in expressing its concern over an issue that will be a subject of global focus in the buildup to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December.\u000a\u000aRespondents from a majority of Latin American and African countries cited climate change as their biggest worry at the moment.\u000a\u000aNearly half\u201419\u2014of the 40 countries surveyed by Pew cited global climate change as their primary concern, ahead of the Iran nuclear deal, the Islamic State (IS) terror threat, global economic instability, cyber attacks and tensions with Russia and China.\u000a\u000aThe report says, \u201cIn Peru and Brazil, where years of declining deforestation rates have slowly started to climb, fully three-quarters express anxiety about climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Asia, India leads the way, followed by the Philippines (72%). However, only 19% of respondents from China were concerned about climate change, the survey said.\u000a\u000aIn Africa, \u201cA median of 59% say they are very concerned, including about half or more in all countries surveyed.\u000a\u000aThe other big global threat that has as many as 14 out of the 40 nations worried is the rise of the IS. Most of these nations are in Europe and the Middle East, from where many citizens have travelled over to Syria and Iraq to join IS militants. Lebanon sees the consolidation of IS as its biggest threat. In Europe, the IS is viewed as a major threat in countries like Spain (77%), France (71%), Germany (70%) and Italy (69%).\u000a\u000aBesides European and Middle Eastern countries, the perception of the ISIS as the gravest global danger extends to the United States (68%) and Canada (58%).\u000a\u000aThe report said that 41% of those surveyed from India were very concerned about the IS.\u000a\u000aClimate change and ISIS aside, global economic instability, given the recent situation in first Greece and later China, is cited as a top concern in five countries, mostly in Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine. Nearly half the respondents in India (49%) rated global economic instability as their biggest worry.\u000a\u000aThe historic nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which was struck this week wasn\u2019t seen as much of a threat except, expectedly, in Israel, where more than half of those surveyed (53%) spoke of their worry. Iran\u2019s nuclear deal came in for some strong condemnation from Israel, whose prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it as a \u201chistoric mistake for the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia, with much to gain from the Iran deal, has only 28% respondents perceiving Tuesday\u2019s developments as a threat.\u000a\u000aThe Pew Research Center survey was conducted in 40 countries among 45,435 respondents between 25 March and 27 May, 2015.

VKOLHAPUR: The state government has formulated the first comprehensive policy on renewable energy and has aimed to produce 14,400 megawatt (MW) power through non-conventional sources. The district in western Maharashtra would benefit the most; considering that almost 50% of the state's potential sites for wind energy are here and the sugar mills can go for co-generation plants using bagasse.The state has for the first time considered utilizing industrial waste to generate energy and plans to produce 7,500 MW solar energy. The state policy is in line with the Centre's goal of producing 175 gigawatt electricity using renewable energy resources by 2022.Maharashtra is aiming to achieve the target in next five years; beginning with the current 6,700 MW installed capacity of non-conventional power projects. The Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) believes that the policy would bring a change in the mindset of traditional energy development methods.Industrial experts have welcomed the policy and highlighted the need for ease of doing business and speedy implementation. They also suggested the government to maximise utilization of the solar power resources considering the huge potential in the state."This is indeed first-of-its-kind policy consisting all the six major non-conventional energy sources. At present, we have an installed capacity of 6,700 MW and are aiming to add 14,400 MW in the next five years. The target is huge; however, it is achievable as the policy has been planed meticulously," said S A Patil, general manager of MEDA's power generation department.For instance, since the last decade, sugar factories in the state have experienced the benefits of cogeneration plants and the agency can add 700 MW cogeneration capacity in next few months.Patil said the focus of the policy is on increasing the solar power capacity and creating a new avenue for energy generation from industrial waste. "At certain point, we have to turn to solar and waste-to-energy projects. We believe that the state will lead the country in implementation of the non-conventional energy," he added.Industry expects more than the policy and highlights the need effective implementation of the policy on the line of measures taken by Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan."Any comprehensive policy on the green energy is a welcome step. If we compare Maharashtra with the other three states, we are lagging behind in implementation. Karnataka has implemented reverse metering; means your meter will run in opposite direction the moment you start using renewable energy," said Gaurav Malu, director of the Renewgreen Private Limited, Kolhapur.He sees huge scope for developing solar and wind energy projects in the state; particularly in southern districts. "We have radiation throughout the year and still have not utilised our solar potential. Now, we have to see how the policy gets translated into reality," he added.According to MEDA, the state's wind power potential is 5, 439 MW. The National Institute of Wind Energy has identified 40 sites in Maharashtra, where wind energy can be tapped. Six of these sites are in Kolhapur, Sangli has 7, while Satara has highest 11 sites. In total, almost 50% of the state's wind energy potential is in southern Maharashtra.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAhead of the major UN climate summit in Paris in December this year, India is under growing pressure to announce its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), containing emissions reductions targets, at the earliest date.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, top French climate ambassadors Laurence Tubiana and Nicholas Hulot met with ministers, including Union Environment and Forests Minister Prakash Javadekar, to discuss India\u2019s progress on determining its contributions ahead of the Paris summit. Sources say, both US and French negotiators are keen that India makes some sort of announcement when PM travels to the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September this year. The negotiators said they are hopeful that most of the climate agreement text would be ready by October\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are looking forward to India for leadership on the climate action front,\u201d said Ms. Tubiana, special representative of Laurent Fabius, the French minister of foreign affairs and international development, for the Paris Climate 2015 conference (COP21). While France cannot impose the domestic commitment of various countries - each country will have to commit to its own set of goals for reducing global warming, so as to maintain the global temperature rise to within 2 degrees celcius, Ms. Tubiana said India can really show the way for other participating countries in this regard. She cited the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s encouragement for solar power generation as an instance of the country\u2019s ability to lead the way in climate action.\u000a\u000aIn March this year, the European Union, of which France is a member, announced its INDCs to be at least 40 per cent domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030. India is yet to make its contributions clear.\u000a\u000aSources say the government told the visiting French negotiators that India\u2019s current priority is to give access to energy to about 300 million people, which cannot be achieved without the use of coal. Switching to a low-carbon economic model for developing countries like India would require access to cheap capital by way of climate financing, which India has emphasised earlier as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe G20 summit happening in Turkey in November, a little ahead of the Paris summit, might be a good forum to discuss some of the climate-financing related issues,\u201d Ms. Tubiana said. She also referred to Narendra Modi's reference to the Green Bank and the possibility of the BRICS bank funding green projects. She added that the role of France was to convince partners to invest in green technologies. \u201cWe may need technological leapfrogs, especially in the area of intermittent energy storage, so that countries are ready to switch to a low-carbon economy,\u201d she said.

VKOLKATA: NTPC , India\u2019s largest power producer , has decided to sign fresh power purchase agreements (PPAs) with existing customers and bundle thermal power with solar power in 85:15 ratio. According to a directive issued by the power ministry, utilities will have to compulsorily abide by the arrangement and the ones that decline to take solar power will not be allocated any thermal power.In such cases, NTPC will allocate that power to other utilities. A senior power sector official told ET that at least 9,200 mw of NTPC\u2019s installed thermal power capacities are more than 25 years old and another 3,000-4,000 mw of installed capacities will turn 25 years old in the next threefour years. Power from these plants will be bundled with solar power produced from an existing installed capacity of 110 mw to begin with, the official said.NTPC is in the process of adding 10,000 mw of solar power capacity in the near future and supply from these plants will be added to the bundled supply as and when the power becomes available, the official said. Under the new PPAs, the state-run power producer will charge the average price of thermal and solar power. It will sign new agreements for 25 years, with a provision to review them after a period of 15 years, depending on the condition of the coal-based power stations used for bundling with solar power."Capital expenditure incurred for modernising and renovating these old power plants during the extended period of the PPAs will continue to be considered as additional expenditure for the determination of tariff," the official said. NTPC\u2019s plan to bundle solar power with thermal will help state utilities meet their renewable power purchase obligations which stipulates that utilities will have to source a certain percentage of power it consumes from renewable sources.The renewable purchase obligation, at present, varies between 3 per cent and 10 per cent in different states. In Bihar and Delhi it is 3 per cent, while it is 5 per cent in West Bengal and 10 per cent in Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh.

VNEW DELHI: Sale of renewable energy certificates RECs ) has declined 6.61 per cent to 1.73 lakh in July compared to 1.85 lakh in the previous month.India has two power exchanges approved by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) and Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) -- which hold auction of RECs on the last Wednesday of every month.According to statements issued by two exchanges, sale of 1,73,223 RECs were recorded yesterday including 1,24,824 RECs at IEX and 48,399 RECs at PXIL. Last month, 1,85,493 RECs were sold at the auction."The REC trading session on July 29 at IEX witnessed participation mainly from Captive Power Producers (CPPs) and Open Access consumers while majority of the distribution companies, that have the highest obligation to fulfill amongst all the obligated entities, continued to keep away from the Market," IEX said in a statement.It further said that yesterday's session saw trade of 1,24,824 RECs with an overall market share of 72 per cent.In comparison to previous fiscals, this fiscal the market started on a high note mainly on account of Supreme Court's judgement directing the Captive Power Producers to comply with Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).The market volume, however, decreased 17 per cent in July over the previous month when a total of 1,50,862 RECs were traded at IEX, it said in the statement.The total cleared volume on PXIL was 48,399 RECs that led to the exchange having a market share of 27.90 per cent, PXIL said in a statement.Prior to the auction, more than 1.45 crore RECs were available in the market for trade. However, the traded volume is low on account of non fulfilment of RPO compliance by major utilities, it added. IIt said that the traded volumes are expected to increase in the coming months as many obligated entities would start purchasing RECs to meet their RPO targets.RPO is an obligation mandated by Central/State Regulatory Commission and is applicable to power distribution companies, open access consumer and captive consumers. They are under obligation to buy RECs from renewable energy producers to meet this norm.

VWe examined not just forests but all vegetation, and included areas under Pakistan and China as well for the study.\u000a\u000aIrfan Rashid and team, IISc Bangalore, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad and Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, Srinagar\u000a\u000aThe Research: Studying the impact of climate change on vegetation in J&K by understanding the terrestrial changes that could be triggered by environmental factors\u000a\u000aMany studies have indicated that the Himalayan region is extremely sensitive to climate change. Earlier, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) had done a study that mapped the vulnerability of Indian forests to climate change. This study indicates that the forests of northwestern Himalayas are particularly vulnerable.\u000a\u000aTaking the IISc research forward, we decided to conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of climate change on the vegetation of J&K. We examined not just forests but all vegetation, and included areas under Pakistan and China as well for the study.\u000a\u000aTo extrapolate what the vegetation of J&K would be like in the future under different climatic conditions, we needed to be completely sure of our computer model and whether it reflects the present vegetation pattern accurately. We chose a numeric global vegetation model called IBIS (Integrated Biosphere Simulator) which indicates the kind of terrestrial changes that are likely to happen in response to environmental transformations.\u000a\u000aWe ran the model with inputs like temperature, precipitation, humidity, and soil nutrients from the last 200 years, after splitting the area under study into 0.5 degree grids. We assumed that the vegetation in each of these grids would be common. We also looked at long-term temperature and precipitation trends observed in these regions for which we chose Pahalgam and Gulmarg stations of the Met department.\u000a\u000aWhen we were reasonably sure that an equilibrium had been reached, we compared the results with an actual map of the area using the data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Our simulated vegetation showed an 87 per cent match with the actual vegetation on ground which was very encouraging. It meant that our model now accurately represented the vegetated landscape of Jammu and Kashmir and could be relied on for predicting the \u201cfuture\u201d vegetation affected by climate change.\u000a\u000aWe decided to look at changes by the mid and end of this century, and picked two scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latest report, as our inputs. In the first scenario, the average rise in global temperature is 4.5 degrees and in the second, the temperature rises by 8.5 degrees, which is also the worst case scenario.\u000a\u000aOur results show that vegetation in Jammu and Kashmir could be drastically altered by the end of the century, predominantly due to rise in temperatures in the region. The vegetation in the alpine areas (3,000 m above mean sea level) is predicted to undergo massive change in terms of species composition. There is also a very high possibility of proliferation of alien plant invasions (exotic plant species which compete with the native species) owing to the rising temperatures. Scientific studies in the region indicate that such invasive species can wreak havoc on both terrestrial as well as lake ecosystems across the Kashmir Himalayas.\u000a\u000aOur results are consistent with fears about the impact of climate change in other parts of Himalayas. We have, for the first time, produced comprehensive empirical evidence to suggest what is likely to happen to the vegetated landscapes in the area by the end of this century.\u000a\u000aFor your research to be considered for this column, please write to Senior Editor Amitabh Sinha, who curates this column, at amitabh.sinha@expressindia.com\u000a\u000aFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App

VKOLKATA: PR-Sanjiv Goenka Group flagship company CESC will invest Rs 3,000 crore in renewable energy over the next 18 months.\u201cIn the next level of expansion, we will invest in 500 MW solar and wind power,\u201d CESC chairman Sanjiv Goenka said on Friday. Spread across Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the projects will commence in six months.CESC\u2019s current generation capacity is skewed heavily in favour of thermal power. Of 2,599 MW, renewable accounts for only 75 MW with thermal power accounting for 2,524 MW. The company currently generates 50 MW from wind power units in Rajasthan and Gujarat and 25 MW from solar units in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.Goenka also hinted at the demerger of Spencer\u2019s retail from CESC shortly as the wholly-owned subsidiary registered operating profit for the first time ever in May, 2015.\u201cWe think we are very close to that (demerger) with Spencer\u2019s achieving break-even in May. Hopefully, soon it will be sustainable and we will go ahead with the plans,\u201d said Goenka, adding that the company was evaluating various options for listing including initial public offering (IPO) or mirror-image demerger from CESC where the demerged entity will be automatically listed.CESC on Friday also reported a near-flat net profit of Rs 152 crore in the quarter ended June, 2015 compared to corresponding period of previous fiscal, impacted by lower sales but higher margin.Net sales for the period stood at Rs 1,689 crore, down 8.6% from the corresponding period of 2014-15. Operating profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was up 2% year-on-year at Rs 386 crore, and margin expanded by 240 basis points to 22.7% on the back of lower fuel cost and employee expenses.

As per NTPC bill, the total power procurement from these stations comes to Rs 7.22 per unit including capacity charge of Rs 2.80 per unit and energy charge of Rs 4.42 per unit.\u000a\u000aOdisha has also sought allocation of funds from the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) for promotion of renewable energy projects in the state. The government of India has been collecting a central cess on coal towards National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) to be used for research and development activities. The NCEF corpus had touched Rs 10,127 crore (as on March 2014) and is expected to have grown by another Rs 6,800 crore by the end of March 2015 with the doubling of cess on coal from Rs 50 to Rs 100 per tonne.\u000a\u000aWhile coal rich states have been contributing to the enrichment of NCEF funds, the beneficiaries have generally been the western states where NCEF corpus has been used to facilitate generation of solar energy in a big way.\u000a\u000aState owned Odisha Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) is planning to establish 600 Mw pump storage hydro power plant at Upper Indravati hydro electric project at a cost of Rs 1600 crore to address the peak power requirement in the state.

VI find myself getting more and more depressed as I read reports of preparations for the Conference on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris at the end of the year. The tu-tu-main-main, tit for tat arguments go on, with every nation trying to protect its right to continue growing energy-overload, consumption-centred, nature-extractive economies. US President Barack Obama has made a concession by announcing national standards to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants but this has been dismissed by The Economist as \u201cNecessarily pragmatic and tellingly modest\u201d.\u000a\u000aAnyhow, America\u2019s politics might well derail the implementation of those standards. Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, is recommending India distances itself from its traditional allies, the poor, to join hands with other coal-rich nations in order to protect the extraction of that, the dirtiest of fuels. According to Shyam Sharan, who was former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s advisor on climate change, the Paris convention is unlikely to achieve its target of keeping the global temperature\u2019s rise below two degrees.\u000a\u000aIn all this bargaining, the root cause of climate change has been ignored, and that\u2019s why I am depressed. That cause is economics based on the concept that we humans are lords of the world and so we can do what we will with everything in it. These economics have arisen from an attitude to nature which Rabindranath Tagore pointed out is different from India\u2019s tradition. The polymath said, \u201cThe west seems to take pride in thinking that it\u2019s subduing nature as if we are living in a hostile world where we have to wrest everything we want from an unwilling and alien arrangement of things. India puts all her emphasis on the harmony that exists between the individual and the universal.\u201d\u000a\u000aClimate change has been created by subduing nature. We treated air as a garbage dump because we didn\u2019t consider the need to live harmoniously with it. Deforesting the land, obliterating our fellow species and denuding the sea of fish are only three of many more examples of our hostility to nature.\u000a\u000aThis hostility underpins the dominant school of economics. But there are many economists who, seeing the result of following the dominant school, disagree with it. One of the world\u2019s leading experts on sustainable development, Jeffrey Sachs, has described America\u2019s economy as \u2018an economy of hype, debt, and waste, that has achieved economic growth and high incomes at the cost of extreme in income inequality ...\u2019\u000a\u000aThe western attitude to nature Tagore describes has led to the climate crisis. This attitude is often blamed on Christianity with its tradition that God has given humans dominion over his creation. But now in a historic encyclical little noticed in India, Pope Francis has brought the Roman Catholic Church round to the traditional Indian point of view. He has said Christians who interpret the biblical creation story to justify dominion over the world are wrong. We should \u201cspeak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relations with the world\u201d, Pope Francis says.\u000a\u000aSomething very similar was said by the Jan Sangh ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay, whose thinking is influential in the BJP and admired by many outside that party. He believed independent India should aim at \u201cthe creation of a Bharat which will enable every citizen to achieve a sense of unity with the entire creation\u201d.\u000a\u000aIn his recent book India 2050, A Roadmap to Sustainable Prosperity, the economist Ramgopal Agarwala has pointed out the \u201cearth\u2019s natural resources are just not enough for 1.5 billion Indians consuming nature\u2019s resources at the rate that is done in today\u2019s high-income countries\u201d.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Narendra Modi regards Upadhyay as the Yug Purush, the man of the age. He should have the support of his colleagues in the BJP and the RSS because, as Tagore pointed out, he would be following the Indian tradition. But the arguments in the run-up to the Paris conference indicate that once again the chance to use the climate crisis as an opportunity will be lost \u2014 an opportunity to get people to at least think that maybe they would be happier if their lifestyle did not consume so much of nature\u2019s resources, if they became her friend rather than her enemy.\u000a\u000aThe author's views expressed are personal.

VWASHINGTON: Wikipedia entries on politically controversial scientific topics such as global warming can be unreliable due to information sabotage, a new study has claimed.Researchers analysed Wikipedia edit histories for three politically controversial scientific topics (acid rain, evolution, and global warming), and four non-controversial scientific topics (the standard model in physics, heliocentrism, general relativity, and continental drift)."Wikipedia's acid rain entry receives near-daily edits, some of which result in egregious errors and a distortion of consensus science," said Dr Gene E Likens, President Emeritus of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and a Distinguished Research Professor at the University of Connecticut In an effort to see how Wikipedia's acid rain entry compared to other scientific topics, Likens partnered with Dr Adam M Wilson , a geographer at the University of Buffalo Using nearly a decade of data, Likens and Wilson teased out daily edit rates, the mean size of edits (words added, deleted, or edited), and the mean number of page views per day.While the edit rate of the acid rain article was less than the edit rate of the evolution and global warming articles, it was significantly higher than the non-controversial topics, researchers said.Across the board, politically controversial scientific topics were edited more heavily and viewed more often."Wikipedia's global warming entry sees 2-3 edits a day, with more than 100 words altered, while the standard model in physics has around 10 words changed every few weeks," Wilson noted."The high rate of change observed in politically controversial scientific topics makes it difficult for experts to monitor their accuracy and contribute time-consuming corrections," he said."As society turns to Wikipedia for answers, students, educators, and citizens should understand its limitations when researching scientific topics that are politically charged."On entries subject to edit-wars, like acid rain, evolution, and global change, one can obtain - within seconds - diametrically different information on the same topic," said Likens.Researchers note that as Wikipedia matures, there is evidence that the breadth of its scientific content is increasingly based on source material from established scientific journals.They also note that Wikipedia employs algorithms to help identify and correct blatantly malicious edits, such as profanity.But in their view, it remains to be seen how Wikipedia will manage the dynamic, changing content that typifies politically-charged science topics.The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

VAGRA: In a bid to provide eco-friendly and cost effective intra-city bus services, the Union ministry of road transport is set to provide 30 electric-powered buses to select cities across country soon. After months of lab trials by Bangalore Road Transport Corporation, the government wants to start trial of these buses on the road to find out the cost of operations and practical feasibility of the concept.Of the 30 buses, seven will ply in UP \u2014 at Agra, Meerut, Lucknow, Varanasi, Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Kanpur. Speaking to TOI, UPSRTC general manager Vineet Seth said, \u201cThe idea is to replace fossil fuel technology with eco-friendly technology, where buses will be recharged at terminals during the night and run the entire day without recharging.\u201dSeth said, \u201cAt an International Conference and Exhibition on Public Transport Innovation held in Delhi on August 13 and 14, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced that electric-powered buses would be provided to some proposed smart cities across the country.\u201dSpeaking on the occasion, organized to mark the golden jubilee celebration of the Association of State Road Transport Undertaking (ASRTU), which was established on August13, 1965, Gadkari laid emphasis on the use of bio-diesel and other alternative fuels to reduce emission and hence air pollution. He said bus service providers should adopt new technologies such as GPS-based systems, passenger information systems, CCTV cameras, automatic fare collection system and electronic ticket vending.If UPSRTC sources are to be believed, the corporation is eager to replace CNG and diesel-run city buses with electric-powered buses before 2016-end. This would not only reduce pollution levels, but will also cut the overall cost of operation in the long run. In June, the corporation had sent a group of nearly 20 officials from different regions to European countries like Italy, Switzerland and France to study public transportation systems in those countries and gather knowledge about new and eco-friendly technologies.Ravinder Singh, service manager of Agra roadways and the man behind this idea in UP, said, \u201cAt present, we have to spend about Rs 25 a km to run CNG buses. If we use electric buses, the cost will come down to Rs 7 a km. A feasibility study in this regard was done in Bangalore and it proved effective. The idea is to remove carbon footprints and at the same time use minimum power to run our vehicles. The buses will be charged at stations during the night or at bus stops during the day. This way we would not require overhead wires or electric tracks on roads.\u201d

VWe were told that this government was going to be different\u2014one characterized by steadfastness of purpose, and, pointedly, without the ongoing spectacle of sensitive documents leaked to the press and a parade of senior government ministers and officials speaking out of turn on matters not necessarily within their remit. These were, indeed, among the pathologies that disfigured the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, and they helped foster the impression of a government which didn\u2019t know its own mind, and, once it had figured out what it wanted to do, couldn\u2019t act upon it.\u000a\u000aAlas, it now appears that the current Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government has succumbed to the same disease. In a column devoted principally to missteps of the finance ministry on matters such as the Minimum Alternate Tax, I noted in passing the appearance of leaks from within North Block that threatened to undermine the credibility of finance minister Arun Jaitley.\u000a\u000aThe finance ministry is once again the locus, if not necessarily the source, of another, potentially seriously embarrassing, leak: a private memorandum from chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Jaitley arguing the case for a major overhaul in India\u2019s negotiating position in the lead-up to the global climate policy summit set for Paris later this year. A copy of the memorandum was seen by Business Standard\u2014we do not, of course, know the source of the leak\u2014and snippets from it were shared by the journalist who broke the story. I have not myself seen the document in question, so my comments on it will necessarily reflect those portions of it that the journalist and his editor chose to share with their readers.\u000a\u000aQuite apart from the substance of Subramanian\u2019s recommendations, to which I shall return, the potentially most damaging aspect of the leaked note is that, if it forms the basis of the government\u2019s negotiating strategy in the lead-up to, and in, Paris\u2014that remains a big if\u2014India will already have tipped its hand to our negotiating partners on what is, and is not, deemed negotiable, and what are the \u201cred lines\u201d that will not be crossed. In a game of poker, players hold their cards facing in, and not out, for a good reason.\u000a\u000aTo take an example, Subramanian argues\u2014taking at face value the redacted version of his note that was published in Business Standard\u2014that issues such as climate finance by advanced economies to support developing economies, the differential obligations of advanced and developing economies, and the emphasis on adaptation to climate change in lieu of mitigation efforts are all \u201cless vital interests\u201d for India than they might presumably be for poorer developing and frontier economies. He adds: \u201cThese issues can be used as bargaining chips in the final negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs it happens, such views are congruent with ideas that Subramanian has put forward in previous academic, policy and public writings, and hinted at in the chapter on climate change in the Economic Survey\u2014although the inset box 8.2 dutifully pays homage to the government\u2019s official stance\u2014and, therefore, at some level, should not be particularly surprising.\u000a\u000aFor the record, I agree with Subramanian that it is high time we ditch the rhetoric of asking advanced economies to pay for our climate change efforts, as it largely plays to the gallery back home and leads to little, if any, substantive gain. I also agree with him that India ought to be wary of putting itself into the same boat as China, in particular, a point that I had argued earlier.\u000a\u000aI disagree with Subramanian, however, on the need to shift from piecemeal adaptation to more concerted mitigation efforts, and believe this is unwise for an economy which needs to grow rapidly\u2014 a process which, whether anyone likes it or not, is going to be carbon-intensive. Tying our hands prematurely to excessively stringent greenhouse gas mitigation goals will make our friends in the non-governmental organization community happy, but would be disastrous for our development prospects.\u000a\u000aSuch debates are all legitimate fodder equally for academic seminars as well as for the Delhi and Mumbai cocktail circuits. But there is a world of difference between putting forward such proposals in the context of an academic or public debate on climate change policy or in a newspaper op-ed, on the one hand, versus these ideas\u2014already leaked publicly \u2014being adopted as government policy\u2014 if, indeed, that happens (which will need the approval of a revised Cabinet note).\u000a\u000aIt will be akin to a poker player sharing his or her betting strategy with the other players, before the game begins. The only winners are our negotiating partners in Paris, who will have a window into our putative negotiating strategy, at least as conceived by the chief economic adviser.\u000a\u000aOf course, implausible as it sounds, you might think that the leak itself was deliberate, and represents a clever move intended to obfuscate and befuddle our negotiating partners. You might very well think that. I could not possibly comment.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEvery fortnight, In the Margins explores the intersection of economics, politics and public policy to help cast light on current affairs.\u000a\u000aComments are welcome at views@livemint.com.

VWASHINGTON \u2014 With melting glaciers and rising seas as his backdrop, President Barack Obama will visit Alaska next week to press for urgent global action to combat climate change, even as he carefully calibrates his message in a state heavily dependent on oil.\u000a\u000aObama will become the first sitting president to visit the Alaska Arctic when he travels to Kotzebue \u2013 population around 3,000 \u2013 just north of the Arctic Circle at the end of his three-day trip. He\u2019ll kick off the visit Monday with a speech to a State Department-hosted conference on climate change and the Arctic.\u000a\u000aThe unambiguous goal of the president\u2019s trip is to use dramatic and alarming changes to Alaska\u2019s climate to instill fresh urgency into his global warming agenda. Sea ice is melting, critical permafrost is thawing and Alaska\u2019s cherished glaciers are liquefying \u2013 powerful visuals that Obama hopes will illustrate the threat to natural wonders and livelihoods and serve as a global call to action.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is all real,\u201d Obama said in his weekly address released Saturday. \u201cThis is happening to our fellow Americans right now.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet Obama has taken steps that show he\u2019s cautiously navigating the competing environmental and energy interests at play. A few weeks ago, his administration gave Royal Dutch Shell a final permit to drill into oil-bearing rock off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast for the first time in more than two decades.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has made great strides in protecting the Arctic, but we are really disappointed with this decision,\u201d said Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society. \u201cThis is a point where we disagree.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor many Alaskans, though, the issue comes down to dollars and cents. Both the state government and its residents rely deeply on oil revenues to stay afloat, and falling oil prices have already created a serious budget deficit.\u000a\u000aBrian Deese, Obama\u2019s senior adviser, sought to strike a balance between Alaska\u2019s economics needs and the president\u2019s goal to eventually phase out fossil fuels. \u201cThat\u2019s a transition that is not going to happen overnight,\u201d Deese said. In the meantime, he added, \u201coil and gas will remain important parts of our overall energy mix.\u201d\u000a\u000aAhead of Obama\u2019s visit, state Republican leaders emphasized the need for more energy development and urged Obama not to exploit the state\u2019s stunning scenery for political purposes. Sen. Dan Sullivan warned that any national or ocean monument designations \u201cwill go over like a lead balloon\u201d among Alaska\u2019s Democrats and Republicans alike.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat there\u2019s concern about is that he\u2019s going to use Alaska as some green screen for climate change, when he doesn\u2019t take the opportunity to dig into other issues that are important to Alaskans, important to the country,\u201d Sullivan said in an interview.\u000a\u000aObama has been investing time on an unfinished global climate treaty that nations hope to finalize in December, as he works to secure his environmental legacy before his presidency ends. The president has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and plans to use the Alaska visit to build public pressure on other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.\u000a\u000aAfter arriving in Anchorage on Monday afternoon, Obama plans to meet with Alaska Natives before addressing the Arctic climate resilience summit, dubbed GLACIER, which involves Arctic and non-Arctic leaders, scientists, environmental advocates and the energy industry. Secretary of State John Kerry, a key player in the climate treaty talks, also plans to speak.\u000a\u000aIn an unusual presidential photo-op, Obama will travel Tuesday to Seward, on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula, where the Exit Glacier is retreating in what environmentalists say is a dramatic sign of warming temperatures. After hiking to the glacier, Obama is to board a U.S. Coast Guard vessel to tour Kenai Fjords National Park.\u000a\u000aHis visit continues Wednesday in Dillingham, in southwest Alaska, where Obama will meet with fishermen locked in an ongoing conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery. Then he\u2019ll fly north to Kotzebue, a regional hub in the Alaska Arctic, where Obama will focus on the plight of rural, native villages where livelihoods are threatened by encroaching climate change.\u000a\u000aWhile in Alaska, Obama is likely to face calls from Democrats and environmentalists to restrict Arctic drilling and to renew his request to Congress to make more of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, off-limits as well. Republicans and energy advocates planned to urge the president to clear the way for more drilling.\u000a\u000aAside from brief campaign stops, few presidents have spent significant time in Alaska. President Warren Harding, shortly before his death in 1923, toured nine Alaska communities in three parts of the state.

VJORHAT ( ASSAM ): As climate change is affecting both quality and production of tea, scientists are testing which botanical varieties of the crop are resilient to climatic pressures.At Tea Research Association 's Tocklai Experimental Station here, a team of scientists has created chambers where they are studying how the 200-odd varieties of tea found in the country would react under different climatic models."We are testing the field varieties and we have also created 33 clones so far of the mother varieties. We are testing them all over a period of time to see how they perform under changes in weather," TRA's deputy director Rajiv Bhagat , who is in-charge of the project, told PTI.By artificially varying the temperature and carbon levels in atmosphere inside the chamber, they are experimenting how the plant would perform in future climatic conditions. They are hopeful of coming out with the results by next year.In the last 100 years, TRA has recorded a drop of 200 mm in average annual rainfall and an increase in minimum temperature of 1.3 degrees Celsius.Erratic rainfall has become another issue in the last 30-40 years. The year 2009 was almost a drought while 2010 had double the rainfall. Tocklai station director N Muraleedharan said unseasonal rains cause a decline in production and if the sky is overcast photosynthesis comes down.While connoisseurs complain of a change in flavour of tea, producers say they are also losing crops."About 70 per cent of my crop in a 1.5 hectare area died this year. They were only 20-year-old bushes which could have easily lived for 40-50 years. As a planter it hurts to lose even one bush," says Raj Barooah director of Aideobari Tea Estate in Jorhat.Assam accounts for over half of India's annual tea output.Barooah, also the chairman of Assam Tea Planters Association , agrees that the weather has become erratic, harsh and unpredictable in the last 10-15 years. "Rainfall is no more evenly distributed as it used to be when I entered into the tea business two decades ago," he said.Incidences of pests and plant diseases have also gone up drastically as a result of increase in temperatures.Tea plantation needs a moderately hot and humid climate and an excess rainfall in the monsoon months of June-September causes drainage problems.

VGrid-connected solar power installed capacity has crossed the 4 GW-mark, according to data released by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.\u000a\u000aAgainst a target of 1,400 MW for 2015-16, the achievement in the first four months of the financial year was 358 MW, or 25 per cent. On the basis of projects awarded in the recent months, both under the federal and States\u2019 schemes, solar industry experts are confident that installations in the current year will exceed 2,500 MW. This contrasts favourably with the 1,112 MW installed in 2014-15 and 948 MW in the previous year.\u000a\u000aSolar capacity reaching the 4-GW milestone is said to be creditable considering that as recently as in 2010, India had only 12 MW of solar capacity.\u000a\u000aThe MNRE has set a target of 100 GW of solar capacity to be achieved by 2022. An ambitious target, and the big question is whether it would be met.\u000a\u000aA Citi group report, titled Energy Darwinism II, has projected that India\u2019s solar installations in 2020 would be 26,523 MW\u2014 a respectable number, but way below the target. Such installed capacity would make India the fourth largest solar market, after China (148,141 MW), Japan (64,863 MW) and the US (64,133 MW).\u000a\u000aWind industry\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWind installations in the first four months of the current financial year were 412 MW, according to the MNRE data. Wind industry experts feel that, due to a variety of factors, the target of 2,400 MW for the full year is not likely to be met.\u000a\u000aThe Citi report forecasts India\u2019s wind capacity at 38,690 MW by 2020. The government\u2019s target for 2022 is 60,000 MW.

VJOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Africa\u2019s future energy mix could include an even higher share for nuclear power than the 9,600 megawatts (MW) already planned, the Business Day newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing an interview with a government official.\u000a\u000aIt said a new version of South Africa\u2019s integrated resources plan, which projects its electricity requirements and suggests the energy generation mix needed, will be released in March.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven that we have a climate change commitment to fulfill, it should not surprise people that the viability of a much larger nuclear contribution in the long term should be tested alongside all other options,\u201d Omphi Aphane, deputy director general in the Department of Energy, told the newspaper.\u000a\u000aAfrica\u2019s most advanced economy is gripped by an electricity shortage and regular power cuts are hurting economic growth and tarnishing investor confidence.\u000a\u000aThe government aims to procure nuclear reactors to generate 9,600 MW by 2030 but the newspaper said that could be \u201cenhanced further\u201d, as the government aims to fulfill its targets to mitigate climate change.\u000a\u000aAnalysts have estimated that the current nuclear building plans could cost as much as $100 billion, making it the country\u2019s biggest ever infrastructure project.\u000a\u000aHowever, Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said neither the price nor the contractor had been determined.\u000a\u000aOpposition parties have expressed concern about the cost and that agreements to build the nuclear plants will be made behind closed doors, without proper public scrutiny.\u000a\u000aChina, France, Russia, the United States and South Korea, as well as Japan and Canada, have all expressed interest in the project and have signed or are close to signing cooperation deals with South Africa on trade and technology exchange.

VSeattle: A few years ago, Melinda and I visited with a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India, one of the most flood-prone regions of the country. All of them were extremely poor and depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families. When the monsoon rains arrived each year, the rivers would swell, threatening to flood their farms and ruin their crops. Still, they were willing to bet everything on the chance that their farm would be spared. It was a gamble they often lost. Their crops ruined, they would flee to the cities in search of odd jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return\u2014often poorer than when they left\u2014ready to plant again.\u000a\u000aOur visit was a powerful reminder that for the world\u2019s poorest farmers, life is a high-wire act\u2014without safety nets. They don\u2019t have access to improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and other beneficial technologies, as farmers in rich countries do\u2014and no crop insurance, either, to protect themselves against losses. Just one stroke of bad fortune\u2014a drought, a flood, or an illness\u2014is enough for them to tumble deeper into poverty and hunger.\u000a\u000aNow, climate change is set to add a fresh layer of risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the decades ahead will lead to major disruptions in agriculture, particularly in tropical zones. Crops won\u2019t grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Pests will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.\u000a\u000aFarmers in wealthier countries will experience changes, too. But they have the tools and supports to manage these risks. The world\u2019s poorest farmers show up for work each day for the most part empty-handed. That\u2019s why of all the people who will suffer from climate change, they are likely to suffer the most.\u000a\u000aPoor farmers will feel the sting of these changes at the same time the world needs their help to feed a growing population. By 2050, global food demand is expected to increase by 60%. Declining harvests would strain the global food system, increasing hunger and eroding the tremendous progress the world has made against poverty over the last half-century.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m optimistic that we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change and feed the world\u2014if we act now. There\u2019s an urgent need for governments to invest in new clean-energy innovations that will dramatically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and halt rising temperatures. At the same time, we need to recognize that it\u2019s already too late to stop all of the impacts of hotter temperatures. Even if the world discovered a cheap, clean energy source next week, it would take time for it to kick its fossil fuel-powered habits and shift to a carbon-free future. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for the world to invest in efforts to help the poorest adapt.\u000a\u000aMany of the tools they\u2019ll need are quite basic\u2014things that they need anyway to grow more food and earn more income: access to financing, better seeds, fertilizer, training, and markets where they can sell what they grow.\u000a\u000aOther tools are new and tailored to the demands of a changing climate. The Gates Foundation and its partners have worked together to develop new varieties of seeds that grow even during times of drought or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar, for instance, are now growing a new variety of flood-tolerant rice\u2014nicknamed \u201cscuba\u201d rice\u2014that can survive two weeks underwater. They are already prepared if shifts in the weather pattern bring more flooding to their region. Other rice varieties are being developed that can withstand drought, heat, cold, and soil problems like high salt contamination.\u000a\u000aAll of these efforts have the power to transform lives. It\u2019s quite common to see these farmers double or triple their harvests and their incomes when they have access to the advances farmers in the rich world take for granted. This new prosperity allows them to improve their diets, invest in their farms, and send their children to school. It also pulls their lives back from the razor\u2019s edge, giving them a sense of security even if they have a bad harvest.\u000a\u000aThere will also be threats from climate change that we can\u2019t foresee. To be prepared, the world needs to accelerate research into seeds and supports for smallholder farmers. One of the most exciting innovations to help farmers is satellite technology. In Africa, researchers are using satellite images to create detailed soil maps, which can inform farmers about what varieties will thrive on their land.\u000a\u000aStill, a better seed or a new technology can\u2019t transform the lives of farming families until it\u2019s in their hands. A number of organizations, including a non-profit group called One Acre Fund, are finding ways to ensure that farmers take advantage of these solutions. One Acre Fund works closely with more than 200,000 African farmers, providing access to financing, tools, and training. By 2020, they aim to reach one million farmers.\u000a\u000aIn this year\u2019s Annual Letter, Melinda and I made a bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with the risks of climate change, that\u2019s a bet I stand by.\u000a\u000aYes, poor farmers have it tough. Their lives are puzzles with so many pieces to get right\u2014from planting the right seeds and using the correct fertilizer to getting training and having a place to sell their harvest. If just one piece falls out of place, their lives can fall apart.\u000a\u000aI know the world has what it takes to help put those pieces in place for both the challenges they face today and the ones they\u2019ll face tomorrow. Most importantly, I know the farmers do, too.\u000a\u000aBill Gates is co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\u000a\u000a2015/PROJECT SYNDICATE\u000a\u000awww.project-syndicate.org

VThe Dutch government is appealing a landmark ruling that ordered it to slash greenhouse gas emissions, in a case seen as a possible precedent for similar legal action around the world.\u000a\u000aThe government announced today it will appeal the June ruling that it must cut emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. But the government added that it also will begin implementing the order while the appeal, which will likely take months or years, is underway.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Mark Rutte's government said it is appealing because it has "question marks about the way the judged Cabinet policies."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe activist group that brought the case said the government does not need to appeal if it only wants to check the ruling's legality.

VUnited Nations: Asserting that the onus of global sustainability cannot be placed on developing countries alone, India has said that sovereign countries should not be subjected to external oversight mechanism to measure their progress in achieving sustainable development goals.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery country faces specific challenges to achieve sustainable development and may follow different approaches, visions, models and tools, in accordance with the national circumstances and priorities.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo I feel no sovereign country should be subjected to external oversight mechanism or benchmark with regard to progress on these goals,\u201d Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said in her address to the Fourth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAddressing the high-level gathering of speakers of parliament from across the world, Mahajan stressed that the \u2018onus\u2019 of global sustainability cannot be placed on developing countries alone and developed countries must lead by example. \u201cA global common approach to sustainability demands that developed countries, which bear the historical responsibility for climate change and have better financial and technological resources, must lead by example.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTherefore a strong global partnership is needed to support the efforts of developing countries in the spirit of \u2018Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u2019 (the entire world is a family) and like interdependence in a family, all must share the responsibility according to individual capacity and capability,\u201d she said in her address titled \u2018Placing Democracy at the Service of Peace and Sustainable Development, Building the World the People Want\u2019.\u000a\u000aShe said while nations aspire to live in a world that is peaceful, provides equality, human rights and dignity of labour and is free from discrimination, poverty and hunger, the question must be asked how democracy can deliver effectively to promote peace and sustainable development.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must empower democracy by ensuring that it is participatory and inclusive to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable sections of society,\u201d she said noting that one of the Sustainable Development Goals seeks to provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Mahajan further said that good governance is an enabler for development.\u000a\u000a\u201cInclusive participation together with good governance will promote peace and sustainable development,\u201d she said.

VIs it climate change? Reaching its likely minimum extent for 2015, Arctic sea\u2019s minimum ice extent was the fourth lowest in the satellite record since observations from space began.\u000a\u000aThe analysis by NASA and the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado at Boulder showed the annual minimum extent was 1.70 million square miles (4.41 million square kilometers) on Sept. 11. This year\u2019s minimum is 699,000 square miles (1.81 million square kilometers) lower than the 1981-2010 average.\u000a\u000aArctic sea ice cover, made of frozen seawater that floats on top of the ocean, helps regulate the planet\u2019s temperature by reflecting solar energy back to space. The sea ice cap grows and shrinks cyclically with the seasons.\u000a\u000aIts minimum summertime extent, which occurs at the end of the melt season, has been decreasing since the late 1970s in response to warming temperatures.\u000a\u000aIn some recent years, low sea-ice minimum extent has been at least in part exacerbated by meteorological factors, but that was not the case this year.\u000a\u000aThis year is the fourth lowest, and yet people haven\u2019t seen any major weather event or persistent weather pattern in the Arctic this summer that helped push the extent lower as often happens, said sea ice scientist Walt Meier, adding that it was a bit warmer in some areas than last year, but it was cooler in other places, too.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, the lowest year on record, 2012, saw a powerful August cyclone that fractured the ice cover, accelerating its decline.

VIndia will negotiate together with a so-called group of like-minded developing countries (LMDCs) at the climate change summit in Paris at the year-end, environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aAt the end of a two-day meeting of negotiators from 13 LMDCs in New Delhi, Javadekar asked rich nations to walk the talk in transferring funds to the poor to mitigate the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aChina, Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, Ecuador, Iran, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Malaysia, Vietnam, Argentina and Saudi Arabia participated in the meeting to draw up a common strategy before an October meeting in Bonn where the negotiating text for the Paris summit will be finalized.\u000a\u000a\u201cLast two days, 13 LMDCs deliberated on each and every aspect of the probable Paris agreement,\u201d Javadekar said. \u201cWe are positive and we want Paris to succeed because we are the countries that are vulnerable... We are ready to cooperate with each other to arrive at a good conclusion.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added: \u201c...if developed world doesn\u2019t walk the talk on issue of finance, there will be a problem for the Paris outcome. I hope the developed world will consider it and rise to the occasion, and we all together will move to a new regime where every country takes voluntary actions (to reduce emissions).\u000a\u000a\u201cIf human intervention has caused climate change, human intervention possibly will contribute in mitigating the challenge,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aJavadekar\u2019s assertion that India would negotiate in Paris together with LMDCs is contrary to the views of chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian that India should align with coal-rich countries and distance itself from poor and developing countries at the talks.\u000a\u000aSubramanian\u2019s stand was first reported by the Business Standard newspaper on 12 August.\u000a\u000aIn a break from India\u2019s carefully built position of common but differentiated responsibilities, Subramanian suggested to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley that India should stop insisting on retaining the way of differentiating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) between rich and developing countries, and stop seeking finance from rich countries.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Javadekar said the core agreement that\u2019s reached in Paris should include all the pillars of UNFCCC.\u000a\u000aIn the evening, the LMDC delegation met Prime Minister Modi, where the PM assured them that India stands shoulder-to-shoulder with them on climate issues.\u000a\u000aHe emphasized on the need for the developed world to fulfil its commitments with regard to sharing clean technology and providing financial assistance to help the developing world combat climate change, while simultaneously meeting its legitimate development aspirations.\u000a\u000aModi said that while developed countries should have targets for emission cuts, developing countries should work on targets of encouragement, such as initiatives towards renewable energy and green buildings.\u000a\u000aSome 190 countries from across the world are scheduled to meet in Paris in December to strike a new global climate deal. By September-end, all the countries have to announce their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), which would form the basis of the December Paris summit.\u000a\u000aINDCs are a set of voluntary actions that each country will announce to address the issue of climate change.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) called a meeting of key ministries like the environment and the new and renewable energy ministries to give shape to India\u2019s INDCs.\u000a\u000aAn environment ministry official, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cIndia\u2019s INDCs are ready and are only awaiting a final nod from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. After final clearance from PMO, the INDCs would come to cabinet for clearance. It is expected before PM Narendra Modi leaves for US next week.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe New Delhi meeting of LMDCs ended with the release of a statement that said the Paris summit should recognize and address the adverse social and economic impact of climate change response measures in developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe delegates agreed that \u201cthe Paris agreement should not be mitigation-centric but must address in a balanced and comprehensive manner the six elements identified in the Durban mandate\u2014mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support, as well as loss and damage in a balanced manner\u201d.\u000a\u000aLMDCs asked developed countries to provide a road map towards the transfer of $100 billion (Rs.6.6 trillion today) in mitigation funds per year by 2020.

VA reduction in floor price and a recent Supreme Court order upholding renewable purchase obligation (RPO) norms have helped improve sales of solar renewable energy certificates, or RECs.\u000a\u000aThe average monthly REC sales on energy exchanges increased from 4,789 units in the first eight months of the previous calendar year to 40,153 units this year. One REC equals one megawatt hour.\u000a\u000aBut the demand is barely sufficient. With new solar capacities and the backlog, the REC sale bids are rising dramatically. In the eight months to August this year, RECs offered on the energy exchanges increased almost 10 times from a year ago. As a result, despite a decent improvement in the monthly sale rate, the offtake ratio or the buy quantity as a percentage of offered quantity remains abysmally low\u2014it stood at 1.6% in August.\u000a\u000aAccording to industry experts, poor compliance with the solar purchase obligation by the obligated entities, especially the state electricity boards, is leading to this problem. Even though the rules and the mechanism are laid out, implementation is lagging. \u201cOnly in few cases, SERCs (state electricity regulatory commissions) have issued stricter directions/penalty to the obligated entities for RPO compliance,\u201d Icra Ltd said in a note.\u000a\u000aExperts hope the Supreme Court order will nudge the obligated entities to step up REC purchases. If it does not take off in a big way, then the REC market can emerge as a weak link in India\u2019s renewable energy strategy.\u000a\u000aSolar energy generators that do not have regulated supply agreements and sell energy in the open market or to a utility will have few means of generating extra revenue or monetizing their green certificates. \u201cIn effect, the revenue will be locked. There will be no takers unless a market-oriented framework is developed. It\u2019s not there right now,\u201d said a person who tracks the sector.

VNEW YORK (Reuters) - Leaders of 11 Chinese cities and provinces are to announce that their carbon emissions will start to fall earlier than China\u2019s national target of 2030 at a U.S.-China meeting on Tuesday, a move meant to build momentum for a global climate change accord in December.\u000a\u000aResidential buildings are seen amid heavy air pollution, in Wuhan, Hubei province, February 16, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer\u000a\u000aThose announcements, as well emission-reduction commitments from more than a dozen U.S. states and cities, will form part of a joint declaration that municipal and regional leaders from the world\u2019s two biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries will sign during a U.S.-China meeting on low-carbon cities in Los Angeles on Tuesday and Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe summit builds on a key climate change deal reached last November between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in which the United States agreed to lower greenhouse emissions as much as 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and China pledged that its emissions would peak by 2030, according to the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe commitments that the Chinese and American cities are taking ... are a very important component of our broader efforts to deepen climate cooperation and to show that ... the two largest emitters in the world are taking seriously our obligation to meet the ambitious goals that we set out last year,\u201d said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama.\u000a\u000aXi is visiting the United States next week, at a time when both countries are sparring over cybersecurity, an issue Obama is expected to raise.\u000a\u000aBut climate change is one area where the two countries largely see eye to eye, a fact the White House is happy to highlight.\u000a\u000aDeese said the actions that local leaders will announce were meant to demonstrate how both countries can implement the national targets they pledged jointly last year.\u000a\u000aTwo of China\u2019s biggest cities, Beijing and Guangzhou, have committed to a peak for their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, 10 years earlier than the national target. Others, including Shenzhen, have pledged to peak by 2022.\u000a\u000aCities and provinces that have made such commitments have formed an Alliance of Peaking Pioneer Cities, which represents one-quarter of China\u2019s urban carbon emissions, or the equivalent of all Japan\u2019s or Brazil\u2019s emissions, according to the White House.\u000a\u000aSome of the biggest critics of President Obama\u2019s climate change strategy in the U.S. Congress had criticized his agreement with Xi last year. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said the pact \u201crequires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years\u201d while U.S. states were forced to cut their emissions.\u000a\u000aCities including Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta as well as states such as California and Connecticut also re-affirmed a variety of climate change goals, including emission-reduction targets, mandates to expand renewable energy, and slashing the use of transportation fuels.\u000a\u000aReporting By Valerie Volcovici; additional reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Kevin Liffey

VNEW YORK: Asking nations to shun negativism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong pitch for a positive agenda to tackle climate change in his talks with US President Barack Obama who said India's leadership at the Paris conference will set the tone for decades to come."President and I share an uncompromising commitment on climate change, without affecting our ability to meet the development aspirations of humanity. We have both set ambitious national agendas," Modi said after his hour-long talks with Obama the focus of which was on climate change.During the talks yesterday, Modi underlined the need for concrete outcomes at the upcoming global conference on climate change in Paris starting November.Briefing reporters later on Modi's meeting with Obama, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said, "As far as the substantive issue of climate change is concerned, the PM made it very clear that the current climate of negativism was not a useful factor as we approach COP21 in Paris.""He (Modi) said that rather than just putting pressure, piling pressure...it would have been far more better if we had a positive agenda which enabled countries to go in for more sustainable paths of development by providing finance and the requisite technology," Swarup said.In a brief statement after the talks, Obama stated that much of his discussion with Prime Minister Modi was focussed on the upcoming climate conference."We are encouraged by the aggressive nature of Prime Minister Modi's commitment to clean energy...I think India's leadership in the upcoming conference will set the tone not just for today but for decades to come," Obama said.Talking about India's aggressive push for the cause of climate change, Modi said, "Our measures include not just a plan to add 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, but a development strategy that will enable us to transition to a more sustainable energy mix.""This is an exercise we are undertaking in the spirit of our culture and tradition, but also because of our commitment to the future of this planet," he said.Modi also thanked Obama for the positive response to his call for a global public partnership for developing affordable clean energy sources that will enable faster adoption of clean energy across the world."We should work together to advance that goal. And, it is equally important to develop mechanisms to ensure that the affordable also become accessible to those who need it the most," Modi said."We look forward to comprehensive and concrete outcome in Paris with a positive agenda on combating climate change, which also focuses on access to finance and technology for the developing world, especially the poor countries and small island states," he said.

This will be to build 7-8 Gw annually, at an average cost of Rs 4-5 a Mw.\u000a\u000a"What is attracting investors is that rates are fixed for the useful life of an RE plant, usually 25 years," says Rahul Mody, managing director of Ambit.\u000a\u000aUBS Investment Bank, financial advisor to for the investment from ENEL Green, is also expecting a surge. \u201cWe have already seen a significant fall in cost of power generation from RE sources,\u201d says Sawan Kumar, executive director. \u201cAs the technology improves, economy of scale comes and efficiency improves. The hope is that cost of renewable power will become equivalent to that of conventional power in the next two to three years. It would also depend, he cautioned, on the behaviour of coal prices.\u000a\u000a\u201dThere are concerns such as grid evacuation and financial health of distribution If these are not addressed simultaneously to the expected capacity addition, then perhaps the payment issues will start,\u201d says Sinha.\u000a\u000aThe rush of foreign investors is also because India is attractive for large in the segment looking to diversify geographically into Asia.

On October 2, possibly will declare its INDC. I believe world would be pleased to look at our contributions," Goyal said here at a function organised by Brooklyn\u000a\u000aAll the countries are required to submit their INDCs on or before October 1, as the crucial 21st session of the conference of the parties (CoP-21) on climate change is to be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11.\u000a\u000aThe conference needs to achieve a new international agreement on climate, applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.\u000a\u000aGoyal said "polluter pay principle" should be adopted in the world and the countries which were "hugely responsible" for the current situation should contribute towards cleaning of the environment.\u000a\u000a"We have not seen the credible affirmative action from the west in this respect," he said, adding despite this would move towards protecting the climate with cleaner environment being the central point of the ministries of power, coal and new and renewable energy.\u000a\u000aIndia was not a large pollution generating country as compared to the developed world, the minister said, adding even the energy consumption was far less as against the economically strong countries.\u000a\u000aHowever, he said coal would continue to be the mainstay of power in India but the pollution level can significantly be kept low with innovative technologies and thrust on renewable energy.\u000a\u000aPublic sector Coal India Limited would produce one billion tonnes of coal by 2019-20, he said, adding that the government was committed to set up washeries on the massive scale to wash 250 million tonnes of coal in next three years.\u000a\u000aGoyal informed that his ministry was framing a policy to liberalize coal linkages within infrastructure companies which will help bring down power cost.\u000a\u000aBy 2030, he said India would be a country of largely modern and efficient coal based plants.

VNEW DELHI: Reacting to the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) announced by India today, green bodies said that it was a much-awaited climate action plan and reflects the country's development challenges, aspirations and the realities of climate change."India's INDC is fair and is quite ambitious, specifically on renewable energy and forestry. It reflects its development challenges, aspirations of large numbers of poor people and the realities of climate change," said Sunita Narain, director general, Center for Science and Environment."From all angles, India's INDC is as good as China's and better than the US's considering that both these countries have higher emissions than India and are economically more capable of reducing their emissions and mitigating climate change," deputy director general, CSE, Chandra Bhushan said.In its INDC, India has pledged to improve emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent by 2030 below 2005 levels. It has also pledged to increase the share of non-fossil fuels-based electricity to 40 per cent by 2030 while also agreeing to enhance its forest cover which will absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, the main gas responsible for global warming by 2030."India has accepted the huge impact that climate change is exerting and will exert on different sectors of its economy and has agreed to enhance investments to adapt in vulnerable sectors like agriculture, water resources, coastal regions, health and disaster management," he said. Greenpeace India has termed the climate targets as 'steps in the right direction'.According to Pujarini Sen, Climate and Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace India, clear articulation of a Renewable Energy target would also have been in keeping with expectations for climate justice, as these are the people most vulnerable to climate change."Given the growth in the renewable energy sector, we would have liked to see a specific target for solar and wind. 40 per cent of electricity from renewable energy by 2030 is definitely possible, especially so with financial and technical support," said Sen.Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA), said that India, through its INDC, demonstrates its willingness to play an important role on the international stage ahead of climate talks in December in Paris."India's signal could no doubt be much stronger, going even further to help the international community avoid unmanageable climate impacts, should the rich and developed countries step up and provide adequate finance and technology support," he said.ActionAid India's Executive Director, Sandeep Chachra said that despite huge developmental challenges, India has put forward a climate action plan that is far superior to ones proposed by the US and EU."India's ambitious focus on energy efficiency and dramatic increase in renewable energy deserves credit but must lead to enhanced energy access for the poor. This clearly puts the onus on developed countries to meet their obligations of providing public finance and technology transfer to developing and least developed countries," he said.India has also rightly put the focus back on the need to adapt to climate impacts, he said."Farming communities, who are already distressed, are suffering even more from erratic and extreme climatic conditions. Changes in India's climate are leading to land and coastal degradation, soil erosion, loss of bio-diversity. Indian government's focus on adaptation therefore comes at a critical time for its population," added Chachra.

VIncreasing coal-based generation may not be an impediment in achieving the green targets, if energy efficiency measures are used, says Ajay Mathur, Director-General of Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Mathur, who will soon take charge as the Director-General of The Energy Resource Institute (TERI), and is part of the Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change, spoke to BusinessLine on how the government\u2019s targets for reducing emission intensity is achievable, if the right steps are taken by all the stakeholders. Excerpts:\u000a\u000aGiven that the intended nationally determined contribution targets for 2030 are higher than what was committed in Copenhagen, how achievable are they?\u000a\u000aCopenhagen\u2019s targets were for 2020. This one is for 2030. So it is doable. But, there would be some special efforts required to do it.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the energy efficiency effort would need to increase. We need good business models for this. What is happening with LED bulbs (light-emitting diode) needs to be replicated for air-conditioners, which is the single largest energy consuming appliance.\u000a\u000aSecondly, we need to promote use of bio-mass. Nearly a fifth of the people use bio-mass inefficiently and if they move to LPG and kerosene it would mean more carbon emissions. There is zero effort right now to use bio-mass efficiently and there needs to be a lot more effort there.\u000a\u000aThird point is for renewable energy, we need good business models to bring down tariffs, yet provide a good return for investors. Finally, a lot of investment needs to go in for research and development for energy efficient equipment. If we do all of these, the targets are c achievable.\u000a\u000aAre we on track to have 40 per cent of the energy mix coming from renewable sources by 2030?\u000a\u000aThe challenge in renewable energy is the business model. A workable business model has to be in place. We have RPO (renewable purchase obligations) which increase volumes and decrease tariffs. Such obligations need to be increased so that investment gets accelerated. People will invest in energy anyway, but the pace needs to increase.\u000a\u000aIndia also plans to ramp up coal-based power generation in the same time period. So how does that fit in?\u000a\u000aIn 2030, the country\u2019s electricity requirement is going to be 3-4 times of what it is today. Today, we require one trillion units of electricity annually. If we are energy efficient we would require three trillion units by 2030, and if not then we need four trillion units. To do that, we will need to set up all forms of electricity generation.\u000a\u000aThe reality is there is a limit to the amount of hydro plants that can be set up due to land acquisition and environmental concerns. There is a limit on gas-based power due to the non-availability of domestic gas.\u000a\u000aNuclear is not easy to set up and there is a lot of opposition to it. So, coal has to form a large part of the energy mix. The good thing is that the INDC says we intend to have more renewable energy capacity addition than coal.\u000a\u000aHow do you think the developed world will view this?\u000a\u000aIt depends on the perspective they have. For energy services, you need energy. What we have to ensure is all new industries, homes, commercial spaces that come up are more and more energy efficient.\u000a\u000aApart from that, if someone was expecting zero coal from us, that is unrealistic and they will be disappointed.

VISTANBUL: India\u2019s pledge to cut emission intensity of its GDP by a third in the next 15 years has won handsome praise from the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also sympathises with the country\u2019s view that developing countries should not foot the entire bill to combat climate change as rich nations polluted the planet for a century.\u201cIt shows that India is a respected member of international community and moves alongside with others\u2014 the developed and developing countries\u2014and plays its role to address one of the biggest challenges we are facing today, namely climate change. So this is definitely a move in the right direction. I commend the Indian government for taking this position,\u201d IEA executive director Fatih Barol told ETon the sidelines of the G-20 Energy Ministers Conference in Istanbul.Barol was also sympathetic about India\u2019s view that rich countries need to help developing countries in combating climate change. \u201cI hope that we will have an agreement in Paris this year, and we can only have an agreement in Paris if all the developed and developing countries come together,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to be frank. When we look at the emissions in the last 120 years, bulk of the emissions came from the developed countries, and it will be unfair if countries with lower income to get the biggest share of that burden.\u201dHe said regions like Africa had a share of barely 3% of global emissions, but consequences of climate change will be felt most in the continent. \u201cThat\u2019s a very unfair situation. So I hope in Paris we have an agreement, which is global and is also fair based on the past responsibilities and means of the countries taken into consideration,\u201d he said. IEA, the energy watchdog of the developed world, also praised the Narendra Modi government for its ambitious solar energy programme.India wants non-fossil fuels to account for 40% of installed capacity in 15 years with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, including from Green Climate Fund.\u201cI think the Modi government shows that energy is one of the key priorities for the economic growth of India. This makes me very happy, as an energy man. I believe making most of the domestic sources, including solar, is a very wise move. And at the same time India is pushing the button to use energy more efficiently, and as a result of that India came up with a pledge,\u201d Barol said. India has faced criticism that it hasn\u2019t announced a date when emissions would peak, but the IEA chief was sympathetic.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t compare different countries. Every country has its own domestic situation, economic development levels. I wish to see that all the countries make their best in order to reduce emission. And at the same time by making those efforts they will also reduce local pollution. Indian government is making all the efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of Indian energy sector and at the same time have growth. So growing emphasis of the Modi government on solar power and energy efficiency is very much appreciated,\u201d he said.Ambitious and achievableIndia\u2019s INDC is both ambitious and achievable. New Delhi is building on its 2020 target to reduce the amount of GHG emissions produced for every dollar of economic output. As a result of the efforts outlined in the INDC, India will have a per capita emission of 3.5 tonnes in 2030. While the US and China will both have per capita emissions of 12 tonnes. New Delhi has sought to chart a development path that is cleaner, while at the same time it is mindful of the vast unmet developmental needs of its people.(The author travelled to Istanbul on the invitation of the Turkish G-20 Presidency)

VGlobal sea levels will rise substantially more than previously thought and almost irreversibly if greenhouse gas emissions continue, according to New Zealand-led research released on Thursday.\u000a\u000aAn international team led by Nicholas Golledge, of Victoria University\u2019s Antarctic Research Centre, used state-of-the-art computer modelling to simulate the Antarctic ice-sheet\u2019s response to a warming climate under a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios.\u000a\u000aThey found that all but one of the scenarios, that of significantly reduced emissions beyond 2020, would lead to the loss of large parts of the Antarctic ice-sheet, which in turn would result in a substantial rise in the global sea-level, Xinhua reported.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe long reaction time of the Antarctic ice-sheet, which can take thousands of years to fully manifest its response to changes in environmental conditions, coupled with the fact that CO2 (carbon dioxide) lingers in the atmosphere for a very long time means that the warming we generate now will affect the ice-sheet in ways that will be incredibly hard to undo,\u201d Golledge said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIn its 2013 Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that the Antarctic ice-sheet would contribute only 5 centimetres to global sea-level rise by the end of this century even for its warmest emissions scenario.\u000a\u000aBut Victoria University professor Tim Naish, who was a lead author of the IPCC report, cautioned that at the time the report was written there was insufficient scientific knowledge on how the Antarctic ice-sheet might respond to future warming, meaning the IPCC sea-level projections could have been too modest.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur new models include processes that take place when ice-sheets come into contact with the ocean. Around 93 percent of the heat from anthropogenic global warming has gone into the ocean, and these warming ocean waters are now coming into contact with the floating margins of the Antarctic ice sheet, known as ice-shelves,\u201d said Golledge.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we lose these ice-shelves, the Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise by 2,100 will be nearer 40 centimetres.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo avoid the loss of the Antarctic ice-shelves, and an associated commitment to many metres of sea-level rise, the study showed atmospheric warming needed to be kept below 2 degrees centigrade above present levels.\u000a\u000a\u201cMissing the 2 degrees centigrade target will result in an Antarctic contribution to sea-level rise that could be up to 10 metres above present day,\u201d said Golledge.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe stakes are obviously very high, 10 percent of the world\u2019s population lives within 10 metres of present sea level.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo restrict global warming to 2 degrees centigrade and prevent the more dangerous consequences of climate change, the United Nations climate change meeting in Paris later this year should agree to reduce global CO2 emissions to zero before the end of the century, Naish said in the statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be on track this will require a global commitment to 30 percent reduction, below year 1990 levels, by the year 2030.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe last time CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were similar to present levels was about 3 million years ago, when sea levels were 20 metres higher than now, said Golledge.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Trending News, download Indian Express App\u000a\u000a IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd

Vis widely recognised as one of the most powerful tools for combating transfer (and associated financing) has been a key demand during two decades of climate negotiations, including for the upcoming negotiations in Paris. But there is still limited understanding of what works and what does not.\u000a\u000aSeveral climate/energy partnerships have been initiated across the world, many emerging within the past decade. Some serve as discussion forums, some focus on policy, some have regional or city-level mandates, and some target specific technologies. My colleagues and I reviewed more than 30 initiatives and found that very few had been designed to extend beyond sharing knowledge and some preliminary R&D activities. Even fewer had enlarged functional focus on actual transfer of equipment, joint production, or extensive deployment mandates.Mostly, we have been hanging our hopes on talk shops.\u000a\u000aThree obstacles have impeded partnerships: lack of appropriate financing, (IP) restrictions, and insufficient or underutilised capacity. For existing technologies, unless appropriate financing is available, deployment at scale is difficult. Entrepreneurs need upfront financing to cover capital costs of clean energy technologies, working capital to hold inventories, and funds to pay IP licence fees. Business models, such as rural micro-grids, could be viable but, being small in scale, they often fail to attract the attention of large institutional investors. India's Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme, by scaling up public procurement and distribution of LED bulbs in 100 cities, will slash costs by 60 per cent.\u000a\u000aSecondly, to develop new technologies, innovators need clear market signals. Public policy intervention - whether by setting a carbon price, direct R&D investment, or guaranteeing a minimum price for emerging technologies - is needed to stimulate private investment. The US Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative was designed with this purpose, resulting in steep falls in utility-scale solar prices. Another approach is to develop partnerships wherein contributing firms/research institutions retain their original IP but share returns on new technologies. Global partnerships in agriculture, genetics, particle physics and nuclear fusion have adopted similar approaches of co-development and co-ownership of IP, as do the India-US Joint Clean Energy R&D Centers on solar, energy efficiency and biofuels.\u000a\u000aThirdly, to be inclusive and effective, partnerships should contribute to building capacity in weaker partner countries to ensure that deployment is widespread, not captured by a few, as has occurred in the past. Members need not only have to contribute in hard currency. In-kind contributions of research staff, facilities, or land for demonstration projects could be ways in which the contributions of all members are recognised and duly rewarded.\u000a\u000aThese lessons suggest ways to design two new initiatives, in which India could be a leading partner. The first would be a multi-country partnership on energy access and decentralised energy. Decentralised energy entrepreneurs are combining innovations in technology and business models (India, alone, has 400 firms); Bangladesh has deployed millions of solar home systems; innovative mobile payment mechanisms are in use in East Africa; in Southeast Asia opportunities exist to use agricultural waste in cogeneration systems. There is also extensive experience in developed countries. An could increase access to working capital for far-flung small entrepreneurs, pay for licencing fees, underwrite experiments with business models, and, by aggregating projects,establish links to larger investors. Initially capitalised by public finance, the fund could attract institutional investment through sovereign guaranteed green bonds. By focusing on deployment, the Fund would support skills training in rural communities to build, service and maintain decentralised energy systems.The partnership would also support centres to test and certify products, and create model regulatory codes.\u000a\u000aA second idea is a multi-country partnership on energy storage and grid balancing, necessary to integrate large amounts of renewable energy into the grid, in addition to applications in personal and public transportation and off-grid systems. Research and manufacturing are underway in China, France, Germany, Japan and the United States, among others. India could get 30 per cent electricity generation from non-fossil sources by 2030, an opportunity for India to become a global laboratory for storage R&D, testing and commercialisation.Advance market commitments to procure storage technologies could give the demand fillip needed to drive private R&D investment. Innovative financing, such as top-up instruments or tradable options, could reduce the public finance outlay now or in future. The partnership could support disaggregated market assessments; establish pilots in developing countries; agree on co-ownership of new storage technology licences; identify possible joint ventures across the supply chain;and develop policy frameworks to incorporate these technologies.\u000a\u000aAt the United Nations last month, Prime Minister Modi called for a "global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all." India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution proposed "global collaborative research [on] clean coal\u2026, energy management and storage systems for renewable energy." India also aims to host a global solar alliance, the International Agency for Solar Policy & Application. The proposed partnerships- on access and storage - neatly embed into these ideas, have wide-ranging functions and improved design. If Paris triggered effective climate technology partnerships, it would be a transformative break from the past.

VNew Delhi: Chinese tycoons Liang Wengen and Nan Cunhui plan to pour $5 billion into India\u2019s renewable power sector as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks a major expansion of clean energy in one of the world\u2019s biggest polluters.\u000a\u000aLiang\u2019s Sany Group will install 2,000 megawatts of capacity and generate 1,000 jobs from 2016 to 2020 at a cost of $3 billion, a statement released at a briefing in New Delhi on Thursday showed. Chint Group chairman Nan said at the same event that his company will invest $2 billion in solar power and equipment.\u000a\u000aModi\u2019s goal is 175 gigawatts of green energy capacity by 2022, up from about 37 gigawatts, at an estimated cost of $200 billion\u2014more than the size of Vietnam\u2019s economy. Other billionaires such as SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Masayoshi Son and Foxconn Technology Group\u2019s Terry Gou have also outlined plans for substantial investment in clean power in India.\u000a\u000aThe nation remains reliant on coal, which fires about 60% of its power generation capacity. Asia\u2019s third-largest economy also needs to find the funds to pay for its green ambitions.\u000a\u000aDollar contracts\u000a\u000aWhile Modi is trying initiatives such as dollar-linked solar contracts to cut costs and woo investment, India has yet to allow higher distribution charges so electricity utilities can afford more renewable supplies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere have been billions in commitments made to invest in the Indian renewable sector over the last few years, which the government uses to tout as interest from the private sector,\u201d Raj Prabhu, chief executive officer of Mercom Capital Group, a cleantech communications and research company, said in an e- mailed statement. \u201cHowever, very little of these commitments turn into a real investment.\u201d\u000a\u000aSany is China\u2019s biggest maker of construction machinery. Liang has a net worth of $3.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Chint has total assets of more than $5 billion and 29,000 employees, according to its website. Bloomberg

VAlthough Arctic areas have experienced the most rapid warming to date, climate-related threats to the Amazon basin's biodiversity will eclipse those in other regions by the year 2100, scientists have projected.\u000a\u000a"These results suggest that tropical species will likely be some of the most vulnerable to climate change," said study co-author Joshua Lawler, associate professor of environmental and forest sciences at University of Washington.\u000a\u000aTo map the threat that climate change poses to birds, mammals and amphibians across the Western Hemisphere, the researchers used new high-performance computing methods and comprehensive data on the distribution of thousands of species.\u000a\u000aThey estimated the actual distance and speed it would take for an animal to disperse across the landscape to stay within its climate tolerances and survive in the face of climate change.\u000a\u000aFor example, the Amazon's yellow-banded poison dart frog is projected to have to move several hundreds of kilometres to the southwest, because most of its range will likely become unsuitable for this species to live.\u000a\u000aSeveral other amphibian species in this region showed similar movement patterns.\u000a\u000aThis combination of climate data and biological data showed that although polar regions currently are experiencing the greatest shifts in climate, species in the Amazon basin face the greatest threats because of the narrow range of conditions they can tolerate and the longer distance to cooler habitat that can serve as climate refuges.\u000a\u000a"This study is the first time that scientists have been able to accurately estimate the velocity of climate change for thousands of species over entire continents," lead author Carlos Carroll, ecologist with the Klamath Centre for Conservation Research in Orleans, California, said.\u000a\u000aAs climate shifts over the coming decades, such "velocity of climate change" information can help predict which species are likely to adapt in place to new climatic conditions, disperse and establish in areas with newly suitable climate, or face the prospect of extinction.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

VThe overvaluation of fossil assets by an estimated trillion could trigger another financial crisis. Many institutional investors like pension funds are bound by law to only invest in secure assets.\u000a\u000aFor decades, mature economies have seen their jobs being off-shored to newly industrialising countries. To stop the bleeding, they are working hard to unleash the digital and renewable energy revolutions. The aggressive push to regain competitiveness by digital automation has been widely noted. What is less understood is the logic behind the energy transformation. In manufacturing economies, the cost of energy has long surpassed the cost of labour. Decoupling productivity from the use of energy and resources is therefore a crucial step to regain competitiveness.\u000a\u000aTo understand this dramatic turnaround, one needs to look at a couple of game-changers. First, in many markets, the cost of electricity generation from solar has fallen below that from fossil fuels. Second, new technologies finally make it possible to store intermittent energies like solar and wind. Third, a growing number of governments have started to legislate their gradual exit from the carbon economy.\u000a\u000aNo matter how serious these announcements, they are enough to raise questions about the political viability of the $5.3 trillion in annual subsidies for fossil fuels. Consequently, the Bank of England and the German government recently issued a public warning about the \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d. The overvaluation of fossil assets by an estimated $28 trillion could trigger another financial crisis. Many institutional investors like pension funds are bound by law to only invest in secure assets. Given the sheer amount of capital represented, this could mean that in financial terms, \u201cpeak oil\u201d has already happened.\u000a\u000aIn its ambitious Energiewende, Germany targets to cover 45 per cent of its energy demand from renewables by 2025, and 55-60 per cent by 2035. Major industry players have begun to overhaul their business models. The biggest utilities of Germany and Italy have decided to sell off their entire fleet of conventional power plants. Naturally, there has been a political backlash against energy price hikes. The German model, however, was always based on the disciplinary incentives of hard currency and high wages, catapulting its manufacturing base into the export powerhouse it is today. Shifting the tax burden from labour to energy is seen as the right incentive to accelerate the decoupling of mobility, housing and manufacturing from the use of resources.\u000a\u000aIn the long run, technological innovation and higher efficiency are set to bring down energy costs. In addition to these economic considerations, the political crises in eastern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East fuelled concerns over energy security. Greening the economy is thus seen as the best way to curb geopolitical risks and improve energy security.\u000a\u000aGermany is not the only country striking a green new deal between the needs to mitigate climate change, improve energy security and competitiveness, and create new, green jobs. Together with the disruptive innovations of the digital transformation, all advanced economies hope to unleash the third Industrial Revolution.\u000a\u000aWhat does this mean for India? Many in India hope to finally cash in on the demographic dividend when manufacturing jobs start to leave China. Out-competing Southeast Asia, which just got an additional boost through the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, will not be easy. In the short run, India will enjoy a sweet spot between cheap labour and modest energy and commodity costs. Skyrocketing FDI numbers show investors are betting on an Indian economic miracle.\u000a\u000aIn the long run, India\u2019s comparative advantages are under pressure. In many emerging economies, manufacturing costs have almost reached US levels, shifting investors\u2019 focus to factors like quality, supply chains, shipping times and local governance. Digital automation will further erode the comparative advantage of cheap labour. Consequently, manufacturers are starting to re-shore \u2014 shifting production back to the old industrial centres. If giants like India and China fuel their growth with resources, rising commodity costs might price them out of the market. Stuck in the fossil regime, volatile commodity markets, geopolitical risks and insufficient energy efficiency are bound to become a major liability to sustainable development. This means the window of opportunity for export-led manufacturing growth is closing, turning industrialisation into a gigantic race against time. If India hopes to prevail in this race, it must not miss the bus of green growth.\u000a\u000aThe writer is resident representative of Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in New Delhi and coordinator of the Asia-Europe Economy of Tomorrow project\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VGermany's KfW topped, yet again, the list of development banks financing and energy efficiency in 2014, accounting for a third of the total funding provided. looked at 35 institutions, including the World Bank Group, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation, that provided almost $84 billion of financing between them last year.\u000a\u000aAnother report, from the (OECD) earlier this month, pegged the (public and private) mobilised by the richer nations at $62 billion in 2014, up from $52 billion the preceding year. "The key conclusion is that there is significant progress towards the $100 billion goal," the report said. The promise to ramp up funding from developed countries to the developing ones to $100 billion annually was made in 2009.\u000a\u000aThere is, however, an interesting question that has come up: If aid money is loaned at market rates, is it still aid?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat the developing countries are demanding is fairly obvious. "Developing countries, particularly those trying to address climate adaptation issues, are seeking to have as much as possible of the $100 billion on a fully concessional basis, that is, grants," Josue Tanaka, managing director for energy efficiency and climate change at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, told Bloomberg News. The issue will certainly be discussed at the UN climate conference in Paris later this year.\u000a\u000aIt will be tricky separating commercial finance and concessional finance since there are lenders such as the African Development Bank that provide both, and also offer grants. The Ivory Coast headquartered bank has announced its plans to triple climate financing to $5 billion annually by 2020.\u000a\u000aThere is also the issue of providing funding that is "new and additional". It is not clear if the decision of UK Prime Minister David Cameron to channel almost $9 billion of assistance from the foreign aid budget to its International Climate Fund over the next five years, through March 2021, would qualify as being additional.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, the coal industry is seeking funding from the Green Climate Fund - proposed to channel a part of the promised $100-billion financing to developing countries - for cleaner coal plants, which promise lower emissions per unit of coal burned. The report on specifically excluded financing provided for cleaner coal plants, though Japan and Australia averred that such investments deserve to be included. It looks like very busy days ahead for climate accountants.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the new head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, South Korean economist Hoesung Lee, gave a stark warning: "We are running out of time to take action." Emissions must peak no later than 2030, he said.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAn increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.\u000a\u000aAreas of the continent like the Antarctic peninsula have increased their mass loss in the last decades, says a new NASA study.\u000a\u000aThe research challenges the conclusion of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) 2013 report which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.\u000a\u000aAccording to the analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tonnes of ice a year from 1992 to 2001.\u000a\u000aThe net gain slowed to 82 billion tonnes of ice per year between 2003 and 2008.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,\u201d explained Jay Zwally, glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland.\u000a\u000aThe main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica. \u201cHere, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aBut it might take a few decades for Antarctica\u2019s growth to reverse, according to Zwally.\u000a\u000aThe study analysed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency satellites and by the laser altimeter on NASA\u2019s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat).\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the end of the last Ice Age, the air became warmer and carried more moisture across the continent, doubling the amount of snow dropped on the ice sheet,\u201d Zwally noted.\u000a\u000aThe extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia.\u000a\u000aIt is thickening the ice in east Antarctica and the interior of west Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches per year.\u000a\u000aThis small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 mm per year away,\u201d Zwally said. But this is also bad news.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the 0.27 mm per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for,\u201d he pointed out in the study appeared in the Journal of Glaciology.

According to sources, the Solar Policy is likely to be approved by the Cabinet soon.\u000a\u000aOfficials informed that the government had received several comments and suggestions from various departments and also that consultations with the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) and other stakeholders were on for at least a month.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of the suggestions were indeed valuable and we have made minor changes in the draft policy. Largely, it remains the same,\u201d said a senior official.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe policy has been cleared by the environment department and is currently with the power department.\u000a\u000aOfficials said that the chapter on \u201cvirtual metering\u201d was the most debated and discussed of all. The virtual net metering clause in the draft policy is expected to enable every resident in Delhi with a shared rooftop to produce solar energy.\u000a\u000aIt was something which many comments said was in the purview of net metering regulations laid down by the power regulator, said an official. On this, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) confirmed that it is working on the virtual net metering clause. \u201cWe have had a couple of meetings with government officials regarding the solar policy.\u000a\u000aWe are planning to include virtual net metering into the Net Metering Regulations issued by us in 2014.\u000a\u000aBut, the final outcome will be made public only once the Solar Policy is approved by the Delhi government,\u201d said PD Sudhakar, chairperson, DERC.\u000a\u000aOnce approved, the new solar power policy is first going to target commercial and government buildings.\u000a\u000aThe policy shall mandate deployment of solar plants on all government-owned rooftops in the next five years. It would also require the discoms to meet at least 75 per cent of their solar renewable purchase obligation (RPO) within Delhi.\u000a\u000aThe generation-based incentive for residential consumers installing solar panels on their rooftops is likely to remain as it is in the final report.\u000a\u000aBus stands of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), too, shall generate power as the new policy aims to generate 1,000 MW solar power for the national Capital till 2020.\u000a\u000aIn September, Delhi Dialogue Commission, an advisory body of the AAP government, had presented a draft policy recommending generation of 1,000 MW solar power capacity for the national Capital by 2020.\u000a\u000aOnce approved, the new solar power policy is first going to target commercial and government buildings

VAny plausible game plan for capping the rise of Earth's surface temperature depends on replacing fossil fuels with energy sources that generate little or no carbon pollution.\u000a\u000aThat means renewables, especially solar and wind, both of which face fewer constraints to growth than more established clean energy: a river can be dammed only so many times, and nuclear remains expensive and controversial.\u000a\u000aBut humanity has dithered for so long in the fight against global warming, experts say, that the window of opportunity for decarbonising the fast enough to avoid devastating climate change is barely ajar.\u000a\u000a"The cost and difficulty of mitigating greenhouse gases increases every year, time is of the essence," Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in a special IEA report on energy and climate change released earlier this year.\u000a\u000aThe world's nations -- gathering in Paris in a month to ink the first-ever universal climate pact -- have set a target of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aCross that red line, scientists say, and there will, almost literally, be hell to pay.\u000a\u000aScience also tells us that, if we are to respect the 2 C limit, future greenhouse gas emissions cannot exceed a total "budget" of about 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aCarbon-cutting pledges from nearly 150 nations, unveiled on Friday, put us on track for a 3 C world.\u000a\u000aThis is a vast improvement on doing nothing. But even this unprecedented effort would use up three quarters of that carbon budget by 2030, leaving very little margin for closing the remaining gap.\u000a\u000aThat's where the transition from fossil fuels to renewables comes in.\u000a\u000a"The economics have been shifting on both sides of the equation," said Alden Meyer, a veteran climate specialist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. "The least-cost global strategy is to rapidly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and switch into the clean-energy economy."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn poor countries, this holds out the possibility of skipping past the fossil fuel stage of development, much in the way some regions went from no phones to cell phones.\u000a\u000a"I think India" -- where 300 million people are without electricity -- "is realising that it may be easier and more cost effective for them to provide sustainable energy services to hundreds of millions of villagers through a decentralised renewable-based strategy," said Meyer. "They and other countries are poised to leapfrog the fossil fuel age."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia has invested massively in clean energy, and pledged to install 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022.

VLahore: Asghar Leghari had had enough. The farmer was tired of watching his family fight against the unpredictable weather that threatened their crops in Rahim Yar Khan District, in Pakistan\u2019s South Punjab region.\u000a\u000aHe was also disheartened by the fates of many small-scale farmers around him, whose struggles with weather shifts have ended in poverty. And he was angry at Pakistan\u2019s seeming inability to protect its people against the devastating effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aSo Leghari decided there was only one thing to do: he took the government to court.\u000a\u000aIn August, Leghari, 25, filed a petition with the Lahore high court claiming that the government of Pakistan was violating his fundamental rights by neglecting to tackle the impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aQuoting the objectives of the country\u2019s 2012 National Climate Change Policy, he accused leaders of failing \u201cto ensure water, food and energy security\u2026 in the face of the challenges posed by climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah ordered the formation of a Climate Change Commission to push forward the policies the government promised.\u000a\u000aThat commission, made up of officials from key ministries\u2014including the ministry of climate change and the ministry of water and power\u2014as well as heads of other government departments and international organizations, has now begun meeting.\u000a\u000aClimate change \u201cappears to be the most serious threat facing Pakistan,\u201d the judge said.\u000a\u000a\u2018Public interest\u2019 lawsuit\u000a\u000aLeghari, who is studying law in Lahore, said his family relies on the income it gets from its more than 500-acre sugarcane farm in Rahimyar Khan.\u000a\u000aBut water scarcity and temperature changes in the Punjab region are stressing crops and making it impossible for some farmers to continue to make a living.\u000a\u000aLeghari said he felt it was time to hold the nation\u2019s leaders accountable.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy petition aimed to compel the concerned departments and ministries to take action and consider climate change an important issue before it is too late,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe believes government action on the problem has been negligible, even though the nation has had a climate change policy and framework in place for over three years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe circumstances that merited the filing of this petition do not affect only me, but are endemic,\u201d Leghari said. The case \u201cdoes not deal with an individual grievance, but seeks to address a larger public interest matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aWater shortages\u000a\u000aThe law student said his family farm has struggled in particular with access to water as supplies dry up and rainfall becomes more unpredictable.\u000a\u000aAccording to the ministry of climate change, in 1950, water availability in Pakistan stood at 5,300 cubic metres per person per year. By 2011, that figure had dropped to under 1,000 cubic metres and is still shrinking.\u000a\u000aLeghari\u2019s petition argued that the government is obligated to implement the policies it laid out in 2012, including practical steps needed to adapt to the effects of climate change and to limit the country\u2019s own emissions that contribute to the problem.\u000a\u000aThose include things like promoting crop irrigation practices that waste less water and new crop varieties that require less water, and urging farmers to use biogas and manure digesters to generate green energy and reduce methane emissions.\u000a\u000aLeghari said he isn\u2019t demanding compensation. What he wants from the government, he said, is action on the broader problem.\u000a\u000a\u201cDirect relief would be insufficient in scope to compensate me or other farmers against future grievances,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is an issue that is here to stay if adequate measures are not taken.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Ray of hope\u2019\u000a\u000aIn response to Leghari\u2019s petition, Sajjad Ahmad, joint secretary of the ministry of climate change, told Pakistan\u2019s Dawn newspaper that the government has put policies in place but many have not been implemented.\u000a\u000aLeghari\u2019s advocate in court, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Thomson Reuters Foundation that government departments that might be required to act on climate change\u2014including agriculture and forestry, irrigation, water and power and the Federal Flood Commission\u2014had failed to deliver effective adaptation and mitigation measures.\u000a\u000aThe new commission hopes to begin changing that.\u000a\u000aHameed Naqi, director general of WWP-Pakistan, one member of the commission, said that even if the group manages to implement only the priority actions set out in the 2012 National Climate Policy\u2014most of which are aimed at protecting the nation\u2019s fast-dwindling forests\u2014that would make huge strides toward addressing the country\u2019s climate and environmental problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe judge is pushing the government departments to take action,\u201d he told Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cThe commission is a ray of hope for us.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeghari said he hopes the judge\u2019s order will be the start of a broader public effort to demand action on climate change and push the country to meet the goals it has set for itself.\u000a\u000aThe court has \u201cjump-started the process,\u201d he said. Now, \u201chopefully this will result in positive change for everyone.\u201d Reuters

VNew Delhi: Exhorting the Group of 20 (G-20) nations to shift from a system of carbon credit to \u201cgreen credit\u201d, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the group of economic powerhouses should ensure that finance and technology is available for countries to meet the universal global aspiration for clean energy in their efforts to tackle climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe in India don\u2019t see development and climate change as competing objectives. This is centred on the belief in the unity of humanity and nature. We have ambitious plans for addressing the challenges of climate change,\u201d Modi told G-20 leaders at the working lunch on development and climate change. \u201cWe must meet the target of $100 billion goal per year by 2020. The G-20 countries should increase the share of traffic on public transportation in cities by 30% by 2030. We should shift from carbon credit towards green credit,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aModi said important moves taken by India to tackle change include: aiming to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, cutting subsidies on fossil fuel, a tax on coal and a $3 billion national clean energy fund to promote clean technologies.\u000a\u000aAhead of the global climate change meeting in Paris next month, the prime minister said that with its highly ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), India would remain in step with the world. \u201cWe look forward to a concrete outcome in Paris within the framework of the UN Convention on Climate Change. The framework has an appropriate balance of collective action\u2014Equity and Common\u2014but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe global climate change negotiations at the Conference of Parties, under UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), starts in Paris on 30 November where over 190 countries will negotiate a new global climate regime.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations would be based on INDCs which are voluntary pledges by nations to cut carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aModi said that the G-20 can play an effective role in supporting multilateral goals of increasing research and development to develop affordable renewable energy and stressed that they should ensure that finance and technology is available to meet the universal global aspiration for clean energy. He suggested G-20 countries strive not only to cut the use of fossil fuels but also to change lifestyles.\u000a\u000a\u201cDevelopment in harmony with nature is the goal of my proposal to launch, along with the French President Hollande, an alliance of solar-rich countries at the time of COP-21 (2015 Paris Climate Conference) meeting,\u201d he added. The prime minister highlighted that the G20 is still falling short in its efforts to fulfil its last year\u2019s commitment, \u201cto raise our collective GDP (gross domestic product) by an additional 2% by 2018\u201d.\u000a\u000aHe proposed the G-20 considers building support systems that focus on countries with maximum growth potential, help address specific bottlenecks there and facilitate implementation of country strategies.\u000a\u000a\u201cG-20 must continue to focus on infrastructure, as we did in Brisbane in 2014. Clean energy and environment-friendly infrastructure will address both development and climate change. Bridging the current gap in infrastructure finance in the developing countries should remain our key priority. I\u2019m happy with the focus on small holders and food losses in the G-20 Action Plan on Agriculture,\u201d Modi said.

VIndia has set itself ambitious energy and emissions targets ahead of the Paris climate conference in December. Set against the government\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign to increase manufacturing\u2019s share of the economy and its ambition to bring 24x7 power to all by 2020, the scale of the challenge seems formidable.\u000a\u000aOne of India\u2019s biggest power challenges at present is the state of its grid; in other words, in the distribution set-up. In the coming years, the country will not only need to generate more electricity, but also expand and upgrade the transmission and distribution network to maximise efficiency, reliability and power security. Even though India is among the fastest growing economies in the world, its per capita power consumption is below the global average.\u000a\u000aOn the national level, the integration of the five regional grids into a national grid is a step in the right direction, but their interconnections need to be strengthened. In particular, the transmission infrastructure needs to be developed to facilitate the transfer of large amounts of power often from remote renewable generation sources to rapidly urbanising consumption centres.\u000a\u000aPower plants are increasingly located close to fuel sources, necessitating efficient and reliable transportation to consumers.For a country of India\u2019s size, high- and ultra high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) power transmission is a well suited technology to facilitate such long-distance transmission. The most recent example of this application is the UHVDC \u2018superhighway\u2019 that will carry 6,000 megawatts of electricity over more than 1,700 km from the northeast to Agra. The first phase of this North-East Agra link was energised in September this year.\u000a\u000aHVDC can support the development of large-scale renewables projects, for instance, by allowing solar power where prices are approaching grid parity to be delivered from sunnier parts of the country, or hydro power from the mountainous north to be brought to central parts of the country.\u000a\u000aAnother technology being considered for electrifying remote communities and securing reliable power supplies at critical industrial and remote sites is microgrids. These are modular energy systems located at or near the place where energy is used, that can either be connected to the main power grid or operate as stand-alone grids.\u000a\u000aMicrogrids, often powered by renewable energy, such as a local wind turbine or a small-scale solar farm, could bring reliable electricity supplies to thousands of India\u2019s villages that currently have either no connection or only intermittent power supplies. Widespread deployment of microgrids would also help to decentralise the electricity supply, minimising the impact of outages and making the power system more resilient.\u000a\u000aThe challenges facing India\u2019s energy sector are not to be underestimated. One of the key hurdles facing microgrid deployment, for instance, would be to align these with national policies and programmes to achieve meaningful levels of deployment. It is also imperative that the policies of the Centre and State governments and regulators are in sync. Correspondingly, to create a consumer driven electricity system that is accountable and sustainable, the onus would be to create transparent polices that augment technology adoption. It would also require awareness among end-users or consumers to take microgrid to the next level of wide scale implementation.\u000a\u000aWith about 200 firms already engaged in this field in India, there is strong growth potential. However, these companies often lack a robust revenue model and struggle to attract the necessary capital to expand operations at a faster rate. One solution would be to place microgrids close to mobile towers, which use a lot of energy, thereby establishing a revenue stream for energy companies while also enhancing communications in rural areas.\u000a\u000aMobile-phone technology has given Indians access to communications much faster and at a much lower cost than the roll-out of traditional land-lines could have done. Addressing the larger challenge of bringing electricity \u2014 the life-blood of a modern economy \u2014 to millions while strengthening the grid and lowering emissions demands a similar leap.\u000a\u000aThe writer is President, ABB Power Systems Division

VThis year is turning out to be a milestone year for the world\u2019s future: In September, 192 countries signed the Sustainable Development Goals and on November 30, delegates from 195 countries will converge in Paris for 12 days to hammer out a new global climate accord. There are several cross-cutting issues between the two mega meets, climate change and agriculture being the two big ones.\u000a\u000aIt is a no-brainer why the impact of climate change on agriculture is significant: While all economic activities experience hazards from nature, agriculture is one of the riskiest and climate change is becoming a source of significant additional risks for agriculture and food systems. In fact, in the last 40 years, the impact of climate change on agriculture has been significant and going forward, it will increasingly become tougher.\u000a\u000aA World Bank paper says that each degree Celsius of global warming is projected to lead to an overall yield loss of about 5%. As climate change progresses, it is increasingly likely that current systems will no longer be viable in many locations. This is a serious warning for the world, particularly India, since figures show that the country will have 1.5 billion mouths to feed by 2030.\u000a\u000aThe World Bank paper rightly advises focusing more on risk management in agriculture. There are already examples of such work: The International Rice Research Institute in collaboration with advanced US research labs, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, state agricultural universities, and the ministry of science and technology\u2019s department of biotechnology have spearheaded plant breeding to develop strains of rice that are resistant to effects of climate change, like flash flood, stagnant flooding, salinity, and drought.\u000a\u000aJust think how much farmers in Bundelkhand and Maharashtra today would have benefited if they had access to drought-resistant crops. Investing in climate-resilient agriculture has several downstream effects: It can stem migration, improve rural demand and ensure food security. The farmers, however, not only need access to climate-resistant varieties across agrarian products, but such interventions have to reach them before a natural disaster actually strikes.

VThe Paris climate negotiations are a pivotal moment for global climate policy and carry huge implications for India\u2019s developmental future. The Paris outcome could affect the extent to which India faces dangerous impacts from climate change, which will magnify its development challenges. But it could also impact whether India faces undue global pressure to prematurely cap its emissions or limit its use of fossil fuels for development. Put differently, India faces the challenge of ensuring dual and seemingly contradictory objectives coming out of Paris. It has to make sure that the global community takes serious action against climate change. But it also has to make sure that the mechanisms built at Paris to do so are consistent with principles of equity, allow India to contribute in a manner consistent with its development needs, and do not burden the country prematurely.\u000a\u000aNavroz K. Dubash and Lavanya Rajamani Navroz K. Dubash and Lavanya Rajamani\u000a\u000aThere is a second, more political, objective to be met at Paris. Too often in past negotiations, India has been blamed for climate negotiation deadlocks and painted as a naysayer. While it should not hesitate to defend its interests, it should be careful to not paint itself into a corner. As a highly vulnerable country, with relatively high energy efficiency, low per capita carbon emissions, and a respectable track record of domestic initiatives, India has a good hand. But it has to play it well.\u000a\u000aSubstantive and political objectives\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHow does India achieve both substantive and political objectives coming out of Paris? In brief, India needs to argue for a more, not less, effective agreement in Paris. This must strengthen obligations for all and promote equity. The agreement must also operationalise the oft-cited principle of common, but differentiated, responsibility that tailors the obligations of countries to their responsibilities and capabilities. There are several components to this strategy. First, India needs to join the gathering consensus that the 2015 agreement will take the form of a legally binding treaty. A treaty signals the highest expression of political will, generates accountability and predictability in implementation, and typically survives national political changes. A treaty, however, does not necessarily imply that each country\u2019s carbon-cutting pledge will lend them to enforcement; this depends on the nature of the commitment (procedural or substantive, obligation of effort or result) and the precise language used. Instead, the agreement will commit countries to a process for the future. To address its concerns about safeguarding development options within a legally binding treaty, India can and should negotiate for flexibility, procedural obligations and obligations of effort for itself.\u000a\u000aSecond, the Paris agreement will likely be a hybrid one containing \u2018bottom-up\u2019 elements comprising nationally determined contributions to climate action (mitigation, adaptation, and supportive actions such as finance), and some \u2018top-down\u2019 elements such as how these contributions are reviewed and updated. India needs to argue for a more, not less, effective review and update process. A process that includes regular, five-year updates based on a global aggregate stocktaking of country contributions is in India\u2019s interest as a highly vulnerable country. This stocktaking process should include consideration, albeit in principle, of equity and fairness in the assessment of aggregate progress towards the objective of the agreement \u2014 in particular, its temperature goal. It should also include consideration of the implementation not just of mitigation but also of financial and other support obligations. If India were to put its weight behind such a robust review and update process, it would open the door to a broad range of useful alliances with other vulnerable nations, such as the Small Island States and African countries. A progressive stance on the review, update and stocktaking process, given its crucial relevance to the effectiveness of the Paris agreement, should be a key component of India\u2019s position.\u000a\u000aThird, India needs a complementary but nuanced approach to ensure that such a review, update and stocktaking process maintains pressure on industrialised countries with much higher levels of total cumulative emissions over time, and far higher per capita emissions, and is not used to pressure India. The latter is a real concern \u2014 our review of existing studies suggests that even with India\u2019s ambitious renewable energy targets, coal-fired electricity will provide the majority of our electric power at least through 2030. The principle of common but differentiated responsibility, and the differentiation that flows from it, will need to be thoughtfully articulated and operationalised to ensure that India has the necessary carbon space to develop. Although the template provided by the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol for differentiated responsibility has served India well thus far, given the fundamentally different conceptual architecture of the 2015 agreement and the realpolitik, a more tailored approach to differentiation is now necessary.\u000a\u000aA tailored approach to differentiation\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis tailored approach to differentiation will need to build on the notion of \u2018self-differentiation,\u2019 in which countries implicitly place themselves along a spectrum of actions through their climate pledges. Such an approach can be accomplished through a mix of implicit and explicit signals to guide the self-differentiation process. For example, India could use a key idea at Paris \u2014 the \u2018progression principle\u2019 that each country moves over time to ever more ambitious pledges \u2014 to argue that progression should be based on current starting points which reflect developed and developing countries\u2019 differences. We could also call for the idea of progression to apply not only to mitigation but also to obligations related to support (finance and technology), as this will ensure that developing countries have increasing levels of support as they take on more ambitious efforts. Other aspects may need to be more explicitly addressed. In mitigation, for example, it would be useful if the agreement were to explicitly articulate the notion of developed country leadership, and that developing countries such as India will approach the climate challenge within the context of sustainable development. Such provisions will provide India the necessary reference points to appropriately safeguard development interests. And when located in the context of the progression principle, this helps meet the political objective of sending a signal that India supports an effective climate agreement.\u000a\u000aAt the core of this approach is the idea that India seeks an ambitious and effective Paris agreement, but one founded on every country leveraging up its pledges and actions in a manner that recognises different starting points and responsibilities. The alternative is to play for a weak agreement, one that is unlikely to place pressure on India, but will let developed countries off the hook as well. This leveraging downward is to be avoided; it is likely to expose India to enhanced climate risk, and make us vulnerable to the charge that we are unsupportive of the process.\u000a\u000aImplementing this strategy of leveraging up will be a challenge, requiring going beyond rote recitation of the ideas and text from an earlier era. Instead, it will take detailed and clever textual negotiation using concepts such as progression, and careful alliance building with those who support an effective and equitable climate agreement. India\u2019s climate diplomacy must rise to the challenge of protecting its interests in a manner suited to the emerging political and negotiating context.\u000a\u000a(Navroz K.

VTechnologies that are already available, such as carbon capture and storage, have proved prohibitively expensive.\u000a\u000aA decade or two from now, the world should be able to look back at the UN climate conference in Paris and say with the wistfulness of the ex-lovers in Casablanca: \u201cWe\u2019ll always have Paris.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut will we? There is real anxiety in India, and other poorer countries that rely heavily on coal, that the stance of advanced nations might in one vital respect stand in the way of successfully fighting climate change.\u000a\u000aIn the run-up to the conference, there is a growing call\u2014first articulated clearly at this year\u2019s summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations\u2014to phase out fossil fuels. The US and others have also vowed to vote against fossil fuel energy projects in developing countries when multilateral development banks are voting on them. Meanwhile, the US produces at least 35 per cent more coal than India.\u000a\u000aFor India\u2014a country struggling to provide basic electricity to about 25 per cent of the population, according to conservative estimates\u2014this smacks of a \u201ccarbon imperialism\u201d. And such imperialism on the part of advanced nations could spell disaster for India and other developing countries.\u000a\u000aIn fact, rather than replacing coal, the only way India and other poorer nations can both meet their needs and minimise damage to the environment may be to find effective techniques to \u201cclean and green\u201d coal.\u000a\u000aUnder any plausible scenario, coal will provide about 40-60 per cent of India\u2019s energy until 2030. It will, and should, remain the country\u2019s primary energy source because it is the cheapest fuel available.\u000a\u000aBut India is neither unaware of the social costs of coal nor is it lax in promoting renewables. It has already started taxing carbon, both explicitly and implicitly. The coal tax has quadrupled to R200 ($3) a tonne since 2014. This has resulted in an implicit carbon tax of $2 a tonne of carbon dioxide on domestic coal. This may, of course, still not be enough to cover all the social costs of carbon use.\u000a\u000aThere has also been a substantial indirect tax on carbon. In response to the fall in the oil price, the government has eliminated subsidies on petrol and diesel and increased taxes. India has therefore moved from a negative price\u2014that is, a subsidy\u2014to a positive price on carbon emissions. In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change.\u000a\u000aIt is encouraging, too, that the problem of pollution is becoming part of domestic political discourse. New Delhi is requiring monitoring mechanisms for pollution in a number of cities. The pressure on local governments elsewhere in the country to take account of the domestic social costs of increased carbon-related pollution\u2014health, accidents and congestion\u2014will almost certainly grow.\u000a\u000aIndia is committed to an ambitious renewables programme, ramping up renewables capacity from 35 gigawatts today to 175 gigawatts by 2022. But as Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist, has pointed out, the prices of properly costed renewables are not competitive with coal today, and they are not likely to be any time soon. It is wishful thinking to imagine that renewables can replace coal in the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aSo, although Delhi is committed to curbing climate change and to promoting renewables, making coal clean is vital to the country\u2019s development. However, this cannot be done by India, or anyone else, alone.\u000a\u000aTechnologies that are already available, such as carbon capture and storage, have proved prohibitively expensive. To discover truly effective techniques, the world collectively needs to embark on a programme akin to the Manhattan project that produced the first nuclear bomb.\u000a\u000aThis would require investment from both public and private sectors, in advanced and developing nations, as well as a range of policy instruments. But the rich world\u2019s preoccupation with phasing out fossil fuels creates a risk that the private sector\u2014already lukewarm about investing in cleaning coal\u2014will read the signals and abandon this project altogether.\u000a\u000aIn the past few months I have met senior leaders from the US, the UK, France, Germany, Australia and Japan. All appreciated that the need to clean coal is a significant part of efforts to fight climate change. The time is ripe to create a global green and clean coal coalition. That, rather than unconscionable calls to phase out India\u2019s cheapest form of energy, would best serve the cause of fighting climate change.\u000a\u000aThe writer is the Indian government\u2019s chief economic adviser\u000a\u000a(This article first appeared in The Financial Times on November 26)

VPM Narendra Modi leaves New Delhi to join world leaders in Paris. PM Narendra Modi leaves New Delhi to join world leaders in Paris.\u000a\u000aA smartly done India pavilion at the venue of the climate change conference in Paris was grabbing eyeballs, bringing a smile on faces of negotiators and campaigners who started gathering in the French capital for two weeks of tense negotiations at one of the most keenly-awaited meetings in recent times.\u000a\u000aThe conference formally began in the evening Sunday, a day earlier than the usual Monday start, but only for logistical and procedural discussions. Monday is the big day when close to 150 heads of states and governments, including India\u2019s Narendra Modi, will make three-minute speeches each, offering their political support to the negotiations that are expected to deliver a landmark global agreement on climate change.\u000a\u000aAlso read: Barack Obama to meet PM Modi today\u000a\u000aModi landed in Paris Sunday night after talking to the nation on climate change through his Mann ki Baat radio programme. His role in Paris is not just confined to making the three-minute appeal. Modi will launch the Global Solar Alliance, an effort to bring together tropical countries to promote solar energy, in a separate event for which at least 30 heads of states have signed up to attend, Indian officials said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe entire world is worried about climate change, global warming, and it is being debated and discussed everywhere. This is everyone\u2019s responsibility and also concern,\u201d Modi said in his radio broadcast.\u000a\u000aA book whose preface has been written jointly by him and French President Francois Hollande will also be launched and distributed to all visiting delegates. The book contains excerpts of writings and thoughts of famous Indian and French philosophers on the need to maintain harmony with nature.\u000a\u000aAlso read: Earth is a wilder, warmer place since last climate deal\u000a\u000aModi will formally open the India pavilion which has impressed everyone \u2014 it is the first time India has put up a pavilion at this annual conference to showcase its philosophy and approach towards climate change. A falling water fountain that made patterns of words and built messages like \u2018Just Climate Action\u2019, and \u2018Kochi, first green airport of the world\u2019, chic audio visuals on circular walls that acted as screens, and lots of digital information about India\u2019s climate programme forced every passer-by to stop, acknowledge and appreciate.\u000a\u000aBut the main excitement Sunday was outside the conference venue, not just in Paris but in hundreds of other cities across the world, including Delhi and Bangalore. Coordinated protest marches were organised by several NGOs demanding greater action on climate change and tougher restrictions on the bigger emitters. At one event in Paris outside a railway station, police had to fire teargas shells to disperse the crowd.\u000a\u000aThat was the only ripple caused by law enforcement agencies in Paris which hardly looks a city hosting such a major global event barely three weeks after a terrorist attack that killed over 100 people. There are no barricades to be seen anywhere, no additional security checks and no posse of policemen guarding the streets. In fact, the French government made all public transport in Paris free for everyone, thereby lifting that small restriction of controlled access to railway stations.\u000a\u000aIn this file photo, pools of melted ice form atop Jakobshavn Glacier, near the edge of the vast Greenland ice sheet.

VWorld leaders meet today in Paris, not to discuss terrorism, but to discuss another of our generation\u2019s biggest threat, climate change. It is clear that already, when temperatures have risen by less than 1C, over pre-industrial era, the world is seeing weird and devastating weather events. In India, farmers are hit again and again with unseasonal rain, hail and extreme rain and temperatures, which is crippling their livelihoods, driving them to destitution and even death. Therefore, Paris needs to arrive at an effective and ambitious agreement to reduce emissions and to keep the world below the 2C rise guardrail \u2013 an increase that is seen to be least risky and most attainable today.But we also know that limiting the rise of temperatures also limits the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted in the atmosphere. So, Paris is about an agreement to share the global carbon budget. The fact is that in spite of all the talk and all the rhetoric, the world has still not delinked growth from emissions. This is the really inconvenient truth \u2013 not what former US president Al Gore made famous through his film on climate change.The stakes are high. In Paris, the very terms of the global climate agreement will change. Instead of requiring countries to cut emission based on their contribution to creating the problem, each country can decide how much it will cut. Furthermore, all countries are required to take action, not just the countries, which are responsible for the bulk of emissions in the atmosphere. In this way, the firewall, which differentiated between the developed world responsible for climate change and the countries, which needed right to development, will be removed. In this way, equity and differentiation will be erased.But this is not all. The UN has accepted that the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions INDC ) \u2013 actions submitted by all countries to reduce emissions by 2030 \u2013 will take the world to at least 2.7C rise, if not much more. So, the world must also agree to how it will ratchet up the commitments of all countries to cut emissions further. This is where the real rub lies. How will it share the carbon budget?According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , to keep the world below 2C, with a 66 per cent probability, the budget is some 2,900 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide between 1870 and 2100. The industrialized countries have emitted the bulk of the 1900 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The world is left with 1000 billion tonnes. The aim of the INDC is to surreptitiously appropriate the carbon budget. The US, for instance, has already used up some 21 per cent of the used carbon budget. Between now and 2030, as per its lacklustre INDC, it will take up another 8-10 per cent. In this way the INDC is not just a country\u2019s commitment to reduce emissions, it is its intention to occupy global carbon space. Once this space is taken, it is difficult to vacate.The only way now to operationalize equity is to make sure that all countries are required to take actions to reduce emissions based on the fair share of the carbon budget. But rich industrialized world do not want this discussed.This is why western media has started an orchestrated campaign to paint India, which is asking for a fair share, as the climate villain.But this is why India must set the narrative straight. We are not climate deniers \u2013 we are worst impacted by climate change. We are taking action to reduce emissions. India\u2019s INDC is more ambitious than the US in terms of moving towards non-fossil fuels. The US in 2030, will have only 30 per cent non-fossil in its energy mix, we have committed to 40 per cent. The US even today has more per capita consumption of coal and its switch to natural gas means that it is moving away from renewables. The fact is that natural gas is only marginally cleaner than dirty coal. It keeps the US locked into fossil fuels.So, Paris is not just about an agreement to cut emissions, it is also about how the world will operationalize equity. Otherwise, socialist France will preside over climate apartheid.(The writer is the director general of Centre for Science and Environment)

VPrime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Barack Obama and Chinese premier Xi Jinping are among 150 heads of state gathering in Paris to push negotiators for an ambitious climate deal to be taken up during a UN conference beginning on Monday to tackle global warming.\u000a\u000aAround 175 countries have tabled INDCs, or pledges, to cut their carbon emissions which, if implemented, would limit global warming to 2.7C by the turn of the century. The figure is higher than the UN goal of keeping the temperature rise to within 2C.\u000a\u000aBefore leaving for Paris, Modi urged people around the world through his monthly radio show on Sunday to conserve energy, citing it as a crucial measure to take on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate change, global warming are issues of discussion and concern,\u201d he said in the programme Mann ki Baat. \u201cEnergy conservation is the first solution to stop rising temperature. This is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith their climate action plans for 2030 on the table, negotiators from nearly 200 countries will aim to clinch a futuristic deal that takes the world on a low-carbon growth path.\u000a\u000aRead: All you need to know about Paris talks\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s leading climate negotiator and director general of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Ajay Mathur, said the Paris climate agreement would not only be for the 2020-30 period, but an \u201cevolving\u201d document to provide a climate framework for the future.\u000a\u000aThe Indian team led by environment minister Prakash Javadekar will raise the issue of India\u2019s right to carbon space in a bid to lift around 300 million from poverty and energy deprivation. Sources said Modi is expected to talk about \u201ccarbon budget\u201d and \u201cclimate justice\u201d for the poor in his opening address at the summit.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want an equitable and just climate agreement,\u201d Javadekar told HT, adding that India will not bow to any kind of pressure. \u201cWe have asked the rich nations to walk the talk on their commitments as India is already doing its bit to fight climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aUS lead negotiator Todd Stern said at a news briefing this week his country was looking for a broad and fully participatory agreement, while the European Union said on Sunday they were hoping for a binding pact in Paris. The most-vulnerable least-developed and island nations, on the other hand, seek a treaty for a climate resilient global economy, paving the way for more funds to adapt.\u000a\u000aFollowing this month\u2019s terror attacks, France has deployed around 1,20,000 security personnel to ensure a hassle-free conference that officially ends on December 11. Already, around 1,000 people, considered security risks, have been refused permission to enter the country.\u000a\u000aRead More:\u000a\u000aIndia, US headed for tough negotiations at Paris climate summit\u000a\u000aPM Modi to launch solar alliance at Paris Climate Summit

Reuters Visitors take a selfie at the National Stadium as the choking smog continues to blanket Beijing on Tuesday. All schools in the Chinese capital have been ordered to keep students indoors due to the heavy smog. Reuters\u000a\u000aAs negotiators at the climate change conference in Paris got down to business Tuesday after the exit of world leaders, there were unmistakable signals that India would get singled out over the next two weeks over its plans to expand use of coal to meet its growing energy demands.\u000a\u000aThe formal negotiations began Tuesday morning with countries and negotiating groups making an opening statement in which all of them enunciating their long-held positions. These went along expected lines.\u000a\u000aBut outside the meeting rooms, in informal conversations, press conferences and news articles, there was increasing talk about India\u2019s coal plants and how India was playing spoiler. Such talk has been happening in the climate change circle ever since US Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his disapproval of India\u2019s plans on coal usage in a recent interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is unfortunate and a very inadequate appreciation of India\u2019s energy transition. We are ramping up our renewable energy capacity by seven times and it would be really unfortunate if that effort is not appreciated. Coal would also grow but it is necessary for our development,\u201d Ajay Mathur, one of the key negotiators for India, said.\u000a\u000aMathur said he too foresaw \u201can increasing amount of discomfort\u201d in some quarters about India\u2019s rapid growth of energy sector. He said the India was probably lacking in communicating its efforts properly but \u201cthe numbers are for everyone to see, these are all in the public domain\u201d.\u000a\u000aWhile India has embarked on an ambitious renewable energy pathway, coal is likely to remain its primary source of energy for the next few decades at least. In a recent projection, the government had said it hoped to bring down its dependence on coal for electricity production from the current 61 per cent to 57 per cent by 2031-32. By that year, the contribution of renewable energy \u2014 solar, wind and biogas \u2014 in total electricity generation was projected to grow to 29 per cent from the current 12 per cent.\u000a\u000aBut that has clearly not impressed many people. In one of the press conferences by Climate Action Tracker, a group of NGOs which released a new analysis on emissions from coal plants, each and every question was related to coal plants in India.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is clear that India would be making a very risky investment for sustainable development by going too much further into coal when the alternatives are both cheaper, more cost-effective and have a much lower environmental, health, and agricultural damage on the country,\u201d Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, one of the constituent NGOs, said.\u000a\u000aIn reply to another question Hare acknowledged India\u2019s massive push for renewable energy like solar, wind and biogas but said India\u2019s insistence on using coal was \u201cpolitical argument\u201d and not really a necessity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we see in India are two possibilities. We see a massive, one of the fastest upscaling of renewables that has ever happened on the planet, unfolding in that country. And we see on the other hand a huge lot of talk from the coal industry and (coal) ministry about coal being essential to Indian future. And I think that is a political issue that is playing out. This is an argument that is commonly made in many countries. But on a technical level, there not much basis for that,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier in the day, China, speaking on behalf of the BASIC countries comprising India, South Africa, Brazil and itself, attacked the developed countries for refusing to do enough on climate change and not delivering on their commitments in the Kyoto Protocol, the existing international mechanism on climate change which is sought to be replaced by the ongoing negotiations in 2020.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VPrime Minister Narendra Modi speaks at the launch of the International Solar Alliance in Paris on November 30. (Source: Reuters) Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks at the launch of the International Solar Alliance in Paris on November 30. (Source: Reuters)\u000a\u000aThe Global Solar Alliance, which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Paris on Monday, has been creating quite a buzz. Governments, businesses, NGOs and academics have welcomed the initiative, which is being seen as a major step in the fight against climate change.\u000a\u000aThe Alliance is likely to boost the absorption and deployment of solar power, which has already seen exponential expansion in the last five years \u2014 between 2010 and 2014, the installed capacity of solar energy across the world has grown from 23 GW to about 180 GW. During the same time, price of solar electricity has fallen by about eight times. Even in India, the price of solar electricity is likely to become very competitive in comparison to coal or other sources of energy once the new solar plants being installed now are operational.\u000a\u000aSuch is the excitement around solar energy that at the climate change conference in Lima last year, former US vice-president and Nobel Laureate Al Gore, after making an upbeat presentation on solar technologies, said he had moved from being pessimistic about climate change in 2007 to being highly optimistic now.\u000a\u000aThe Alliance\u000a\u000aIt is an invitation to 121 countries lying between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which get the most solar insolation, to make collaborative efforts to harness solar energy to generate electricity. Most of these countries are in Asia, Africa and South America, and many of them are power deficient.\u000a\u000aBy coming together to install solar power plants, these countries can drive up the demand for solar technologies manifold, in the process forcing down prices even more. Currently, the growth of solar installed capacity has been coming from very few countries.\u000a\u000aAnother objective of the Alliance is to bring standardisation to manufacturing processes and solar technologies. If every country starts using similar products and processes, costs of manufacturing elements of solar technologies can fall substantially.\u000a\u000aThe fall in prices of solar power so far has been propelled mainly by rising demand. Analysts say prices haven\u2019t bottomed out yet.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt can easily go down further. Not just by demand but by technology innovations too. We have not seen enough research and development activities happening in the solar sector as of now, especially in the developing countries for their own use,\u201d said Ajay Mathur, director general of Bureau of Energy Efficiency under the Ministry of Power. Mathur is a key negotiator for India in Paris.\u000a\u000aFacilitating research and development is envisaged as one of the main objectives of the Solar Alliance. A keenly awaited technology breakthrough is in the area of storage systems. There is currently no way to store the electricity being produced by solar systems, because of which the sun is not the most reliable energy source on many days.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is my belief that the Solar Alliance can foster technology development that will ensure a faster scale-up of solar systems in various economies, particularly promoting improvement in storage technologies. It will ensure that the energy access and energy scarcity situation, which India and a number of developing countries are grappling with is addressed on a war footing,\u201d Srinivas Krishnaswamy of Vasudha Foundation, an NGO, said.\u000a\u000aMoney and Infrastructure\u000a\u000aThe Indian government, the prime mover behind the Alliance, has committed itself to providing Rs 400 crore over the next five years to building infrastructure and meeting recurring costs. A secretariat is being set up in New Delhi. Till a building is constructed, the secretariat will function from the Delhi-based National Institute of Solar Energy. India hopes that after five years, the Alliance secretariat would become self-financing.\u000a\u000aStepping stone to more\u000a\u000aThe Solar Alliance model, if it succeeds, can potentially be extended to other forms of renewable energy like wind or biogas. It can, in turn, foster south-south cooperation and bring transformational changes in providing affordable access to energy in poorer countries, and lift living standards.\u000a\u000a\u201c(It is) a truly brightening move. This will undoubtedly encourage global corporates to initiate more bold steps in utilising solar power. This initiative is bound to have a knock-on effect on other forms of renewable energy as well,\u201d Damandeep Singh of CDP India, a business consultancy group, said.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App

VIllustration: C R Sasikumar Illustration: C R Sasikumar\u000a\u000aAll too often, we talk about the costs of climate action: The costs of reducing emissions. The costs of renewable energy. The costs of adapting to rising seas and more extreme weather. But for a country such as India, tackling climate change promises enormous benefits \u2014 for economic growth and productivity, public health and the alleviation of poverty. It is actually a high-carbon economy that costs the most. About one in five premature deaths in India \u2014 perhaps 2 million each year \u2014 is caused by environmental factors. Household air pollution, from burning solid fuels, accounts for half of these.\u000a\u000aOutdoor particulate matter pollution, from burning fossil fuels for power and transport, caused an estimated 6,30,000 premature deaths in India in 2010, and costs the equivalent of 5.5-7.5 per cent of GDP each year. Half the world\u2019s most polluted cities are here in India, including the top four: Delhi, Patna, Gwalior and Raipur. Indeed, ahead of this year\u2019s Diwali festival, authorities called on the inhabitants of Delhi to refrain from the traditional fireworks, given the already alarming levels of air pollution \u2014 but to little avail.\u000a\u000aOur energy choices are also costing us financially. Domestic energy production has not kept pace with growth in demand, which is doubling every 15 years. As a consequence, energy imports have surged. Between 2008 and 2012, we spent an average of 6.4 per cent of GDP importing fuel from overseas. Meanwhile, poor urban planning is also holding our economy back. In less than 25 years, our urban population has almost doubled from 222 million in 1990 to an estimated 410 million. By 2050, it is projected to almost double again, to 800 million. Cities are the economic engine of India, accounting for two-thirds of our GDP and 90 per cent of government revenue. But uncoordinated planning, unreliable infrastructure, chronic congestion and growing travel times are constraining the economic potential of our cities.\u000a\u000aHowever, many of the measures that India is taking to address climate change can help to alleviate or solve these problems. In a national climate action plan, unveiled recently ahead of the Paris climate talks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to reduce the amount of carbon produced for each unit of economic output and increase the share of non-fossil based power generation to 40 per cent of total capacity by 2030.\u000a\u000aThese goals make good sense. By some measures, the cost of generating power from renewable sources in India has fallen by 65 per cent over the last three years. The cost of electricity from new power plants using imported coal is projected to be 30-50 per cent higher than the cost of wind and solar power in 2030. Homegrown renewable\u000a\u000aenergy will help India\u2019s balance of payments, and bring down its exposure to volatile international energy markets.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, distributed, smallscale renewable energy can deliver to rural communities the social and economic benefits of electrification much more quickly than if we rely solely on extending the electric grid. Solar power, potentially coupled with batteries, can improve public health, enable access to education and provide economic opportunities. The financing agenda for renewables is particularly important for India. It will also be the focus of an upcoming UN Environment Programme inquiry. Paris will put a spotlight on this critical issue.\u000a\u000aReducing our reliance on dirty coal-fired power plants will help improve air quality. Providing poor people with clean cookstoves would also help address indoor pollution. These benefits are local, immediate, and substantial: For India, they are estimated to be worth Rs 3,600 per tonne of carbon dioxide reduced. Modi is also pursuing policies to promote smart, urban development. Addressing some of the problems in India\u2019s existing model of urban planning could benefit the economy and the climate. For example, compact, connected and well-coordinated cities are more energy efficient. The World Bank estimates that for every 1,000 km of new bus rapid transit lanes, 1,28,000 new jobs are created and 27,000 premature deaths from pollution and accidents are avoided, all the while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aBusinesses across the country are also realising that there are clear economic wins if they take action on climate. Leading business houses like Godrej, Mahindra, Tata, Aditya Birla Group, as well as IT powerhouses like Infosys and Wipro, are embracing evolving areas for climate action, such as science-based targets for setting ambitious emission reduction goals, or internalising the price on carbon. Public-sector undertakings like the Indian Railways, National Thermal Power Corporation, Gail and Indian Oil are also leading the business charge on national low-carbon development goals.\u000a\u000aMore than 42 of the largest businesses in the country voluntarily participate in the India GHG (greenhouse gas) programme \u2014 an initiative that facilitates measurement and management of GHG emissions. The programme builds India-specific tools and spreads sectoral best practices, driving more profitable, competitive and sustainable companies. And India\u2019s leading association of business organisations, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has established a \u201cgreen bond\u201d working group to examine how the country\u2019s debt markets can enable the financing of smart infrastructure.\u000a\u000aTaking action on climate change and supporting a strong international agreement in Paris offers enormous advantages to India. The government recognises this, and its climate pledges ahead of the Paris talks are to be welcomed. But we can and should go further. Greater ambition on renewable energy and reducing carbon intensity would lead to greater economic benefits for India. It is in our country\u2019s interest to capitalise on the low-carbon economy. It will allow us to enjoy cleaner air in more liveable cities and, hopefully, in a more stable and hospitable climate. In Paris, we should be prepared to show leadership on these issues, because solving them collectively will bring benefits to us at home.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VAs talks on the text of the Paris agreement began on Tuesday, Indian negotiators said they were introducing provisions in it for a technology and financial mechanism that will make it possible to raise low-cost capital and widely deploy renewable technologies.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the focus was on making technological collaboration written into the Paris deal, Ajay Mathur, Director-General, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, told the media.\u000a\u000aThe agreement to be reached in Paris would be in the form of a framework that gives recognition to the voluntary pledges made by countries (described as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). It has to contain provisions on finance and technology, which are central to goals to reduce carbon emissions for developing countries as they grow. The quantum of reductions that countries make and the time frames would be part of allied instruments of the framework.\u000a\u000aCurrently, investors in renewables have to borrow capital at high rates of interest, and this would not enable a quick scale up or reduction in the real cost of power, Mr. Mathur said. Moreover, inducting solar of the order of 100 gigawatts by 2022 would require the creation of balancing technologies to handle the transition and fluctuations. These concerns make it imperative for the Paris agreement to incorporate suitable provisions, Mr. Mathur said.\u000a\u000aIn the government's view, not enough attention is being paid to India's proposed scaling up of generation from renewable sources a staggering seven times, while it was receiving criticism for stating that it would continue to use coal, which represents 160 GW today. Coal is expected to double in capacity. By 2030, India plans to have solar and wind generation touching 200 GW.\u000a\u000aWhat is not realised is that even in 2030, the per capita use of coal in the United States would be an estimated 4 tonnes, as against 1 tonne for India, Mr. Mathur said.\u000a\u000aPursuing the question of responsibility for historical emissions, India has said it favours the stocktaking of carbon on a global scale. As countries cut the greenhouse gases over the years, and a review is done every five or 10 years, nations would get more ambitious with future targets. Even with all voluntary actions, the rise in temperature over the pre-industrial era would be not be able to meet the targeted 2 degrees C.\u000a\u000aAsked about the Indian position on taxing carbon to reflect its true price, as several speakers including French President Francois Hollande suggested on Monday, Mr. Mathur said India was already levying Rs.200 a tonne on coal, and price of transport fuels was high to consumers due to taxation.

VNew Delhi: India needs over $1 trillion from now until 2030 to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, which has already begun to impact on the lives of some 800 million people, or nearly 64% of the country\u2019s population, an academic study said.\u000a\u000aIt said the Indian government spent $91.8 billion on adaptation in 2013-14 alone and this spending is expected to reach $360 billion by 2030.\u000a\u000aThe study by IIM Ahmedabad, IIT Gandhinagar and Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based think-tank working on energy and climate issues, was released on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aIndia as a whole will experience 1-1.5 degrees Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature in the near term from 2016 to 2045, which could have \u201cprofound implications for agriculture and crop production\u201d, the study said.\u000a\u000aThese effects could be further pronounced given the estimated increase in extreme precipitation events, resulting in flooding and significant damage to infrastructure.\u000a\u000aThe study identifies India\u2019s preliminary financial, technology and knowledge gaps in adaptation, as well as capacity building and institutional needs. The study was conducted by Professor Amit Garg (IIM Ahmedabad), Professor Vimal Mishra (IIT Gandhinagar) and Dr. Hem Dholakia (CEEW).\u000a\u000aAdaptation to climate change is a key component at the ongoing Paris climate summit where 196 countries are trying to negotiate a new pact to tackle climate change and keep the rise in global temperature in check\u2014to below 2C of pre-industrial levels\u2014by the end of the century.\u000a\u000aThe study estimated that, \u201cas many as 800 million people living across nearly 450 districts in India are currently experiencing significant increases in annual mean temperature going beyond the 2C warming pathway\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe study said that given these risks of climate change, the total government spending on developing capacity and adaptation in India has grown consistently over the last decade and a huge $91.8 billion was spent in 2013-14 alone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis spending would have to reach $360 billion (in 2005 prices) by 2030,\u201d it added.\u000a\u000aThe loss and damage from extreme events were estimated additionally at $5-6 billion per annum.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe issue of climate change is complex, especially the concept of adaptation. At the national level, the assessment of vulnerability and adaptation needs to be carried out comprehensively. There is an urgent need of enhancing capacity in this area. Moreover, there is also need to comprehensively map the current adaptation measures, gaps and policy actions required in the future,\u201d said Ashok Lavasa, secretary of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, in the foreword of the study.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), which forms the basis for climate negotiations in Paris, reiterates the need for better climate change adaptation by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management.

VIs the >Paris Agreement on climate change a good or bad deal for India? The complex text, produced after four years of tortuous negotiations, does not lend itself to a simple answer. But this is the question that matters for India, and is worth trying to answer.\u000a\u000aEfforts at international cooperation imply that countries must concede something with the intent of obtaining some greater gain. The > premise of the climate agreement is that by agreeing to some checks on national greenhouse gas emissions, and hence energy use patterns, each country benefits from decreased collective exposure to harmful global climate change. Most Indian analyses of the Paris Agreement have focussed on the concession \u2014 >what did India give up? But since India is a country at great risk from climate impacts, a balanced reckoning requires a close look at both sides of the ledger, the loss and the gain.\u000a\u000aSecuring our energy future\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the loss side, >India\u2019s long-standing objective in climate talks is to avoid undue limits on energy options. This is important, as India will require a great deal more energy in the coming decades: for commercial cooking fuels, access to electricity, and power for industries and commerce to provide livelihoods. Although huge, these needs are also uncertain; much depends on how India grows, and on how technology changes. This uncertainty also makes negotiation difficult, as it is hard to know how much to bargain away without causing harm.\u000a\u000aNavroz K. Dubash Navroz K. Dubash\u000a\u000aThe bedrock of India\u2019s approach to ensuring we do not give away our energy future is the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\u201d embedded in the underlying Framework Convention on Climate Change. Without this safeguard, all countries would have been placed on the same footing. India, despite contributing little to the problem and having limited capacity to address it, would have been placed under undue pressure to prematurely limit emissions. Developed countries have long argued for a dilution of this principle, saying that the world has changed since 1990 when the Convention was negotiated \u2014 particularly referring to the rise of China \u2014 and that static lists of developed and developing countries fail to capture this dynamic global context.\u000a\u000aDeveloped-developing distinction\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis deadlock was broken at Paris by acknowledging that the world has indeed changed, yet not so much that these categories are no longer relevant; >developed and developing country categories are retained but made more fluid. Moreover, the Agreement usefully specifies what the principle means in practice for key climate policy areas such as mitigation, adaptation, finance, and transparency provisions. In this respect, India demonstrated some nimbleness at Paris, by shifting from arguing for blanket invocation of the principle to seeking its specific application in key areas.\u000a\u000aFor example, in the core mitigation area, the Agreement states that >developed countries should take the lead with economy-wide emission reduction targets, while developing countries should aspire to do so over time, recognising that they will need to grow their emissions. This allows some countries to cross categories when it deems fit, as China has done by pledging a \u201cpeaking year\u201d for its emissions, while allowing other, like India, to persist with an emissions intensity pledge, which allows emissions to rise. Significantly, it maintains a distinction between developed and developing countries in the provision of climate finance, using the same model of creating a somewhat porous boundary. This distinction retains a key idea for India \u2014 expectations of mitigation actions by developing countries are related to expectations of support from developed countries. Together, retention of categories of countries and their operationalisation in key provisions ensure India\u2019s losses at Paris are limited. An important caveat is that what was a relatively impervious boundary has been made permeable, increasing the risk that India will be pressured to \u2018voluntarily\u2019 cross that boundary sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aOn this aspect, one dissonant note in the negotiations was a successful last-minute effort by a coalition of countries to introduce the >idea of attempting to limit temperature increase to 1.5C instead of 2C. While highly desirable in principle, this increase in \u2018ambition\u2019 was not backed by an increase in action, particularly from the developed countries, increasing the risk that India will be asked to prematurely step up to fill the gap.\u000a\u000a>Also read: Why the EU will continue to press India, China for 5-year review\u000a\u000aNational pledges\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat, then, are the gains for India? Will India gain, and how much, from the Paris Agreement in terms of avoided climate harms? One common line of argument is that the Paris Agreement is relatively toothless, does not bind countries (including India) to actual emission limits, has no mechanisms to enforce actions, and therefore will have little impact. If so, India would have little to gain.\u000a\u000aBut this description entirely misses the point. It rests on a presumption that international agreements drive domestic actions in countries, even against the run of domestic politics. The Paris Agreement is built on a different logic: the motive power for change in energy systems will come from domestic politics in country after country, but the international process can amplify and provide leverage for domestic actors. By this logic, the key elements of the Paris Agreement are the national pledges made before Paris, and the mechanism to encourage those pledges to be ratcheted up over time. This mechanism includes: >a mandatory five-yearly update of all pledges; a technical review process of both climate actions and financial contributions that is meant to ensure countries take their updates seriously; transparency provisions; and a global \u2018stocktake\u2019 on the aggregate effect of these actions. The idea is that the Paris Agreement will set in place mandatory procedures, which then stimulate an iterative process in country after country, ideally stimulating ever greater shifts to low-carbon trajectories.\u000a\u000aThe > first round of pledges submitted before Paris were conservative and have fallen short of what is required, bridging only about a quarter to a third of the necessary gap between emissions pledged and what is required by science. This is why the update and ratchet mechanism is essential; it is designed to stimulate a virtuous cycle of more ambitious pledges, greater investment in low emissions options, and lower costs and barriers to implementation of those options, leading to yet more ambitious pledges. If this works, and it does result in enhanced collective action to limit climate change, then India will be a substantial gainer.\u000a\u000aFor a robust energy policy\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut will this work? The answer rests, as it probably should, in national political processes in all countries, including India, rather than in the international arena. For India, the imperative now is twofold. First, we should make sure the ratchet mechanism sustains pressure on developed countries to ramp up their efforts. This will require and upgrading our ability to analyse other country contributions and actively shaping the fine print of implementing language for the Paris Agreement in the coming years.\u000a\u000aSecond, and perhaps more important, we have to build a robust and ongoing national process to examine our energy and climate future, to replace India\u2019s current ad hoc, disconnected, process of energy planning and policy. This requires a more cogent system of energy information gathering and analysis. It also requires exploring actions that bring synergies across development and climate outcomes (such as energy efficiency and public transport) and those that come with direct costs to the economy. We also need answers to longer-term questions salient to future pledges, such as: how much additional coal energy do we anticipate needing; and, to what extent can we urbanise while limiting high carbon lock-in?\u000a\u000aLooking at both sides of the ledger, India has limited losses because the Agreement preserves space for greater energy use, but with the caveat that we have to better justify our actions through a national process that will also be subject to international scrutiny. Moreover, we can and should use these same mechanisms to hold others to account. On the positive side, there is a plausible, if challenging, pathway to improved global action to limit climate change and its harmful impacts. And, the Paris Agreement offers the not trivial benefit of inducing India to establish a more robust domestic process for energy planning and policy. In my opinion, the balance is, on net, positive.\u000a\u000a(Navroz K. Dubash is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi.)

VIllustration by C R Sasikumar Illustration by C R Sasikumar\u000a\u000aAfter four years of deeply discordant negotiations for the high-stakes Paris Agreement, the French took skilful control and led 196 tense nations past the finish line on Saturday night. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon characterised the Paris Agreement as a \u201cmonumental triumph\u201d, and he was right. While far from perfect, this agreement strikes a remarkably delicate balance between the collective ambition of global efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, differentiation between developed and developing countries, and mobilisation of the financial resources needed for support \u2014 a balance few thought possible even a week ago. India had much to lose and gain from this negotiation, as did the world, and collectively we all came out ahead.\u000a\u000aThe relationship between ambition, differentiation and support was clear from the start \u2014 the greater the overall ambition, the greater the need for differentiation in efforts between developed and developing countries as well as for financial resources to support ambitious efforts. However, there were two seemingly intractable problems standing in the way. First, developed countries, scarred by the Kyoto Protocol that obliged only them to take on absolute emissions reduction targets, were fiercely resistant to another differentiated climate agreement. Second, developed countries, with faltering economies, were reluctant to bankroll global efforts to combat climate change. Developing countries were fundamentally opposed both to giving up the differential treatment that had benefited them thus far and to assuming a share of the financial burden for lowering emissions. Something had to give. Ambition, it was assumed. However, the French were relentless in their pursuit of the most ambitious agreement possible and pressed countries as far as they could on differentiation and finance. This daring strategy, to much astonishment, worked.\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement is ambitious in several respects. It resolves to hold global temperature rise to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts towards a 1.5 degrees C temperature limit. This was a crucial demand of the small island states and least developed countries \u2014 for them, a higher temperature increase poses an existential threat. The world is not currently on a pathway to 1.5 degrees C \u2014 far from it \u2014 and such a pathway would dramatically shrink the remaining carbon space with troubling implications for countries like India. Nevertheless, the aspirational 1.5 degrees C sets an ambitious direction for the climate regime. This ambitious goal is complemented by a binding obligation to submit mitigation contributions every five years and to pursue domestic measures to achieve them. For every five-year cycle, states must put forward contributions more ambitious than their last. To ensure delivery, the agreement puts in place a robust transparency framework. States will provide information on the implementation of their contributions, which is then subject to a technical expert review process. In addition, the agreement envisages a \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d every five years to assess collective progress towards long-term goals. Significantly, the global stocktake will also take into account \u201cequity\u201d \u2014 thus paving the way for conversation on burden-sharing between nations. Although contributions are still nationally determined, the agreement puts in place strong top-down elements that are expected to discipline self-determination and enhance ambition.\u000a\u000aSuch an ambitious framework, applied uniformly, would have acted as a straitjacket for developing countries like India. But the Paris Agreement, in a negotiating coup for India, is firmly grounded in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. The agreement is peppered with references to this principle, particularly the crucial articles that set the long-term temperature goal and frame the implementation of the entire agreement. Further, the agreement recognises that the global temperature goal must be achieved in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and that developed countries should lead in mitigation efforts and continue to provide financial resources to developing countries. It also clearly recognises that enhanced support for developing countries will allow for higher ambition in their actions.\u000a\u000aAs India had long sought, the agreement places contributions on mitigation, adaptation and support on an even keel. Thus the obligation to put forward increasingly ambitious contributions applies not just to mitigation contributions but also to financial contributions by developed countries. The global stocktake, too, will assess progress not just on mitigation contributions but also the finance ones. Tucked away in the introductory text accompanying the Paris Agreement is a decision to set a new collective quantified target from a floor of $100 billion per year from 2025, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. Both on finance and differentiation, developed countries made significant concessions from past positions in the final hours to make a compromise possible, while developing countries like India won several battles along the way.\u000a\u000aMore than a milestone, Paris represents a landmark in the UN climate negotiations. In striking a fine balance between ambition, differentiation and finance, it sets us on track to secure our climatic future, the best way we know how \u2014 based on our common but differentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities and different national circumstances. Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar signalled in his closing speech that the road to climate ambition must be paved with equity. And the historic Paris Agreement ensures that it will be.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

V\u201cIn the last six years,\u201d said Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation, a policy research group, \u201csolar prices have dropped by more than 80 percent, and now cost less than a new coal plant. Wind is down 60 percent, and LED lights more than 90 percent.\u201d With other new technologies near at hand \u201cit becomes clear that a clean future costs no more than a dirty one,\u201d he said. \u201cTexas now has the most wind installed of any U.S. state. Texas!\u201d\u000a\u000aHarvey\u2019s team has built a computer model to see which policies can decarbonize the economy at the lowest price. It lets a user test varying policy options on climate, pollution and the economy. If you pick the right blend, the results will have you grinning. Go online, at www.energypolicy.solutions, and try it for yourself.\u000a\u000aThe point, said Harvey, is that today\u2019s chief executive doesn\u2019t \u201chave to be a hero anymore\u201d to invest in clean power.\u000a\u000aIndeed, Jos Manuel Entrecanales, chairman of Acciona, the giant Spanish renewables company, told me that he used to be sprinting alone in the race to install renewables \u201cwith the wind in my face.\u201d But now he finds the wind is at his back, and some of the biggest oil companies are trying to muscle into the race. That is not an accident, he said, considering that recent deals from Morocco to South Africa to Chile were struck for around 2.8 cents a kilowatt-hour of wind and 4.2 cents a kW-h for solar, making them highly competitive with fossil fuel.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Chile,\u201d said Entrecanales, \u201cthere was [just] an auction which was technology agnostic, so the government was offering big bunches of energy to be supplied over the next 10 years, 20 years, and all the energy awarded was renewable. Not one single megawatt hour of conventional energy was supplied.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, he stressed, leveraging the Paris consensus to get a price on carbon in the big emitting countries is the \u201cHoly Grail,\u201d the thing that tips everything. Because while renewables can win against new fossil fuel plants, old fossil fuel plants built without any pollution control, and with all their capital expense amortized and still enjoying subsidies, can still run very cheaply \u2014 if you don\u2019t count their massive carbon impacts.\u000a\u000aA price on carbon, said Entrecanales, \u201cwould drive technology, it would drive R&D, it would drive investment, it would drive consumer habits.\u201d So Paris was necessary. A price on carbon will make it sufficient.

VIndia at 1.4 tCO2/person in 2010 is one of the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world. India\u2019s emissions were less than one third of the world average of 4.5 tCO2/person, less than one twelfth that of the US. Yet, India is highly vulnerable to climate change, and has a deep interest in an equitable global agreement and took a leading role at the Conference of Parties in Paris.\u000a\u000aTo reduce emissions we can reduce energy use or use renewable sources. Energy efficiency is a major resource. While investments are required, it is economically attractive and pays for itself. Even with the emphasis on efficiency India must increase its energy supply. India\u2019s target to set up 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022 is a huge step forward. For India, the potential of renewables is vast; yet, coal will remain an important part of its energy needs.\u000a\u000aBut the capabilities of renewable energy in addressing the world\u2019s needs are still limited. The non-availability of low-cost finance for renewable energy projects and the absence of a domestic manufacturing base impact the sector\u2019s growth in India. To replace a one KW coal-based plant, which can generate 7,000 units/year, we need to invest in 4 KW of solar capacity as 1 KW of solar can generate only 1,600 units/year. Thus the upfront investment would be 6 to 8 times as large.\u000a\u000aHerein lies the dilemma for India \u2014 investing in renewables means less investments for other sectors like health, education and infrastructure. India has used several instruments to promote renewable power. The Accelerated Depreciation scheme for wind power, for example, provides subsidies to set up wind-generated power plants.\u000a\u000aAnother is reverse bidding for feed-in-tariff for solar energy. This system invites bids from generators to set a price at which they can supply renewable electricity. Another instrument is Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO), which requires a distributor to procure a prescribed fraction of electricity from renewable power either by generating it or by buying it to make up for shortfalls.\u000a\u000aThese instruments promote the growth of renewable energy. India will need to adopt a multi-pronged approach spanning sectors to combat climate change. Energy efficiency is a low hanging fruit and must have the highest priority. For sustainability, initiatives must be in place to make solar technology cost competitive with coal. India\u2019s rain water harvesting programme and watershed development can have positive outcomes for agriculture.\u000a\u000aThe development of cellulosic ethanol \u2014 a biofuel derived from wood, grasses, or the inedible parts of plants \u2014 can increase India\u2019s energy independence. India must mobilise private investment in technologies that support sustainable transport infrastructure to increase usage of public transport and reduce use of petroleum products.\u000a\u000aAnother would be to put in place an effectively calibrated RPO standard that will incentivise the private sector to make investments. What is also necessary is investment in research and knowledge sharing. There must be an institutional set-up for low-carbon or renewable technology with intellectual property rights shared as global public goods. Going forward, global collaboration will be the lynchpin for an effective and fair way to deal with climate change.\u000a\u000aKirit Parikh is chairman, Integrated Research and Action for Development and former member, Planning Commission\u000a\u000aThe views expressed are personal

VWASHINGTON: Citing India's announcement to double its coal production by 2020, an influential US lawmaker today alleged that the Paris agreement on climate change is just a "window dressing" in the absence of mandatory targets for reduction in carbon emissions."The ink on the agreement is barely dry, and India has already indicated it will continue with plans to double coal production by 2020. Developing countries like China and India will continue to need affordable energy as they grow, and no agreement can change that," Congressman David McKinley said.In a statement, McKinley alleged that the Obama administration deliberately shaped the agreement to circumvent Congress because it knows this plan wouldn't stand a chance of approval."The agreement could not be ratified as a treaty, because Congress will not go along with a policy to move away from coal and natural gas and hurt our economy, increase energy prices, and destroy jobs in the process," he said."As the public reads through the Paris climate agreement they will understand that it is simply window dressing."While the aftermath of the agreement has been full of self-congratulatory applause and high-minded rhetoric about saving the planet, the real impact of the agreement is questionable," he said."It appears to be more about President Obama's desire to embellish his legacy than making a tangible difference in global temperatures," the lawmaker said.McKinley said the Secretary of State John Kerry admitted on Sunday that the deal 'doesn't have mandatory targets for reduction and it doesn't have an enforcement, compliance mechanism."It is a feel-good exercise that will have little impact in the real world," he said.Coal will continue to be main source for India's energy needs while utmost care will be taken to protect the environment in meeting over 1.5 billion coal output target by 2020, India's Coal Secretary Anil Swarup has said days after a landmark deal was reached on climate change.Adopted by the 196 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement sets a target of holding the global average rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees.

VEnvironmental sustainability is central to solve our energy challenge. Close to 25% of India\u2019s population is without access to electricity and per-capita electricity consumption, at 917 kWh, is barely one-third of the global average.\u000a\u000aIn India, the regulatory and policy framework needs a substantial change to meet the objectives of energy security and energy independence, with sustainability as the central theme. It must be highlighted that India is seeking a self-commitment in reducing its carbon emission per unit of GDP by 40% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. While a separate policy for the renewable energy sector has been notified to promote investment in the same, an integrated policy planning and regulatory framework with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency is imperative.\u000a\u000aA major step was taken by the government when it decided to consolidate ministries dealing with coal, conventional power and renewable energy under one leadership. This move will help steer an appropriate strategy for optimal utilisation of conventional and renewable fuel sources. It has to be broadened further by bringing the other two government arms dealing with petroleum & natural gas and atomic energy under the common framework. There also needs to be a balanced coordination mechanism among stakeholders in the energy delivery chain, such as institutions related to finance, rural and urban development, state governments, utilities, industries and, of course, the end users.\u000a\u000aSome other renewable-specific regulatory reforms are also needed.\u000a\u000a* Integrated approach for harnessing various renewable energy sources;\u000a\u000a* Long-term outlook on renewable energy with mandatory renewable energy obligation targets;\u000a\u000a* National level regulatory and policy framework for renewable energy sources mitigating inconsistency and disparity in regulatory framework across states;\u000a\u000a* Transmission infrastructure for evacuation of renewable energy generation;\u000a\u000a* Credible payment security mechanisms under power purchase agreements (PPAs);\u000a\u000a* Change in existing utility practices to ensure mandatory absorption of 100% renewable energy generation.\u000a\u000aThe power sector is on the Concurrent List. While the Centre formulates the overarching policies, state-government-owned power utilities have a major role to play in enabling reforms as significant changes are required in the distribution sector, which is controlled by state governments. Once these are on track, growth in other segments of power sector can be revitalised. In fact, there have been attempts to improve their performance, but the lack of political will at the level of states has hindered the reform process. State utilities need to focus on supplying quality power and take a more professional approach towards the sector.\u000a\u000aDistribution utilities have to play a major role in basic operational reforms, which includes reduction in aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, distribution losses and improvement in revenue collection. This will have a positive impact on the value chain of the power sector. Also, these sectors, across countries, have common features in their macro-operating framework, while micro-operating framework varies depending on fuel mix, regulatory & policy framework and consumer sensitivity with respect to affordability and reliability of electricity.\u000a\u000aIn power sector reforms, India has done remarkably well in the generation and transmission segments, and is at par with most mature electricity markets, but distribution segment is lagging far behind. Except for a few urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi, the utilities have monopoly in distribution and retail supply of electricity where there is an urgent need to enhance efficiency either by improving performance or by introducing competition. Against this backdrop, the most important regulatory reform would be to introduce performance-based regulations (PBR) for distribution utilities with ultra-short-term, short-term, medium-term and long-term performance monitoring and benchmark parameters.\u000a\u000aThere are some other areas of learnings, too.\u000a\u000a* To promote non-discriminatory open access and promote competition through independent function of the grid operator;\u000a\u000a* To reflect cost of supply in tariffs;\u000a\u000a* To build a competitive market facilitated by adequate transmission capacity;\u000a\u000a* To endorse diversified power portfolios and focus on other sources of power (conventional and renewable) apart from coal;\u000a\u000a* To develop smart grids and prepaid metering.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental sustainability is central to solve India\u2019s energy challenge in the long run. First, close to 25% of India\u2019s population is without access to electricity, and per-capita electricity consumption of 917 kWh is barely one-third of the global average. A large portion of the population is below 30 years of age and the country aspires to grow between 7-8% over next two decades. India\u2019s GHG emissions are expected reach 5,785 MtCO2e (million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) in 2030, in case of a conservative estimate of 5% GDP growth, compared to a base of 1,767 MtCO2e in 2000. However, total emissions can hit 8,235 MtCO2e if we assume GDP growth rate of 8%. Do we have this kind of carbon budget?\u000a\u000aSecond, more than 92 million Indians do not have access to safe drinking water, and the World Resources Institute rated us as a country with a very high water risk. India uses an average of 4 cubic-metre water to produce 1 MWh of electricity, compared to an average of 2 cubic-metre per MWh and 2.45 cubic-metre per MWh in the US and China, respectively. India can\u2019t afford to utilise water at the same rate if it wants to provide energy access to every citizen.\u000a\u000aCurrently, coal contributes to more than 60% of India\u2019s electricity generation capacity. Many of these plants use inefficient sub-critical technology and burn domestic coal, which has a very high ash content. These plants produce less electricity with each tonne of coal and generate more waste. Environmental impact of such plants gets further aggravated because of merit order dispatch instruction from Discom/grid operator, wherein the plant with the lowest cost of production gets the chance to feed the grid first. Since investments in environmentally friendly technology add to operating costs, plants that invest in such technologies end up losing against plants that don\u2019t.\u000a\u000aHence, a policy of purely looking at economic costs and ignoring environmental costs needs to be revisited. The government\u2019s move to increase cess on coal from R100 to R200 per tonne and its plan to build supercritical plants by decommissioning old plants is a positive signal.\u000a\u000aChoosing the right fuel mix without affecting affordability of electricity is important. The government\u2019s plan to scale up renewables from the current 36 GW to 170 GW by 2020 is a major step towards this. In fact, 100 GW out of this 170 GW will be from solar. The deployment of this size of grid connected and off-grid solar applications will not only help India avoid 165 MtCO2e annually, but will also help migrate from a centralised generation model to a distribution generation model, ultimately reducing transmission bottlenecks. The Solar Park Policy, Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects and proposed reforms in Electricity Act 2003 to promote renewable energy and smart grid are expected to improve environmental footprint of the power sector and access to electricity without compromising on affordability.\u000a\u000aThe author is managing director, CLP India

VNotwithstanding the bonhomie between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Barack Obama post COP21 in Paris, the fineprint in the much-touted agreement has very little legally binding for the parties to adhere. All that countries are expected to do is to put out their planned emission reduction targets to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change every five years. There is neither an obligation to set ambitious goals nor do they have to achieve them. Article 28 gives countries an exit clause to get out of the agreement by giving a written notification; any party that withdraws from the convention shall be deemed having withdrawn from this COP21 agreement. Because there are no penalties for non-compliance, there is very little incentive for any party to depart from the convention in the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aAll international agreements need to be ratified by each country\u2019s legislature, and there is no guarantee that local and domestic politics will not kick in and many of them may not ratify them at all. If not ratified by the member\u2019s legislature, the country executives cannot do much other than just simply talk platitudes on international fora for the sake of face-saving. One has to hope against hope for the sake of posterity, and all countries will behave responsibly to save the planet for future generations.\u000a\u000aIt is widely accepted that a 2 degree rise in temperature is unachievable without aggressively cutting down on carbon emission by the end of this century. Aspiration is now set at a 1.5 degree rise in temperature, largely at the behest small island nations who stand threatened with their disappearance due to rising sea levels, and this had no effect on the final agreement in Paris. Sea levels have been raising by one, two, or three millimeters a year depending on whose data you believe. The vulnerability of coastal regions around the world will no doubt steadily increase. Floods, hurricanes and typhoons and excessive rain will continue from time to time as it happened in Chennai just recently. Countries will have to get ready to alleviate the sufferings and losses on their own right now and in the near future. Rich countries will not help, no matter what. This is where India needs to wake up for drafting a national mission for coping with climate change on its own now and even find resources to tackle it.\u000a\u000aThe UK seems to be the only country whose committee on climate change that sets five-yearly carbon budgets has advised that more than half of new cars would have to be powered by electricity within 15 years, and by 2030s, almost all electricity would have to come from low-carbon sources, such as wind, solar, biomass and nuclear. If electric cars have to have any impact, the non-carbon or low-carbon sources of electricity have to come within 25 years. It is also becoming clear that solar and wind energy do little to reduce emissions when there is a fair mix of sources generating power. This should lead to the obvious choice of new technology and nuclear power. Nuclear power is another contentious source for the environmental lobby in India, and although India is still going ahead to establish more nuclear power plants, the going will not be easy. For India to successfully establish nuclear power plants as planned and as is necessary, it becomes imperative for all Indian political parties to agree to this one point common agenda for the nation. However, by looking at the state of political affairs of domestic politics at the moment, it will remain a dream. India will have to engage the environmental lobby with scientific and technologically reasoned arguments to bring them on board. Consensus on new research and more nuclear power is good a news for all, but needs lots of convincing to do. This move augurs well as it has the potential to actually move away from fossil fuels. To the extent all these developments are not convincing enough for climate alarmists, anything that provides a secure and affordable energy future must bear good news.\u000a\u000aDuring COP21, the price of Europe\u2019s carbon fell to just over \u20ac8, and is not expected to rise significantly any time soon. Energy company share prices took a dive more because of fall in crude oil prices than anything that happened in Paris, but have picked up slightly in recent days. Expectations that the signatories will come up with concrete actions on COP21 agreement should meet lots of disappointment. On balance, we may see a shift to nuclear and R&D on new energy generation, protection of vulnerable communities and energy savings and storage. India, like all other countries, must choose a pragmatic and yet environmentally responsible path to energy development. Any euphoria that COP21 will trigger the end of fossil fuels, will be like Mark Twain\u2019s eulogy!\u000a\u000aShanthu Shantharam is an adjunct professor of biotechnology at the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore.

VBEIJING | Dec 30: China will raise the renewable energy surcharge on coal-fired power by more than a quarter for non-residential and non-agricultural users from the beginning of next year, the country's state planning commission said on Wednesday.The surcharge, which is used to support renewable power generation, will rise 0.004 yuan per kilowatt-hour, to 0.019 yuan from 0.015 yuan, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement on its website.The charge will be assessed mainly against industrial users such as aluminium smelters and steel mills. Heavy industry consumes roughly 60 percent of China's electricity.China, the world's largest energy consumer, is trying to boost renewable power and cut coal consumption as it fights chronic smog problems.The head of the country's National Energy Administration said on Tuesday that nearly a third of the 5.7 trillion kwh of electricity China is expected to consume in 2016 will come from renewables, with more than 20 gigawatts of wind and 15 GWs of photovoltaic solar capacity being added next year.Last week, regulators cut the prices power generators get from distributors for wind, solar and thermal power, due to declining costs.

VIn the annals of world history, 2015 might just go down as the year nations decided collective responsibility was going to yield little, and that it was time for every nation to do its own bit for global progress. You could look at it as the year developed nations got weary of the \u201crich man\u2019s burden\u201d, of waiting for developing and poor nations to catch up, aided by development financing from them. Or you could look at it as the year some developing nations came into their own and assumed new roles as global leaders or\u2014faced with contexts that demanded this\u2014decided to go along.\u000a\u000aAt the Paris climate change summit, rich nations like the US, Canada and Australia shook off the yoke of historical emissions or of financing climate-change action in developing countries\u2014in return for having eaten up all their carbon space\u2014and ensured developing countries like China and India had to share the burden of cutting emissions.\u000a\u000aThis was unfair, but India went along since, it was obvious, protesting wasn\u2019t going to do any good, save for better press back home. And, at the Nairobi WTO meet, despite India\u2019s protests, the US and the EU\u2014with support from Brazil\u2014decided to try and junk the Doha Development Agenda that sought to extract greater concessions from them for developing and undeveloped countries; in any case, with the Trans Pacific Partnership and other such pacts being worked on, plurilateral seems to be the preferred way over multilateral. And though the world as a whole endorsed the Sustainable Development Goals\u2014formally adopted by the UN in September 2015\u2014at the third international conference on Financing for Development in July 2015 at Addis Ababa, OECD figures show aid for least developed countries (LDCs) shrank by 16% in 2014 over 2013. Given that overall aid had fallen only by 0.5%, this suggests rich nations are more interested in funding the rise of developing or middle-income nations with immense market and talent potential.\u000a\u000aThough this will hurt many underdeveloped countries, from India\u2019s point of view, this is not necessarily a bad thing\u2014but it will call for a new approach. As this newspaper has pointed out before, the very farm subsidies the rich are objecting to at the WTO are the ones holding back Indian agriculture; indeed, they can be refashioned and, while being kept at the same levels, can be made WTO-compatible, improving the lot of Indian farmers. Having to finance climate change action on India\u2019s own, is going to cost more than what India can afford, but Indian policies of subsidising fuel for decades has only contributed to the problem; not charging most customers the right price for electricity, in turn, ensured energy conservation never took root in the country and, along with free water, ruined vast tracks of land in Haryana and Punjab. If the lesson from Paris gets Indian policymakers off their moral pedestal, and gets them to work on practical policy solutions, that\u2019s a good start to the new year.

VA new year gives us an opportunity to learn from past lessons. Last year, two events made Paris appear on front-page headlines: the terror attacks and the climate deal. Could the Paris agreement be an answer to terrorism as we know it today? Aren\u2019t climate change and terrorism manifestations of the same world process, even though their interconnections might be complicated?\u000a\u000aA 2014 U.S. Department of Defense report pointed to climate change being one of the major threats to the country\u2019s national security. In November, when Democratic presidential candidate > Bernie Sanders referred to the occurrence of drought in Syria as a push factor for terrorism in that country, most people had rubbished it as an overstretched argument, but retired U.S. Rear Admiral and meteorologist David W. Titley made the same point. The U.S. government reports note how climate change has the potential to create instability and poverty in countries it affects the most, leading to discontent that pushes people to take up arms.\u000a\u000aBut what voices in the U.S. fail to acknowledge is how both climate change and terror are consequences of the plundering of fossil fuels. The complicity of powerful nations such as the U.S. in creating a situation in which both terrorism and climate change have managed to thrive has not been emphasised by the mainstream discourse.\u000a\u000aGathering evidence\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Nigerian energy activist, Ken Henshaw, while deposing against the U.S.-based international oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, at the >People\u2019s Climate Summit on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, drew linkages between oil extraction activities around the Niger delta and the rise of extremist groups such as Boko Haram. \u201cNigeria is now called a terrorist country due to >Boko Haram insurgency,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of the insurgency exists in the region bordering Lake Chad. In the last ten years, the lake has shrunk 20 times its original size. Livestock cannot breed anymore in the lands around the lake... People have become destitute, [have] joined criminal gangs... insurgency and fundamentalism thrive, as it has become easier to recruit people.\u201d He said that linking climate change to terror is often viewed as an exaggeration, but failing to see the connections between the two would leave us blind to one of the most obvious existential crises in the world.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cresource curse\u201d phenomenon is very much at work in countries such as Nigeria, where the wealth of natural resources has not empowered the local communities, but has fuelled social conflict instead. Conflict brews among agents of world powers that buy oil, the ruling elites who profit from selling it, and the local population that struggles to maintain control over these resources. This has created an ideal condition for terrorism to thrive. Let\u2019s look at Afghanistan or Iraq. Though terrorist organisations such as the al-Qaeda trace their origins back to the Cold War days, what has exacerbated tensions in the country of its origin today is the struggle over controlling natural resources. The Iraq invasion too was primarily motivated by the U.S.\u2019s own greed for oil. The works of leading intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky and Mahmood Mamdani have exposed how the U.S. \u201cwar on terror\u201d is essentially a war for controlling oil resources. While Professor Chomsky\u2019s work has focussed on the U.S.\u2019s actions in Arab nations, Prof. Mamdani has written about the conflict in Darfur, Africa. In his 2003 essay \u2018Wars of Terror\u2019, Prof. Chomsky recalls how former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff discussed the \u201ccampaign of hatred against us [the U.S.]\u201d in the Arab world, \u201cnot by the governments but by the people\u201d. The basic reason is the recognition that the U.S. supports corrupt and brutal governments and is \u201copposing political or economic progress\u201d in order \u201cto protect its interest in Near East oil\u201d, Prof. Chomsky writes. Today, China too has joined this race to plunder, taking major initiatives to develop the Amu Darya basin in Afghanistan, to be able to drill oil from the region. But such exploitation, without addressing the problems of corruption and the lack of government accountability, has directly aided the cause of terror.\u000a\u000aAnother concern is how revenues from oil are helping to fund terror, as is the case of the Syrian oil fields helping fund the IS. And though the U.S. recently surpassed Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s largest producer of oil, it continues to depend on oil-rich countries for augmenting its fuel supplies. Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq figure in the top five countries from where the U.S. imports most of its oil. The oil dependency of the world powers is, thus, not only brewing trouble in countries from where the fuel is being extracted, but also making them vulnerable to attack from militant groups. It is this dependency that is also keeping the U.S. from acting decisively against the Saudi government, despite suspicion since the 9/11 days that the country is funding terrorist groups. Realising this, world powers are now switching to alternative sources of fuel such as shale gas, though environmental groups are resisting it, as it involves fracking.\u000a\u000aPact and context\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement has to be, therefore, situated in this broader geopolitical context. It was hardly surprising that in the lead-up to the final day of the UN climate summit, Saudi Arabia, the largest oil supplier in the world until recently, was the one country that opposed the climate deal, as its economic interests were at stake. But it finally budged, as it found itself increasingly sidelined at the negotiating table. Clauses on human rights were dropped from the operative portions of the agreement text, in keeping with Saudi Arabia\u2019s demands, in order to achieve consensus over the agreement. The >Paris Agreement is thus nothing but a diplomatic victory for world powers, as they can now mobilise the deal to work towards alternative pathways to energy production. This will help reduce oil dependency in their economies, and also help devise methods to drive down the profitability of oil, which could dry up funding for terror as well. There remain fears that much like the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Paris agreement too could suffer from a lack of implementation from powerful nations. However, with world powers now compelled to act out of self-interest to keep terror at bay, one hopes things would be different this time. The lesson from Paris 2015 is this: until world powers stop digging black gold from Iraq, Africa and Saudi Arabia, the webs of violence, terror and climate change will continue to keep us trapped in the times to come.\u000a\u000a(Email: vidya.v@thehindu.co.in.

VThe year 2015 has come to an end. It was full of events that are interconnected and foretell our future in a way that should enormously worry us. And, hopefully, get us all to rise to the challenge.\u000a\u000aIn December, the talks ended with an agreement far from ambitious and very far from being equitable. It has left the world even more vulnerable and the poor even more deprived of basic human development.\u000a\u000aThen there was the anomaly. Usually dry and desperately water-scarce, the city sank under water. What a way for citizens of this and every other megacity to realise what an increasingly climate-risky world we are all living in. What a way to understand that. If we keep up such mismanagement, extreme weather events are going to make us all go under.\u000a\u000aThen my city of choked and spluttered, running out of clean air to breathe. It has learnt the really hard way that it must find leapfrog options, combining both technology and lifestyle choices of mobility patterns, if it wants to live on something as basic as breathable air.\u000a\u000aClearly, 2015 has brought home tough messages. One, environmental issues cannot be ignored if we want to secure life and health. Two, development has to take a different path, for we must - starting now - mitigate its visibly adverse impacts. Three, since we live in a planet where warming is now unleashed and unbridled, what we do must be done at an extraordinary speed. Indeed, 2015 has done all of us a huge favour: it has been a tea-leaf reading of our future. Dire warnings we must heed. But are we?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLet's take the Agreement as a symptom. The world today is hurtling towards two catastrophes, one caused by our need for economic growth, and the other by unparalleled and gluttonous consumption that impels emissions into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gas emissions, primarily emitted because we need energy, contain portends of a future being placed at extreme risk. We already see how weather variation - whether linked to or not - has jeopardised the livelihoods of millions of farmers in India in 2015. Farmers are now driven to ultimate desperation - suicide. These failures, a combination of poor policies, are now exacerbated by untimely, weird weather, and have caused so much human pain.\u000a\u000aIn this manner, the development dividend, which is so hard to secure in the first place, is being lost. And there is much more to come. Paris, with its weak and unambitious text, has failed us abjectly. The already-rich and the becoming-rich have signalled they don't want to compromise on their growth, or consumption, in the interests of the rest.\u000a\u000aAnother catastrophe awaits us - living in a more inequitable, insecure, and intolerant world. Let's be clear. The Agreement tells us, more than ever, that the rich world has bubble-wrapped itself, and believes that nobody can prick it or burst through. To be secure in the bubble, conversation is restricted to only what is more convenient. In this age of internet-enabled information, ironically, the world is actually reading and being sensitive to less, not more. The circles of information have shrunk to what is most agreeable to listen to. It is no surprise, then, that in negotiations - as in trade talks or international relations - there is one dominant discourse.\u000a\u000aThe most powerful nations would like to believe that there is nobody on the other side. As I wrote from Paris, there was no longer another side. So, there is no respect for another's position. It is believed the other side is either a terrorist, a communist or is just corrupt and incompetent. There is a fatal refusal to fathom, or approach, opinions or realities that are different.\u000a\u000aIn all this, there is growing inequality in the world. No amount of growth and economic prosperity is enough any more, because aspiration is the new God. This means anybody who is poor is marginalised simply because they have just not made the grade. There is no longer space for such "failure" in our brave, newer, world. It is about the survival of the fittest, in a way that would have made Darwin insane.\u000a\u000aIt is no surprise that we, in India, are mirroring this grave, new world. In the last year, the very real plight of the poor, distressed, flooded, drought-stricken and famished was banished from our television screens and newspaper articles. Our world is being cleansed. If we do not know they exist, we do not need to worry about their present or future. We can think about a way of life that benefits us and us solely. This is the true emerging face of intolerance in an intolerably unequal world.\u000a\u000aThis does not make for a secure future. No. It makes for a bloody war. But that is what we have to change, now and forever. I haven't lost hope. Please don't as well. Happy 2016.

VThe world may have been jolted out of its inertia to get its act together and tackle climate change , but global temperatures are not holding still. So the heavy woollens languishing in the closet may not be the worst thing that can happen. The unbearable summer could get hotter, with little respite. While 2015 has been recorded as the hottest year, meteorologists say 2016 will be warmer.Days after 195 countries at the UNsponsored climate meet in Paris agreed to restrict global temperature rise to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d above pre-industrial levels \u2013 and to try and keep it within 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 the UK Met Office released its forecast for 2016. Based on computer models and statistical methods, the UK Met Office expects that global average temperatures in 2016 would be 1.1 degrees Celsius above 1850-1899 averages, referred to as the pre-industrial levels. An unusually warm January, it would seem, is only the beginning.It\u2019s \u201cbad news for the planet ,\u201d says Michel Jarraud, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organisation, the UN weather agency.The five-year period from 2011 to 2015 period has been the hottest on record, with average global temperatures last year breaching the \u201csymbolic milestone\u201d of 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era. Scientists attribute it to a combination of human-induced climate change and the impact of a naturally occurring weather phenomenon known as El Nio El Nio is the warming of the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean in the equatorial region that causes extreme weather conditions across the globe such as scorching heat, droughts, and floods. On the Indian subcontinent, El Nio adversely impacts monsoon rains.The current El Nino event has been among the strongest in the recent past. In India, scientists are attributing the higher-thanaverage temperatures across the country, barring the northern reaches including Jammu and Kashmir and some surrounding areas, to El Nio. Average temperatures have been 4 to 5 degrees above normal across the country.Meteorologists suggest this current phase is likely to stretch till early summer this year. However, according to the Indian Meteorological Department, the current El Nio event is unlikely to adversely affect the monsoons this year, though it could delay its onset. Scientists have observed that the monsoon rainfall is usually normal or above normal following strong El Nino years.\u201cThe year whose annual mean temperature is likely to be most strongly influenced by the current El Nio is 2016 rather than 2015,\u201d the WMO said in a statement.Scientists stress that the long-term warming of the planet on account of climate change-induced by human activities is primarily responsible for the rising temperatures. The WMO points to the records \u2013 \u201cthe world\u2019s 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1998, with eight of them being since 2005.\u201dJarraud is of the view that El Nio may be responsible for 16 to 20% of the temperature increase. The UN weather boss says that longer-term averages show temperature increases regardless of either the warming El Nio phenomenon or its cooling counterpart La Nia.The cause for concern is not misplaced. In March last year, the average concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the most long-lasting of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases, breached the significant milestone of 400 parts per million\u2014the highest recorded since the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii began recording these levels in 1958. From gas bubbles trapped in ice cores, scientists ascertain that the last time the atmosphere had such a high intensity of carbon dioxide was some 800,000 years ago.The projections of a warmer 2016 also take into account indications that another natural weather pattern known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is set to reverse its current \u2018warm phase.\u2019 \u201cThe current warm phase is now 20 years long and historical precedent suggests a return to relatively cool conditions could occur within a few years,\u201d according to the forecast report by the UK Met Office titled \u201cBig Changes Underway in the Climate System?\u201d\u201cOn longer timescales, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has been negative in recent years and this has been linked to a slowing of the rate of global warming,\u201d the UK Met Office report states. Scientists have attributed a slowdown in the rate of global warming in recent years to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, when the ocean absorbs more of the rising temperatures, reducing its impact. They say that changes in the north Pacific suggest that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation may now be entering its \u201ccool\u201d phase and this could push up temperatures.However, because understanding of what drives this natural phenomenon is limited and scientists say its predictability appears to be low, it is difficult to make a definitive statement on its impact as yet.

VUnited Nations: French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal has made the case for higher carbon pricing to promote green technology at a UN gathering of investors. \u201cWe need a carbon price, to give companies the ability to manage the long term cost (of global warming) and give them an incentive to invest,\u201d Royal told the meeting attended by climate crusader Al Gore and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aThe idea of a setting a price for the cost of carbon is to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit by making them pay the bill and focus on the need to develop and invest in green technology. Royal said that while a single carbon pricing would not be achievable, there should be a \u201cprice window\u201d between an agreed bottom figure and a higher price.\u000a\u000aIn Europe, the current price of 8 euros per tonne was too low, she said, adding that 15 euros should be the minimum. \u201cThe challenge is to drive up the price per tonne of CO2, which is currently too low at 8 euros per tonne,\u201d she said. France has set a carbon price of 22 euros per ton, which will increase gradually to 100 euros in 2030. Royal said the drop in oil prices could provide a boost to companies who may choose to direct saving from the lower prices toward their transition to cleaner technologies.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith lower oil prices, we are at the perfect moment to introduce a carbon price. It will be more readily accepted,\u201d she argued. Some 60 countries and regions are paying for carbon emissions through taxes or carbon markets, with China preparing to create a domestic carbon market next year.

VNow that the >Paris Conference of the Parties (COP) meet is long over, countries need to concentrate on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which need to peak soon and go to zero by mid-century if there is to be a chance of preventing average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the level of pre-industrial times.\u000a\u000aThis is especially a >major challenge for the least developed countries and developing countries, as they need to provide an improved quality of life to millions of poor while reducing emissions and shifting to a new model of growth that is a low-carbon pathway. Many countries, including India, have a stated expectation that the country\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) targets >can be met only if there is technological and financial support. Technology transfer may include one or more of the following kinds of processes: a transfer of manufacturing methods, skills, knowledge, supporting finance, and facilitation through institutional arrangements that enable such transfers. Technology transfer has been considered to be critical from the beginning of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and is part of the Convention under Article 4.5.\u000a\u000aAccess to technologies\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInnovation and transfer of technologies are essential if we want rapid shifts to renewable energy systems worldwide. For example, commercially available crystalline silicon solar panels are on average about 15 per cent efficient. However, higher levels of efficiency (up to 45 per cent) have been demonstrated at laboratory scale in the U.S. and Europe. These are not yet commercially available. If India and other developing countries had access to these technologies, they could potentially leapfrog to an advanced stage of renewables, using less land area than currently needed. This does not mean disregarding intellectual property rights (IPR). But support for licensing fees or some such arrangement through financing could allow developing countries to not have to reinvent technologies that the world already has access to. Similarly, hybrid (petrol and electric) vehicles have been available in the U.S. for over a decade now, but are still not in the Indian market, even though they could enable a doubling of efficiency and vastly lower tailpipe emissions at a reasonable cost. In many States, the transport departments hesitate to purchase electric buses because of the prohibitive cost, mainly because of the battery cost.\u000a\u000aExperience in innovation and technology has taught us that along with research and the technology itself, we need the right enabling environment that supports diffusion and uptake of technologies, markets, and supporting regulations and policies. For instance, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency gave meticulous attention to the dissemination of compact fluorescent lamps. It undertook a series of measures to enhance penetration, including large-scale procurement by the government, to ensure markets to manufacturers and, as a result, improved system-wide efficiencies. Similarly, novel business models undertaken by the government to promote Light Emitting Diode (LED) bulbs have resulted in a rapid decline of prices from Rs. 310 to Rs. 69 per bulb.\u000a\u000a>Also read: Plan for Paris: looking beyond emission cuts\u000a\u000aEvery country has technology requirements that are quite specific to its priorities, opportunities and socio-economic circumstances. In the energy sector, India\u2019s needs include highly efficient renewables, better storage technologies, smart grids, clean public transport, efficient para-transit modes such as autorickshaws, and improved efficiencies in micro, small and medium industries which employ large numbers of people. India also needs technologies for adaptation that are suitable to local impacts and conditions, since the effects of warming will be severe in the region. This combination of needs and challenges in different places across countries and ecosystems means that new climate technologies need special attention so that they can be readily adapted for local needs and deployed easily with a reasonable profit; they also need to be affordable to the most needy people.\u000a\u000aThe Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) and the Technology Executive Committee were set up under the Technology Mechanism in COP-16 in 2010. These were meant to facilitate technology transfer by providing information and technical assistance and fostering collaboration among experts through their network. There has been concern about the level of support for the CTCN and its activities, but its establishment has at least placed the issue of technology transfer under the UNFCCC. Various countries jointly launched Mission Innovation before the Paris COP in order to accelerate innovation in the energy sector. This will increase public investments, provide private investor support, increase transparency, and support implementation. Still, the mission\u2019s goals are meant to promote innovation only in the medium to long term, and deliverables from investments in new technology development will, in any case, yield results slowly, over decades probably.\u000a\u000aGiven the short timeline over which the world needs to shift to zero emissions, these processes are too slow. In order to peak GHG emissions and adapt to a warmer climate, the world needs suitable technologies in order to make low-carbon transitions in development right now, not seven years after a global stocktake.\u000a\u000aParis deal and the future\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCOP-21 adopted the \u2018Joint annual report of the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network\u2019. Under the Paris deal, there will be a framework to provide guidance for the technology mechanism, provide enhanced action on technology development and assess technologies ready for transfer. A link between financial and technology mechanisms has also been established, which should allow for collaboration in research and development. Whether this will go as far as India wanted in providing financial support to deal with IPR barriers in the future is not entirely clear.\u000a\u000aIt might be easier to grasp the linkages between energy efficiencies (therefore, mitigation) and technology needs. But a policy and regulatory regime that promotes innovation within countries, transfers suitable technologies from outside, and supports the equity-sensitive application of new technologies is important. For example, while it is important to promote and use solar pumps in agriculture in India, the crisis caused by over-extraction of groundwater and its contamination can only be addressed if regulation plays a critical role. Otherwise, the country would continue to overexploit groundwater with solar pumps. Understanding these linkages between technologies, policies and regulations and making appropriate institutional changes would be necessary for climate adaptation and climate friendly development.\u000a\u000a(Sujatha Byravan is Principal Research Scientist at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, Bengaluru.)

VUNITED NATIONS | Jan 27: The UN secretary-general is challenging investors around the world to at least double their investments in clean energy by 2020. Ban Ki-moon told an investor summit on climate risk Wednesday that increasing investment in clean energy is critical in following up on the landmark agreement to tackle climate change reached in Paris last year.Ban says that about $330 billion was invested in clean energy last year, but that is far from what he calls the ``clean trillion'' needed per year in the decades to come.The UN chief also says he has invited all of the world's heads of states and government to attend an April 22 signing ceremony for the climate agreement, and that 55 countries' signatures are needed to put the agreement into effect.

V* 2015 issuance reached record $42.4 bln\u000a\u000a* Paris agreement has sparked more interest in green bonds\u000a\u000aBy Nina Chestney\u000a\u000aLONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The global agreement reached at the climate summit in Paris could prompt the amount of bonds this year issued to finance low-carbon projects to exceed $50 billion, Moody\u2019s Investor Service said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThis would follow a record $42.4 billion issuance in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe proceeds from so-called green bonds help finance projects such as renewable energy, the energy efficiency sector, green transport and wastewater treatment.\u000a\u000aIn the fourth quarter of last year, the issuance of green bonds reached $15.2 billion, the strongest quarterly volume of the year, boosted by activity by financial institutions ahead of talks in Paris in December to secure a global climate agreement.\u000a\u000aThis helped raise last year\u2019s total issuance to its highest ever level since the market began in 2007, a report by Moody\u2019s Investor Service said.\u000a\u000aThe global climate summit in Paris late last year agreed a landmark deal, committing both rich and poor nations to rein in rising emissions blamed for global warming.\u000a\u000aFollowing the agreement, Moody\u2019s expects green bonds to attract more attention because meeting emissions-cut targets will need trillions of dollars of capital from the public and private sectors.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe expect the momentum from the UN Conference on Climate Change, as well as the signing of the Paris Agreement scheduled this April, to likely motivate additional and repeat issuance of green bonds,\u201d Henry Shilling, a Moody\u2019s senior vice president said in a statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn this favourable environment, even after more recent bond market headwinds and assuming a resumption of the growth rates seen in 2012-14, issuance could exceed $50 billion by a significant margin,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThe green bond market is still a tiny part of the overall bond market. Although green bonds are no different from other bonds, they must finance environmentally sound projects, but there are differing views across the world on what that means.\u000a\u000aCommonly agreed standards on what constitutes a green bond and transparency over how proceeds are used are needed to make the market become more mainstream.\u000a\u000aLondon\u2019s financial market launched a push last month to encourage pension and insurance funds to invest in green bonds, with a focus on creating a framework for the sector.\u000a\u000aEditing by Jeremy Gaunt.

VMan-made significantly enhanced the risk of the severe that ravaged southern England two years ago, according to a study released today.\u000a\u000aGlobal warming amplified the likelihood of the "once-in-a-century" heavy flooding -- responsible for some 600 million euros ($650 million) in insured losses during the winter of 2013/2014 -- by more than 40%, researchers reported.\u000a\u000a"We found that extreme rainfall, as seen in January 2014, is more likely to occur in a changing climate," said Nathalie Shaller, lead author and a scientist at Oxford University.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, is part of a growing body of scientific literature seeking to connect the dots between long-term warming and extreme weather events.\u000a\u000aIt is a difficult case to establish.\u000a\u000aThe main reason is that climate trends are measured in decades or longer, making it very hard -- when trying to tease out cause and effect -- to separate natural weather variability from human-induced warming.\u000a\u000aIn the new study, two-thirds of the additional risk of major catastrophe could be traced to an increase in the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere, and one third to more days with winds coming across the Atlantic from the west, the study concluded.\u000a\u000aClimate models predict that both these patterns become more frequent under global warming conditions, the researchers noted.\u000a\u000aUnlike previous attempts to link with specific extreme weather events, Shaller and colleagues traced the connections "all the way from the changes in the atmosphere to the impacts on the ground," she said.\u000a\u000aStarting with an analysis of circulation in the atmosphere, they also looked at the additional risk of rainfall, as well as swollen river flows.\u000a\u000aThe final step, she said, was calculating flood potential in the Thames River Basin, right down to "the number of properties at risk," she said.\u000a\u000a"To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to connect all these factors together."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScientists not involved in the study confirmed that it broke new ground.

VWASHINGTON: The global temperature does not rise or fall chaotically in the long run and should remain stable unless pushed by outside forces, according to a new study.Scientists at the Duke University and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory examined how Earth cools itself down after a period of natural warming.The new evidence contradicts the belief that long-term global warming occurs in an unpredictable manner, independently of external drivers such as human impacts."This underscores that large, sustained changes in global temperature like those observed over the last century require drivers such as increased greenhouse gas concentrations," said lead author Patrick Brown, a PhD student at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.Natural climate cycles alone are insufficient to explain such changes, he said.Using global climate models and NASA satellite observations of Earth's energy budget from the last 15 years, the study found that a warming Earth is able to restore its temperature equilibrium through complex and seemingly paradoxical changes in the atmosphere and the way radiative heat is transported.Scientists have long attributed this stabilisation to a phenomenon known as the Planck Response, a large increase in infrared energy that Earth emits as it warms.Acting as a safety valve of sorts, this response creates a negative radiative feedback that allows more of the accumulating heat to be released into space through the top of the atmosphere."Our analysis confirmed that the Planck Response plays a dominant role in restoring global temperature stability, but to our surprise we found that it tends to be overwhelmed locally by heat-trapping positive energy feedbacks related to changes in clouds, water vapour, and snow and ice," Brown said."This initially suggested that the climate system might be able to create large, sustained changes in temperature all by itself," he said.A more detailed investigation of the satellite observations and climate models helped the researchers finally reconcile what was happening globally versus locally."While global temperature tends to be stable due to the Planck Response, there are other important, previously less appreciated, mechanisms at work too," said Wenhong Li, assistant professor of climate at Duke.These other mechanisms include a net release of energy over regions that are cooler during a natural, unforced warming event.There can be a transport of energy from the tropical Pacific to continental and polar regions where the Planck Response overwhelms positive, heat-trapping local effects.The research was published in the Journal of Climate.

VThe districts of Marathwada and Vidarbha witnessing maximum farmer suicides in Maharashtra face higher risk to climate change. A report by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) recommends the state government to initiate policies and measures to adapt to climate changes that would be detrimental to the agro-sector in 14 districts affected by severe drought across Vidarbha and Marathwada.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Central Research Institute for Dryland Farming, \u201cThe districts in Marathwada and Vidarbha face very high risk to climate change. Studies warn that if no action is taken, financial implications on account of damages due to climate change would be massive. Mumbai alone can incur financial damages of as much as Rs 2 trillion due to climate change-related damages.\u201d\u000a\u000aCRIDA has also mapped the vulnerability atlas of India, a collection of maps showing parts of India vulnerable to natural disasters.\u000a\u000aAt least 80 per cent of the total area under agriculture cultivation is rainfed in Maharashtra. \u201cClimate change was never factored in our policy-making or annual state budget. Now, for the first time in 2014-15, unseasonal hailstorm and changing rain patterns extending to longer dry spells have come as an eye opener to policymakers in the state,\u201d said sources in the agriculture and irrigation ministry.\u000a\u000aOut of the total 355 talukas in the state, 226 talukas received deficiant rain. While 112 talukas received normal rainfall, only 17 talukas received excess rainfall.\u000a\u000aAccording to officials, a study done by TERI has identified Maharashtra as one of the most vulnerable states in India. Based on biophysical, social and technological indicators, the state has low \u201cadaptive capacity\u201d to climate change, meaning that it has little potential to respond successfully to climate variability and change, including adjustments in resources and technologies.\u000a\u000aThe state falls in the zone of high to very high climate sensitivity, with a widespread dependence on agriculture.\u000a\u000aThe region is also interpreted as an area of \u201cdouble exposure\u201d where globalisation and climate change pose simultaneous challenges to the agriculture sector.\u000a\u000aChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, along with the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), has sought funds to undertake adaption and mitigation measures to tackle climate change.\u000a\u000aThe ministry has approved a proposal submitted by the state government related to challenges in agriculture growth due to climate change.Apart from the \u201cJalyukt Shivar\u201d water conservation project, the government has emphasised on crop pattern changes and promoting horticulture.\u000a\u000aWater management has been accorded the highest priority and the government is pushing for the adoption of new technologies to cope with the shortage in rainfall.\u000a\u000aThe policy also includes agriculture practices to improve soil fertility. Higher yield and lower input cost is being modelled to help farmers.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App

VNEW DELHI: You don\u2019t have to worry about burning a hole in your wallet for LED (light emitting diode) bulbs. You can now snap one up at Rs 99 with a few clicks of the mouse, with the government joining the etail bandwagon to take its Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP) to people\u2019s doorstep.Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a special purpose vehicle formed by state-run companies under the power ministry, has tied up with Snapdeal, one of the major online marketplaces in the country, for selling these energy-efficient bulbs.EESL is implementing the Modi government\u2019s programme to financially assist consumers to replace less efficient CFL or incandescent lights with latest LED bulbs. The scheme is aimed at saving thousands of crores for consumers and reducing demand as well as carbon emission.A tie-up with Snapdeal would help the government expand its marketing and distribution reach over 5,000 cities and towns to push use of LED bulbs beyond DELP.EESL has so far distributed nearly 5.6 crore bulbs. This has resulted in saving daily peak demand of 1,735 mw \u2013 or nearly a third of Delhi\u2019s consumption \u2013 amounting to daily cost saving of over Rs 7,000 crore and reducing greenhouse emissions equivalent to 16,092 tonnes of CO2.The government wants to replace all 77 crore incandescent bulbs sold in India with LED bulbs. This would result in reduction of 20,000 mw load, energy savings of 105 billion units and reduce greenhouse gas emission equivalent to 80 million tonnes of CO2 every year. The annual saving in electricity bills is estimated at Rs 40,000 crore, considering an average tariff of Rs 4 per unit.

VFrench environment minister Segolene Royal said Wednesday she would head the UN\u2019s COP21 climate forum after a long-time political rival, former foreign minister Laurent Fabius, stepped down from that role.\u000a\u000aFrench President Francois Hollande \u201coffered me the opportunity yesterday to take on this responsibility, and I accepted,\u201d she told French television news channel iTELE.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for Hollande\u2019s office confirmed the appointment but said a date had not been set.\u000a\u000aCOP21 is the acronym for the 21st conference of parties to the UN climate arena.\u000a\u000aIts president comes from the country who hosts the forum\u2019s annual high-level gathering, and usually plays a key role in brokering agreements in the complex negotiations.\u000a\u000aFabius, appointed in November, was hailed for shepherding the 195 nations to a historic deal in Paris that involves curbing carbon emissions and channelling hundreds of billions of dollars to poor countries exposed to climate change.\u000a\u000aHe was pressured to relinquish the job on Monday after he stepped down as foreign minister and was named to head France\u2019s constitutional court.\u000a\u000aCritics argued that he could not simultaneously be on the court, which is supposed to be above the political fray, and also in charge of the COP, where politics and powerful interests collide.\u000a\u000aRoyal, Hollande\u2019s former companion and the mother of their four children, was among the first to raise objections, calling for \u201cthe rules to be clarified\u201d on double postings.\u000a\u000aIn her new role, Royal will guide the first steps for implementing the December agreement, which set the ambitious goal of capping global warming at \u201cwell under two degrees Celsius\u201d (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aThe 32-page deal also calls on rich nations to muster at least 100 billion dollars (90 billion euros) a year in climate aid from 2020. Just how that will happen has yet to be worked out.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t let the momentum slip,\u201d Royal told AFP. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do. I have already started.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong her priorities, she said, are putting a price on carbon and climate action in Africa.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfrica can be a laboratory for transitioning away from fossil fuels using solar, geothermal, hydroelectricity,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need a systematic approach, and we have to get moving before the end of 2016.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoyal will also seek to highlight a signing ceremony for the agreement on April 22 at the United Nations in New York. She has said Hollande will attend and encourage other heads of state to join him.\u000a\u000aFrance will hands on the climate baton to Morocco, which will organise COP22 in Marrakesh from November 7 to 18.

VParts of Ghana are reeling under acute water shortage as taps have stopped running and raw water sources are drying up.\u000a\u000aA combination of drought and illegal mining activities as well as unsafe environmental practices has conspired to make raw water sources unproductive for a country that seeks to achieve universal coverage by 2025, Xinhua reported.\u000a\u000aResidents of Nsawam Adoagyiri, about 50 km north-west of the capital, are battling an acute water shortage as the Densu river, the source of raw water to serve the communities, has dried up.\u000a\u000aFarming activities by the residents along the banks, lumbering and bush burning have been cited as factors leading to the shortage of raw water sources in the community and other areas in Ghana.\u000a\u000aIt is common to see schoolchildren and women carrying different receptacles in search of water.\u000a\u000aResidents have to depend on an outlet of the Densu river which they fetch for cooking and drinking.\u000a\u000aBesides Nsawam, portions around Ho, 156 km north-east of the capital, have also been battling water shortages since the beginning of the year, while parts of the coastal western region are also facing similar challenges.\u000a\u000aThere is already severe drought in the country as there have not been any rains since November last year.\u000a\u000a"Rivers are our main sources of raw material and so if these rivers dry up, there is nothing we can do but to wait till they get filled up again," Stanley Martey, communications manager of the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), told Xinhua over the phone.\u000a\u000aHe alluded to illegal mining and other human activities such as farming along the river banks, bush burning and general pollution as the causes of the drying up of the water bodies.\u000a\u000a"You are aware that the current water shortage is due to drought and climate change factors," the communication manager added.\u000a\u000aMartey said the GWCL was making preparations to drill boreholes in communities affected most by the water shortage.\u000a\u000a"This is in addition to the 1,000 boreholes project by the Chinese government which is also about to commence soon," he added.\u000a\u000aIn addition, he said the water company had started dredging works in river beds that had been silted due to many human activities in readiness for the raining season, while tree planting was about to commence along rivers which have their vegetative cover depleted.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ambitious plan to give a push to renewable energy by bundling costlier solar power with cheap electricity produced in old thermal plants has failed to take-off. After several States, now even Delhi has refused to give its consent to the proposal fearing it would result in higher power tariffs in the city.\u000a\u000aIn a letter to NTPC Limited, the Delhi government has rejected to buy electricity bundled with solar power saying that \u201cit would lead to increase in cost for end consumers.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollowing the PM\u2019s model, NTPC had written to six States, including Delhi, which procure power from the old Singrauli thermal power station. Delhi\u2019s share from the Singrauli plant is about 400-500 MW which is bought by the distribution companies at Rs 1.80 per unit. Bundling 3,000 MW of solar power with the power procured from this plant will push the cost to Rs. 3.12 per unit, Delhi government officials said. The letter written to the electricity generating giant by Principal Secretary (Power) Sukesh Jain questions the NTPC\u2019s proposal to bundle solar power with just one plant and not other ageing plants like Badarpur, Rihand-I, Unchaar-I, Farakka Unit-I, Talcher Stage-I and so on that have lived the useful life of 25 years.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, if NTPC insists on such bundling and vintage is the criteria for bundling, then Badarpur Thermal Power Station is of much older age, commissioned between 1973 and 1981, while Singrauli Power Station was commissioned between 1982 and 1987. It is, therefore, suggested that instead of Singrauli Power Station, 3,000 MW solar power be bundled with Badarpur Thermal Power Station first subject to the concurrence of States having allocation of power from this plant,\u201d read the letter.\u000a\u000aIt further highlights that the power purchase agreements (PPAs) are \u201cbi-lateral\u201d pacts.\u000a\u000aSources in the NTPC said that not many have actually agreed to the proposal. While the NDA-ruled Rajasthan and Haryana agreed to the plan, others like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and others have rejected it. Bundling of power with Singruali plant was supposed to be a pilot project of the larger plan for the Ministry of Power.

VThe biophysical changes occurring due to global warming are also reallocating global wealth in unpredictable -- and potentially destabilising -- ways, says a new study.\u000a\u000a"People are mostly focused on the physical reallocation of these assets, but I don't think we've really started thinking enough about how climate change can reallocate wealth and influence the prices of those assets," said lead author Eli Fenichel from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.\u000a\u000a"We think these price impacts can be really, really important," Fenichel added.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, suggests the impacts on net global wealth may not be that straightforward. In fact, changes are more likely than not to produce an overall net loss in global wealth.\u000a\u000aThe reason, said Fenichel, is the inevitable and unpredictable price impacts in places where the quantities of fish stocks increase depending on the quality of its resource management, existing institutions, and fishing regulations.\u000a\u000a"We don't know how this will unfold, but we do know there will be price effects. It's just Economics 101 -- prices reflect quantity and scarcity and natural capital is hard for people to move," he said.\u000a\u000a"It's as inevitable as the movement of these fish species," Fenichel added.\u000a\u000aThese impacts on the value of natural capital highlight the need for coherent climate policies that integrate biophysical and social measurements, the study said.

VThe Economic Survey finds that India will find it hard to meet its variety of obligations to tackle climate change without substantial help from the private sector.\u000a\u000a\u201cSuccessful implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the ambitious targets set out in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) will require huge financial resources which cannot be met through budgetary sources alone. Leveraging private finance along with public finance, both international and national, will be critical,\u201d says the chapter on climate change and sustainable development in the Survey.\u000a\u000aThe SDGs set by the United Nations last September lay the onus on countries to make significant progress on a wide range of goals including ending poverty and hunger and combating climate change. The INDCs are plans by governments communicated to the United Nations climate change council regarding the steps they will take to address climate change domestically.\u000a\u000aIndia, the Survey adds, could benefit from the renewed global focus on adopting and developing green technology but there could be international \u201cpressure\u201d to commit to a date beyond which its emissions wouldn\u2019t increase. This is one of the sticking points between the U.S. and India and China on doing more to contain their greenhouse gas emissions. As part of its domestic climate commitments, India has said it would source nearly 60,000 MW of its energy by wind-power and 1,00,000 MW megawatts via solar power by 2022. The latter is extremely ambitious considering that as of today only 5% of this proposed solar capacity has been installed. The Survey also notes that a mission on Climate Change and Health \u2014 mooted since early 2015 \u2014 is being developed and a National Expert Group on Climate Change and Health has been constituted.

VThe New Development Bank (NDB) \u2014 a multilateral lender with a focus on the Global South of the of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping \u2014 is all set to fund more than a dozen projects this year that will focus on renewable energy.\u000a\u000aNDB President K.V. Kamath revealed at a media conference that the \u201cinitial focus\u201d of the bank would on green energy projects. \u201cI think it would be safe to say that more than half the projects both in number and value would be green and that is something that we are consciously doing and we are heartened by the response we are getting from various governments in proposing such projects,\u201d Mr. Kamath observed.\u000a\u000aHe added that the lending, which will commence in April, would fund a project each from the five member grouping. But he added that 10-15 projects are in the pipeline for the remaining part of the year.\u000a\u000aThe NDB President \u2014 on the eve of the signing of the Headquarters Agreement with the Chinese government that will officially launch the bank for operations \u2014 clarified that the lender was not geared to issue soft loans. \u201cOn the rate of interest, we will not be lending on concessional terms. That was not the intent at all. We will need to factor our own cost of funds and add an appropriate margin.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added the \u201ccost of funds would be determined by our actual experience in the market. So we will function as a prudent bank should.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Kamath explained that the NDB would include market borrowing to raise capital, but stressed that bonds in local currency, rather than hard currency, would be favoured. \u201cWe will be resorting to bond issues. As has been said earlier, we will raise it in local currencies where it is feasible and of course we will supplement where it is required in with dollar bond issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NDB\u2019s initial capital has been fixed at $50 billion, and the total paid in capital would be $10 billion. Analysts point out that following the 2008 financial crisis, the NDB and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) \u2014 both geared towards infrastructure development in Asia and the Global South \u2014 are reshaping the global financial architecture, a field that had been monopolised by western backed International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\u000a\u000aWith Africa also one of its focal points, the NDB is set to open an African Regional Centre, headquartered in Johannesburg, by the second half of this year. It would aim to develop a \u201cproject pipeline\u201d for the continent, a press statement said.\u000a\u000aThe NDB \u201cwill soon become a strong and well-respected international financial institution, playing a leading role in the changing international financial architecture,\u201d observed Anton Silunov, Russia\u2019s Finance Minister, who also steered Friday\u2019s media interaction. He pointed out that the G-20 countries had now to mainstream the role of institutions such as the NDB and the AIIB in shaping the global economy.\u000a\u000aOn the eve of its operational launch, the NDB has bagged a AAA institutional rating from domestic credit rating agencies in China, where the China Development Bank and the Bank of China have been appointed as rating advisers. Standard Chartered and Goldman Sachs are in the saddle as international rating advisors.

VNEW DELHI: Supporting India's decision to challenge WTO ruling which held the government's power purchase agreements with solar firms as "inconsistent", Greenpeace today said the ruling "violates" the spirit of Paris climate change agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRuling against India, the WTO recently had said India's power purchase agreements with solar firms were 'inconsistent' with international norms - a matter in which the US had filed a complaint before the global trade body alleging discrimination against American firms.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGreenpeace India and Greenpeace USA have criticised the ruling and expressed support to the Indian government's decision to go for an appeal against it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"India's setting of Domestic Content Requirement (DCR) was based on a worthy core principle - increasing economic opportunities and creating thousands of green jobs while taking critically important steps in the global fight against climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"It is ridiculous that the WTO does not recognise this principle and points to the danger to developing countries that such international trade regimes pose," said Pujarini Sen, campaigner, Greenpeace India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"The WTO ruling - and the US decision to pursue it - is a setback to India's renewable energy ambitions. By challenging this decision, the Indian government is demonstrating commitment to India's fledgling solar manufacturing sector, which needs initial support to enable it to compete with the price of imported products and to its own roadmap for a green economy solution to global climate change," Sen said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe US had dragged India to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on this issue in 2014, alleging that the clause relating to domestic content requirement (DCR) in the country's solar power mission were discriminatory in nature and "nullified" benefits accruing to American solar power developers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ruling was a blow to India which has announced a target of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, of which 100 GW will be realised through the National Solar Mission.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGreenpeace also called on the US to stay true to its stated position where it "repeatedly" stressed the need for other major polluters, including India, to move away from their dependency on coal and towards a low carbon future.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Pursuing this WTO challenge could hamper India's ambitious solar programme when it starts to do precisely that," the NGO said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt also termed the US position at WTO as "hypocritical" as the US implements similar domestic content requirements and subsidies to strengthen the renewable energy sector within its borders.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt said most US states have Local Content Requirements (LCR) and subsidies, making India's DCR very much in keeping with accepted industry practices.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"If President (Barack) Obama wants the US to be a global leader on climate change, he must instruct his officials to drop any opposition to clean energy initiatives in other countries, starting with India's ambitious 100 GW solar programme," said Kelly Mitchell, Climate Campaign Director, Greenpeace US.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia crossed 5 GW of installed solar capacity in December 2015, while placing itself to be one of the leaders in solar energy internationally and also included the formation of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) of solar rich countries by Prime Minister Modi at the Paris COP.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia also tried to meet the US halfway by proposing that they would not DCR for commercial use and buy solar panels with such requirements for its own consumption only such as railways and defence but the US was still not appeased.

(Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)\u000a\u000aA move that began as a minor levy on production of coal six years ago has become an important source of revenue for the government now, financing entire budget of some ministries and supporting clean and green activities.\u000a\u000aFinance Minister Arun Jaitley Monday increased the cess on coal production from Rs 200 per tonne to Rs 400 per tonne. He also said the Clean Energy Cess would be renamed as Clean Environment Cess.\u000a\u000aThis was the third time the cess was doubled, since being introduced as Rs 50 per tonne in the 2010 budget. When it was doubled from Rs 100 per tonne to Rs 200 per tonne last year, it was estimated that it would contribute about Rs 13,000 crore to National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) every year. With the value of this fund going up further with the latest hike, the entire budget allocation for Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for this year \u2014 Rs 5,000 crore \u2014 is proposed to come from NCEF. Half the plan outlay for Environment Ministry, about Rs 1,000 crore, is also proposed to be met through this fund.\u000a\u000aAt the end of last year, the NCEF, which gets contributions from some other sources besides this cess on coal, had almost\u000a\u000aRs 17,000 crore in its kitty. India produces coal in excess of 600 million tonnes a year. It imports about 150 million tonnes every year to meet its demand. The cess applies to imported coal as well.\u000a\u000a\u2018FDI will boost food processing industry\u2019\u000a\u000aThe budget announcement of allowing 100 per cent FDI in marketing of food products made in India will double the processing industry for fruits and vegetables, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal told reporters on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App

VAt the UN Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, India put forth its strong commitment towards clean energy and announced its climate change plan, i.e. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) setting targets for domestic efforts against climate change.\u000a\u000aAmong other initiatives, key targets are 40% power installed capacity from non-fossil-fuel-based energy resources and reducing emissions by 33-35% of its GDP by 2030.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s INDC also sets a target of achieving 175 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity of renewable energy\u2014including 100GW of solar power and 60GW of wind power.\u000a\u000aIt would be reasonable to say that India has covered ground in the last fiscal; India launched the International Solar Alliance (ISA), a coalition of solar resource-rich countries, to address energy needs and common concerns.\u000a\u000aThe Renewable Energy Global Investment Promotion Meet and Expo (RE-INVEST) organized in February 2015, received satisfactory response from global investors. India also signed an MoU with Germany to promote solar energy.\u000a\u000aThe government has also launched programmes, including the Green Energy Corridors, a nationwide transmission grid dedicated to power generated from renewable energy projects; setting up of 25 solar parks with a capacity of 50MW each; ultra-mega solar power projects scheme; and the viability gap funding scheme for setting up solar power projects by offering project developers capital cost support.\u000a\u000aHowever, a challenge remains in the capital funding required for such capacity expansion. With the finance minister deciding to stick to fiscal consolidation and reining in the deficit, India\u2019s ability to further access debt resources is limited, due to an existing high debt ratio.\u000a\u000aIn this backdrop, the government has allocated an outlay of above Rs.10,000 crore for 2016-17. This outlay includes Rs.5,000 crore from the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) with the balance coming from Internal & Extra Budgetary Resource (IEBR). A significant part of viability gap funding for solar power projects is intended to be financed out of such cash outlay.\u000a\u000aThe finance minister mentioned diversification of sources of power for long-term stability and outlined his endeavour to augment investment in nuclear power generation in the long term. Changes have been proposed in the public-private partnership (PPP) mode to revive development of infrastructure.\u000a\u000aOn the taxation front, the clean environment cess on coal, lignite and peat has been doubled from Rs.200 per tonne to Rs.400 per tonne; encouraging the use of renewable sources of energy. Other proposals include extension of benefit of additional depreciation to businesses engaged in the transmission of power and exemption of capital gains arising on account of the appreciation of the rupee against a foreign currency at the time of redemption of rupee-denominated bonds.\u000a\u000aThe final road map for phasing out of tax incentives has also been rolled out. No profit-linked incentives have been extended to the power sector, or renewable energy in particular.\u000a\u000aTo this extent, the budget appears to be focusing more on administrative issues within the limits of fiscal prudence, like providing a legal framework for dispute resolution in PPP projects and measures to curb litigation in order to promote a non-adversarial tax regime.\u000a\u000aIn order to provide a fillip to the sector, especially in view of the ambitious targets for capacity enhancement set by the government, mobilization of finances is of utmost importance.\u000a\u000aGokul Chaudhri is a partner at BMR & Associates.

VIndia will be among the worst hit countries and face a large number of deaths due to changes in diets and bodyweight from reduced crop productivity, according to a new study on climate change led by the University of Oxford.\u000a\u000aThe estimate based on a modelling study said climate change could kill more than 500,000 adults worldwide in 2050. The study from the university\u2019s Martin Future of Food programme was published on Thursday in the medical journal The Lancet.\u000a\u000aThe countries that are likely to be worst affected are low- income and middle-income countries, mainly those in the Western Pacific region (264,000 additional deaths) and Southeast Asia (164,000), with almost three-quarters of all climate-related deaths expected to occur in China (248,000) and India (136,000).\u000a\u000aThe research is considered the strongest evidence yet that climate change could have damaging consequences for food production and health worldwide, a university statement said.\u000a\u000aThe study led by Marco Springmann is the first of its kind to assess the impact of climate change on diet composition and bodyweight. The study estimates the number of deaths these two factors will cause in 2050 in 155 countries, the statement added.\u000a\u000aThe study also said unless action is taken to reduce global emissions, climate change could cut the projected improvement in food availability by about a third by 2050, and lead to average per-person reductions in food availability of 3.2% (99 kcal per day), in fruit and vegetable intake of 4.0% (14.9g per day), and red meat consumption of 0.7% (0.5g per day).\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that in 2050, these changes could be responsible for around 529,000 extra deaths. We looked at the health effects of changes in agricultural production that are likely to result from climate change and found that even modest reductions in the availability of food per person could lead to changes in the energy content and composition of diets, and these changes will have major consequences for health,\u201d Springmann said.\u000a\u000aCutting emissions could have substantial health benefits, reducing the number of climate-related deaths by 29%-71% depending on the strength of the interventions, the study added.\u000a\u000a\u201cAdaptation efforts need to be scaled up rapidly. Public health programmes aimed at preventing and treating diet- and weight-related risk factors, such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake, must be strengthened as a matter of priority to help mitigate climate-related health effects,\u201d Springmann said.

VA new study has revealed that climate change could cause significant changes to global diets, leading to more than half a million extra deaths by 2050.\u000a\u000aThe research is the strongest evidence yet that climate change could have damaging consequences for food production and health worldwide and is the first of its kind to assess the impact of climate change on diet composition and bodyweight, and to estimate the number of deaths they will cause in 155 countries in 2050.\u000a\u000aResearcher Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford said that much research has looked at food security, but little has focussed on the wider health effects of agricultural production. Changes in food availability and intake also affect dietary and weight-related risk factors.\u000a\u000aThere will be an increase in heart diseases, stroke and cancer.\u000a\u000aThe countries that are likely to be worst affected are low-and middle-income countries, predominantly those in the Western Pacific region (2,64,000 deaths) and Southeast Asia (1,64,000), with almost three-quarters of all climate-related deaths expected to occur in China (2,48,000) and India (1,36,000).\u000a\u000aOn a per-capita basis, also Greece (124 deaths per million people) and Italy (89 deaths per million people) are likely to be significantly affected.

VRising temperatures worldwide are changing not only weather systems but also the distribution of water around the globe, thereby affecting the availability of potable water, a new study has found.\u000a\u000aResearchers analysed more than 40 years of water samples archived at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in the US and found how the sources of precipitation have changed.\u000a\u000aOver the years, there has been a dramatic increase, especially during the winter, of the amount of water that originated far to the north, researchers said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the later years, we saw more water derived from evaporation of the Arctic and the North Atlantic oceans,\u201d said Tamir Puntsag from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) in New York. The study marked the first time scientists have used specific measurements to demonstrate how water sources are changing, especially in northeastern US.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate change has an important relationship to the water cycle. It goes beyond temperature effects,\u201d said Myron Mitchell, an ESF biogeochemist.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis study shows how climate change is altering the spatial patterns and amounts of precipitation \u2014 where it comes from and where it falls.\u000a\u000aSuch effects can drastically affect the availability of potable water and also contribute to the massive flooding we have seen in recent years,\u201d Mitchell said.\u000a\u000aAs record warmer temperatures in the Arctic cause dramatic decreases in the depth and coverage of sea ice, the Arctic vortex (often called the polar vortex) has become less stable, occasionally spilling frigid air onto the eastern US, such as occurred in October last year and February this year, when areas from New York to Miami experienced record cold, researchers said.\u000a\u000aThe findings of the study will help scientists understand changes that are likely to affect global water resources, Mitchell said. With 85 per cent of the world\u2019s population living in the driest half of the planet and 783 million people living without access to clean water, according to the United Nations, it is vital for scientists and policymakers to understand how a changing climate affects water resources, researchers said.PTI

VThe environment ministry\u2019s special secretary, Susheel Kumar, said earlier this week that the Indian government is now looking to retrofit existing national action plans on climate change while building new ones. With the date of signing of the historic Paris climate change agreement in April approaching fast, and its ratification to follow soon, that\u2019s good to hear. But the entire process will require care and finesse\u2014particularly the groundwork for integration with the world\u2019s networked carbon market.\u000a\u000aThis is a necessary condition for getting adequate circulation of the new carbon currency founded in Paris\u2014internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. To de-jargonize: in a world carbon balance sheet with a fixed net carbon credit, countries will be allowed to trade their credits to other nations if they do not use up their Assigned Amount Units due to lower emissions. This might be due to adjustment of anthropogenic emissions at source or removal by sinks.\u000a\u000aA third of the nations which announced their intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) before the Paris talks have already concurred on setting up of carbon markets. But these are not the only possible model. While they consist of governments determining the quantitative cap and markets determining price\u2014allowing domestic trade in carbon credits\u2014the alternative of carbon taxation has the government fixing the upstream price of fossil fuels, allowing markets to determine the optimal quantity of use.\u000a\u000aThe latter Pigouvian tax (named after English economist Arthur Pigou) to mould optimal social outcomes and choices is the most suited option for the Indian scenario. The average Indian\u2019s carbon footprint is below the average per capita emission of many other countries. And Indian techniques are still struggling to keep pace with the decarbonizing rates of the developed world. Capping carbon without alternatives can thus compromise development. The right carbon tax levels, meanwhile, can internalize the social externality of emissions and make it part of an individual\u2019s choice set in a more optimal manner.\u000a\u000aBut this also points to the core problem. India\u2014and developing countries in general\u2014got the raw end of the deal at Paris with an entirely disproportionate burden in the context of historical emission trends and development needs. Not acting is not an option either; various studies have shown that the long-term costs of climate change in developing economies significantly outweigh the short-term costs of climate change mitigation efforts. The trick, then, is to find the correct balance that does not impose disproportionately heavy costs in the near future.\u000a\u000aThe commodities crash has presented the government with that opportunity. The current tax levels\u2014India has a de facto carbon tax on its petroleum and oil products and a green tax on coal\u2014do not adequately consider the intensity of emissions in the country. The prevailing low oil prices make it the right time to remedy this by introducing a variable stabilizing carbon tax\u2014one which rises when fuel prices fall and falls when fuel prices rise. This can ensure that the polluter will pay, keep emissions in check and incentivize the right innovation and the right kind of energy\u2014all without hitting the pace of development too hard.\u000a\u000aThat said, this alone will not suffice. Fuel is less price elastic and more income elastic in India. This implies increasing carbon taxes alone will be insufficient to reduce emissions as income levels rise. The price inelasticity is mainly due to the absence of alternative energy sources and, in the past, fuel subsidies. The International Solar Alliance and Make in India for low-cost renewable technologies are good policy initiatives in the right direction; they must be given greater impetus.\u000a\u000aThere are a host of complementary measures to consider as well\u2014from decarbonizing production of electricity to research and development aimed at improving energy and resource efficiency; from reducing waste to preserving and increasing carbon sinks.\u000a\u000aIf New Delhi has to achieve its INDC target\u2014reduction by 33-35% of the 2005 levels by 2030\u2014and hook itself into the international carbon market, a long-term strategy with the variable carbon tax at its core is a must.\u000a\u000aDo you think India\u2019s carbon taxation regime is sufficient to meet its INDC target?

VEveryone knows that at some point, if we want to contain climate change, we\u2019ll have to stop building polluting power plants. New research suggests that moment may come much sooner than we realize.\u000a\u000aIn some areas, the world is making progress toward reducing harmful emissions. Earlier this year, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy reported that the use of coal-fired plants for electricity generation in the US fell to the lowest level in 60 years. Some of the biggest US coal mining outfits have filed for bankruptcy. Electricity from coal looks set to become increasingly rare in China as well. That\u2019s good news for anyone hoping that humanity might still manage to reduce carbon emissions enough to avoid warming the earth\u2019s climate past the 2 degrees Celsius that scientists see as dangerous.\u000a\u000aEven so, trends globally aren\u2019t so encouraging. Developing nations plan to build a lot more fossil-fuel generating stations, and global carbon emissions are still increasing. Electricity generation still contributes about one-fourth of all human-created greenhouse gas emissions. The crucial question, then, is whether we will manage the transition to zero carbon production in time\u2014and how much time we have.\u000a\u000aA new study by researchers from Oxford University\u2019s Institute for New Economic Thinking offers an answer. In short, we have only a year or so to stop investing in new fossil-fuel power stations. After that, the expected emissions from those plants over their economic lifetime will commit us\u2014barring other exceptional changes\u2014to shoot past the 2 degree limit. This means we face crucial choices right now.\u000a\u000aThe trouble, as Alexander Pfeiffer and colleagues point out, is the amount of emissions already built into the system. Electricity infrastructure lasts a long time: Some thermal plants in the European Union are as much as 50 years old, and we should expect new plants to be used over a similar period of time. So the stock of existing plants, and any new construction, has repercussions for emissions decades into the future.\u000a\u000aClimate dynamics add to the inertia. Once put into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide lasts for centuries, contributing to warming all the while. It\u2019s the total stock of carbon in the atmosphere, not what we happen to be emitting now, that matters most. Even if we reduce emissions quickly, the stock will decline much more slowly.\u000a\u000aTaking these inertias into account, and using data from the IPCC on global carbon budgets and various scenarios for plausible future emissions and technology changes, Pfeiffer and colleagues analysed how long we can go on building new fossil fuel power plants if we want to have a decent chance\u2014say, 50%\u2014 of staying within the two degree limit. To that end, they introduced the concept of the \u201ctwo degree capital stock\u201d\u2014the total amount of electricity generating capital we can create before we\u2019ve locked ourselves into dangerous warming.\u000a\u000aBy their estimate, if we don\u2019t shift all new electricity generation investment to zero-carbon technology by the end of 2017, we will face a number of unpalatable alternatives. They include accepting the likelihood of warming beyond the 2 degree limit, shutting down and writing off lots of the world\u2019s energy assets or putting our hopes on carbon-capture technology that does not yet exist.\u000a\u000aPfeiffer and colleagues don\u2019t mean to be doomsayers. Their aim is to help policymakers get a more realistic view of the time available for making the shift to clean energy. National commitments to phase out fossil fuel power generation tend to focus on targets for emissions reductions. The EU, for example, aims to cut 40% by 2030. But emissions at any moment aren\u2019t directly linked to the atmospheric carbon stock that causes warming, nor do they reflect the future trajectory of carbon emissions implied by existing infrastructure.\u000a\u000aPolicymakers need to think a lot more about the repercussions of the fossil fuel power plants currently being planned, as well as associated coal mines and oil and gas fields. What we do today will affect the options available to us for decades to come.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe Centre is without doubt justified in saying it will contest the ruling in the World Trade Organisation against India\u2019s policy of local sourcing of components as part of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission. The U.S. had taken to the WTO its case against India\u2019s policy of favouring domestic inputs in solar cells and solar modules, arguing that it amounted to a discriminatory trade practice and distorted the game. The verdict, which came last month, is a setback for India\u2019s Solar Mission, seen as the bedrock of efforts aimed at ensuring energy security and meeting the country\u2019s commitment to the collective global plan to limit global warming. In fact, over the last year India has scaled up its solar power ambitions, with the Narendra Modi government increasing fivefold the target set in 2009 to 100,000 MW. The WTO ruling obviously threatens the financial viability of the plan. India did offer to modify its stand on the issue, and agreed to apply the domestic content requirement only for buying solar panels used for government sector consumption. It even assured Washington that power generated from such subsidised panels would not be sold for commercial use. The U.S., however, did not agree. The challenge before the government is to sort out trade practice concerns in a manner that keeps the Solar Mission firmly on track. How it resolves the issue \u2014 and it would be well-advised to avoid standing on ego \u2014 will have repercussions not only on the country\u2019s green energy aspirations, but also on its capacity to negotiate sectoral roadblocks to its global-level \u201cMake in India\u201d lobbying.\u000a\u000aThe trade rift and the WTO ruling on the solar issue have yet again brought to the fore the absurdity of seeking a level playing field in an imperfect, highly unequal world. Nations often raise protection walls in some form or the other to suit their convenience or to further their political interests. The U.S. is no exception. At least nine States in that country have programmes that provide protection to domestic manufacturers. In this inter-connected environment, the challenge really lies in balancing global trade obligations with domestic social compulsions. If the U.S. cannot have other countries engaged in practices that disadvantage American workers and American businesses, as President Barack Obama said, India too cannot wish away the job concerns of its people. By providing a \u2018green angle\u2019 to its solar power programme, India has added a new dimension to the ongoing dispute. As countries across the world race to take steps to limit climate change, concerns like these will test international organisations and rule-making to work out solutions that do not obstruct, or even delay, these efforts. The world indeed requires a spirit of accommodative co-existence for the larger global good.

Temperatures over land, over the ocean and in the top 700 and 2,000 metres of the ocean all set new records.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur planet is sending a powerful message to world leaders to sign and implement the Paris agreement on climate change and cut greenhouse gases now before we pass the point of no return,\u201d Taalas said.\u000a\u000aDr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick from the University of New South Wales in Australia said the language was very strong for the WMO. \u201cThey are usually very conservative,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to put this report in context. 2014 was the hottest year on record to date too. We\u2019ve had something like 15 out of the 16 hottest years on record since the turn of the millennium,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t experienced a month that has been below average for over 30 years ... I think people forget climate change started happening a long time ago, before a lot of us were even born. Honestly, it\u2019s frightening.\u201d The report follows Nasa figures showing that February 2016 was the most unseasonably hot month on record by a massive margin, which climate scientists described as \u201cshocking\u201d.\u000a\u000aTaalas said \u201curgent and far-reaching measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions\u201d were needed to avoid temperature rises of 3C. He said investment in disaster early warning systems was essential to help communities adapt to climate change.\u000a\u000a\u2014  Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016\u000a\u000aSea level rise: to be more than expected\u000a\u000aThe current rate of global warming could raise sea levels by \u201cseveral meters\u201d over the coming century, rendering most of the world\u2019s coastal cities uninhabitable and helping unleash devastating storms, according to a paper published by James Hansen, the former NASA scientist who is considered the father of modern climate change awareness. The research references past climatic conditions, recent observations and future models. It warns that the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will contribute to a far worse sea level increase than previously thought.\u000a\u000aWithout a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the global sea level is likely to increase \u201cseveral meters over a timescale of 50 to 150 years\u201d, the paper states, warning that the Earth\u2019s oceans were six to nine meters higher during the Eemian period \u2014 an interglacial phase about 120,000 years ago that was less than 1C warmer than it is today.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aUnion Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said India, along with 100 other nations, would ratify the COP 21 Global Climate Agreement on April 22 at a high level signing ceremony to be convened at the UN Headquarters in New York.\u000a\u000aThe agreement, negotiated at the Paris summit in December 2015, sets out a global action plan to put the world on track by limiting global warming below 2 degree Celsius.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a symposium titled \u2018COP 21 \u2013 Building Synergies, Shaping Actions\u2019 organided by Mumbai University, Mr Javadekar described the Paris agreement as a victory of multilateralism and the one which helped correct image perception of India.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia was always perceived to be a naysayer and negative in its approach and took a corner seat in most of the international conferences. But in Paris, Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the concept of climate justice, driving home the message of sustainable development,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMr Javadekar said climate change was a reality with one degree rise in temperature caused by 150 years of uncontrolled carbon emission by the developed world. He said India accounted for only 3 per cent carbon emission, while cumulative US contribution was 30 per cent. He said Europe Canada, and other developed world contributed 50 per cent.

VCHANDIGARH: Haryana has made solar power plants mandatory for housing societies, industries and other specified categories of buildings."The notification has been issued in this regard to achieve higher trajectory for solar power generation and promote green energy ," principal secretary for renewable energy Ankur Gupta said.Under Haryana\u2019s solar power policy for 2016, the state government is providing various incentives including industrial status, exemption from change of land use approval and cess, free-wheeling and banking facility, exemption of T&D and cross-subsidy charges. Besides, the government has decided to purchase solar power over and above the solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO), Gupta said.He said 40 investors have signed memorandum of understanding adding to over Rs 98,000 crore with the aim of adding 8,531.75 MW of solar power, besides setting up of bio CNG, module or cell manufacturing, and research and development units in the state.Describing Haryana as an emerging state in the renewable energy sector, Gupta said that the government was encouraging small investors by reserving 20 per cent of the target for projects of 1-2 megawatt capacity, giving price preference of 2 per cent to the plants installed in the state.The government is also promoting rooftop solar power plants to replace diesel gensets in the state, with an aim to reduce pollution and emission of greenhouse gases. In Haryana, a solar power plant can work for about 330 days a year, every kilowatt of which produces about 1,600 units of electricity a year.A typical 1KW solar power plant costs Rs 55,000-60,000, after availing subsidy. While the payback period is four-five years, the system lasts for more than 25 years. The government is also providing 30 per cent subsidy, subject to a maximum of Rs 20,000 per kilowatt peak (kWp), on installation of solar power plants for certain categories of buildings, Gupta said.

VOne of the five labelled spruce trees as seen from the crane gondola at 40 m aboveground. Photo: Tamir Klein/University of Basil\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aA chance discovery in a mixed forest in Switzerland reveals that tree-to-tree interaction in forests goes beyond mere competition for resources.\u000a\u000aForest trees are even more interconnected than thought, suggests a new study, which showed that around 40 per cent of the carbon in fine roots of spruce trees came from neighbouring trees. This level of sharing can be crucial for forests, especially under stress conditions like wildfires, say the authors in their paper published in Science recently.\u000a\u000aHuman-driven activities have been releasing vast amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere since industrialisation began two hundred years ago. Consequently, there is a lot of interest in understanding to what degree forests the largest terrestrial pool of biological carbon, are able to absorb this amount, thereby mitigating climate change, said Tamir Klein who studies eco-physiology at University of Basil, Switzerland, in an email interview sent to me.\u000a\u000aWhile investigating the responses of trees to elevated CO 2 , Klein and team stumbled upon this discovery. To track the flow of carbon, they had used a tall canopy crane to label five 40-metre-tall Norway spruce trees with stable carbon isotope 13. Five unlabelled spruce trees were used as control. The labelled and unlabelled trees were then measured for C-13 from \u201ctip to toe\u201d - canopy twigs, stems, and fine roots. This was also done for neighbouring unlabelled non-spruce trees. Their methodology ensured no label transfer to other trees. However, the team noticed something unexpected. \u201cWe discovered that labelled carbon does find its way to other trees, albeit in the root zone,\u201d said Klein.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the numbers revealed that roots of neighbouring trees, species no bar, shared an almost similar isotopic signature. The scientists strongly suspect that this interaction is mediated by networks of symbiotic fungi called mycorrhiza which connect the roots of different trees. \u201cMycorrhizal networks are very common in most forests across biomes and climates. In spruce forests they are so common that they are considered a substantial carbon sink,\u201d said Klein.\u000a\u000aMuch about the magnitude, direction and the regulation of these transfers is yet unclear. Since all the trees in the study were healthy, and stress-free the authors acknowledged the possibility that the labelled trees were transferring its excess carbon below ground and, in turn, triggering mycorrhizal growth and activity. However, this level of carbon sharing capabilities among neighbouring trees may have implications for forests under stress. \u201cWe hypothesise that under stress conditions, trees which are connected to each other through the \u201cright\u201d mycorrhiza species (a multi-host mycorrhiza) might have some advantage over trees which have to withstand as individuals,\u201d said Klein.

VLONDON | April 19: Global wind energy capacity will nearly double in the next five years, largely led by further market growth in China, but also as a stronger industry emerges in the United States, the Global Wind Energy Council GWEC ) said on Tuesday.In its annual report on the status of the global wind industry, GWEC said cumulative wind energy capacity was 433 gigawatts (GW) at the end of 2015, a 17 per cent rise from the year before.That should nearly double to around 792 GW by the end of 2020 as countries develop more renewable energy to comply with emissions cut targets, prices continue to fall and policies to support wind power in the United States stabilise, the wind industry association said in the report.Wind energy installed in 2015 reached 63 GW, a 22 per cent increase from the previous year. China alone installed nearly half of that new capacity -- 30.8 GW.In December last year in Paris, almost 200 countries agreed a landmark deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 with the aim of limiting global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius."The Paris Agreement requires a fully decarbonised power system by 2050 if not before, if we are keeping temperatures below 2 C above pre-industrial levels," Steve Sawyer, GWEC Secretary General, said in a statement.New markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America are also emerging which will be sources of growth in the next decade.Outside of China, the Asian market will be led by India but new markets in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Pakistan and Mongolia are also developing quickly, the report said.

VPARIS: As Europe and the United States brace for the likely arrival of the Zika virus from Latin America this summer, experts warn global warming may accelerate the spread of mosquito-borne disease.\u000a\u000aRising temperatures are a threat in more ways than one, they cautioned ahead of a major gathering of Zika researchers in Paris next week.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate change has contributed to the expansion of the range of mosquitoes,\u201d said Moritz Kraemer, an infectious diseases specialist at Oxford University.\u000a\u000aKraemer was the lead author of a study mapping the 2015 habitats of two warm-weather species -- both of which have gained ground in recent decades -- known to infect humans with several viruses. Since 2014, Aedes aegypti, known as the \u201cyellow fever\u201d mosquito, has been the main carrier of Zika across Brazil, Columbia and other parts of Latin America, where it has infected several million people, according to the World Health Organization.\u000a\u000aMost carriers of the virus show no symptoms. But Zika has also caused a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly, a devastating condition that shrivels foetal brains. It is also linked to a rare neurological disorder in adults.\u000a\u000aThe second species, Aedes albopictus, is similarly found along the world\u2019s tropical belt, but unlike aegypti has also colonised some 20 countries in southern Europe since the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aIn the northern hemisphere, mosquitoes are most active during summer months, disappearing every winter. In the warm, moist tropics, they thrive year-round.\u000a\u000aOver the last decade, the newly arrived albopictus has caused small outbreaks in southern Europe of dengue and chikungunya -- viral diseases that provoke high fever, headaches, muscular pain and, in rare cases, death.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHumans infecting mosquitoes\u000a\u000aLaboratory tests have shown that albopictus is also -- in the jargon of mosquito experts -- \u201ccompetent\u201d to carry Zika, and could drive its spread in Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe threat we are facing is that we will see the Zika virus in Europe next summer,\u201d said Anna-Bella Failloux, a virologist at the Institut Pasteur, which will co-host the April 25-26 meeting.\u000a\u000aAny outbreaks would likely remain localised, she said, but the fear of microcephaly looms large. In the southern United States, where aegypti is common, the threat is even more immediate.\u000a\u000aA virus can be introduced to a new region when a local mosquito picks it up from an infected human -- perhaps someone coming back, in the case of Zika, from a holiday in South America.\u000a\u000aIf it lives long enough, an infected female mosquito can then spread the virus while consuming the blood she needs to nourish her eggs. Here again, climate change could make things worse, experts say.\u000a\u000aIt can accelerate the virus\u2019 progression from the gut of the mosquito to its saliva -- a bit of which enters the human bloodstream as the insect draws a meal with its needle-like proboscis.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt warmer temperatures, this time period is shortened, leading to a greater likelihood that transmission will occur before the mosquito dies,\u201d said Lyle Petersen, an expert on vector-borne diseases at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado.\u000a\u000aHigher temperatures also shorten the time it takes for a mosquito egg to mature into a blood-sucking female.\u000a\u000aAt 28 degrees Celsius (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), this process happens within nine or 10 days, compared to about two weeks at 25 C (77 F). Viruses also tend to reproduce more quickly the warmer it gets.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGlobalisation of mosquitoes\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to the spread of mosquitoes and the viruses they carry, global warming is not the only -- or even the biggest -- driver, scientists point out.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is important, but increased international travel and trade -- globalisation, in short -- are even more important,\u201d said Herve Zeller, head of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\u2019s emerging and vector-borne disease programme. Ever larger numbers of travellers are at risk every day of being bitten by an diseased mosquito and taking the virus home with them while they are still infectious.\u000a\u000aPopulation density and access to clean water and living conditions are also key factors, and a major reason -- besides a more temperate climate -- that outbreaks in developing countries will continue to be more severe.\u000a\u000aMosquitoes flourish in bodies of stagnant water in densely-populated settlements typical to poor, urban communities.\u000a\u000aIn the absence of a vaccine or cure for Zika, the best way to prevent infection is to avoid getting bitten, experts say.\u000a\u000aPrevention efforts must focus on eliminating the insects and their breeding sites. -AFP\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VIn an earlier article I outlined a low carbon scenario for India that would ensure much lower levels of emissions and also import dependence than under a business-as-usual scenario. This would require us to take steps to reduce energy use in a number of sectors and also promote a shift to renewable energy. This article discusses some of the specific policies needed to achieve the low carbon outcome.\u000a\u000aEnergy pricing must support energy conservation\u000a\u000aEnergy prices are critical for promoting energy conservation because even if energy-efficient options exist, they will be adopted only if they are cost-effective. For example, improved pumps and foot valves in irrigation can save energy, but these pumps are more expensive, and farmers have little incentive to use them because electricity for agriculture is either free, or very heavily subsidized. It follows that if we want to promote energy conservation, we should avoid energy subsidies and set prices at a level that covers full economic costs.\u000a\u000aWithdrawal of subsidies may seem to hurt the poor, but this problem can be addressed by compensating those really in need through cash transfers. The Aadhaar platform, combined with financial inclusion, provides an effective mechanism for making the change. This approach could be applied to both kerosene and cooking gas, which are still subsidized by the central government. About half the kerosene ostensibly supplied for the poor actually leaks into the black market, and is used to adulterate diesel, damaging the engines into which it is fed and also increasing the pollution load.\u000a\u000aState governments also subsidize energy by underpricing electricity to farmers. This policy encourages excessive withdrawal of ground water, and has dangerously lowered the water table in Punjab and Haryana. States should be persuaded to introduce a programme to increase electricity tariffs for agriculture in a phased manner over a number of years, earmarking the resources saved for promoting water-saving irrigation methods and much-needed water conservation in rural areas. The central government could offer to match the funds mobilized through higher agricultural tariffs to expand watershed management programmes.\u000a\u000aTaxation to offset social costs of fossil fuels\u000a\u000aThe use of fossil fuels produces global warming and also local air pollution because of particulate matter released by thermal power stations and automobile exhausts. Since these costs are borne by society at large and not the energy user, there is a case for imposing taxes on the polluting activity.\u000a\u000aWith global warming, the social cost is borne by the world as a whole. This problem cannot be addressed by an individual country acting alone. What is needed is a global effort with all countries imposing a carbon tax at a globally calibrated rate. If all countries join, there will be no competitive disadvantage for any individual country. We should be willing to join a global pact on this issue.\u000a\u000aThe situation regarding air pollution caused by fossil fuels is very different. These costs are internal to a country and a tax on all fossil fuels (not just coal) is justified irrespective of whether other countries follow suit. The appropriate level of the tax depends upon the estimated social cost of air pollution. We currently have a clean energy tax on coal, but its level is quite low. Several international studies suggest that quite high tax rates could be justified on these grounds. The methodology underlying these studies should be carefully examined to come up with appropriate estimates for India and the implications for taxing different fossil fuels. This task could be assigned to NITI Aayog, which should also build in the quantification of the pollution impact in the energy calculator.\u000a\u000aAny proposal to impose taxes will meet with opposition. We need to explain that the purpose of these taxes is to discourage the use of polluting fuels. The resources mobilized by such a tax could, in principle, be returned to the community by lowering other taxes, but since there is a need to raise tax revenues to fund many socially desirable expenditures, it makes sense to use the revenues from the pollution tax for these, rather than lowering other taxes.\u000a\u000aPromoting energy efficiency in industry\u000a\u000aIndustry is the largest single user of energy and there is scope for increasing efficiency in energy use in industry. The Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) initiative, started in 2012, has shown the way. In the first phase of this initiative, from 2012 to 2015, targets were set for almost 500 industrial units requiring reductions of between 3% and 5% in energy consumption per unit of output. Those failing to meet the targets could purchase credits from units exceeding the target. In the first phase, the energy reduction achieved exceeded the target. The second phase has commenced in 2016, with expanded coverage and more demanding targets. As the world focuses on increasing energy efficiency, the scope for efficiency gains will increase. PAT must be constantly strengthened to ensure that Indian industry stays ahead of the curve.\u000a\u000aOne reason for energy inefficiency in Indian industry is the unreliability of grid power, which forces many smaller units to invest in captive electricity generation, which is much less energy-efficient than grid-based supply. Improvement in the functioning of the electricity sector making captive generation unnecessary will improve overall energy efficiency. This lies entirely in the domain of state governments.\u000a\u000aEnergy conservation in transport\u000a\u000aThe transport of passengers and freight is another area which offers potential energy savings. Improved logistics would help by rationalizing the movement of freight and removing inter-state barriers and check posts with long waiting times. The introduction of a well-designed goods and services tax would be a major benefit in this context.\u000a\u000aReversing the historical decline of the share of the railways in carrying freight will help increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution. A long-standing problem in this context is the distortion in the fare structure of the railways, with passenger fares kept very low and freight being overcharged to cover losses on the passenger side. High freight charges have, in turn, driven goods traffic increasingly to the roads. This problem has been emphasized repeatedly in Plan documents and committee reports, but no railway minister wants to face the ire of parliamentarians who seem wedded to keeping passenger fares low! The result has been falling internal resource generation, which limits the capacity of the railways to make the investments needed to improve the national transporter\u2019s carrying capacity. Investments also need to be supplemented by extensive reform of the institutional structure. The transformation brought about by China in the structure of its railways is a good example to follow.\u000a\u000aImpressive plans have been announced for expanding investment in the railways using borrowed funds and public-private partnerships. This is overdue, but its viability depends on being able to service the loans and, in the case of PPPs, to provide a return to investors. This will involve lowering freight charges to attract traffic away from road transport, and raising passenger fares to reduce losses in this segment. A Rail Tariff Regulatory Authority has been anno-unced, but has not yet been constituted.\u000a\u000aEnergy use in cities: buildings and urban transport\u000a\u000aWith growing urbanization, cities will account for a large part of total energy demand in the form of electricity used in buildings for lighting and other appliances, and petrol and diesel used for inner-city transport. There is huge scope for increased energy efficiency in both these areas.\u000a\u000aBuilding design standards, which are set by state governments and local bodies, must be revised to make the buildings more energy efficient and also enforced in practice. The central government on its part could announce that all new central government buildings will meet the highest green standards. A good step that would capture the public imagination would be to announce a programme for tearing down all the 60-year-old \u2018Bhavans\u2019 housing government offices on Rajpath, and replacing them with state-of-the-art green buildings, with rooftop solar electricity. This could be a multi-year project capturing the public imagination as an effort to establish this part of the nation\u2019s capital as a model of urban design and energy conservation.\u000a\u000aThere is a need to upgrade the statutory minimum energy efficiency requirements for all major appliances in line with the latest technological developments. These standards should be revised periodically to reflect new developments in these areas in the world. Simultaneously, there should be aggressive use of labelling to push consumers to greater energy efficiency.\u000a\u000aA great deal can be done to increase energy efficiency in urban transport through better land use planning to reduce the demand for transport and by encouraging a shift from private transport to public transport. These areas are entirely in the domain of state and local governments. Land use planning is obviously easier in new cities than in existing cities, but some improvements are possible even in existing cities through rezoning, and especially where substantial expansion is being planned.\u000a\u000aA shift to public transport is absolutely critical for achieving greater energy efficiency and reducing congestion and local pollution in our cities. Creating a good quality public transport system is a precondition for success and the initiative in this area lies entirely with state governments. Where a metro system exists or is planned, it should be integrated with the bus transport system to allow combined use by commuters. Electronically readable fare cards, which can be used in the metro system or in the bus system, will help achieve this objective.\u000a\u000aPositive measures to promote public transport will have to be accompanied by disincentives for the use of private vehicles. A pollution tax on petrol and diesel will help. An annual registration fee which is effectively an annual tax on car ownership would also help, as would the introduction of much higher parking charges. The resources realized from these taxes should be earmarked to support public transport.\u000a\u000aThere is a strong case in the major metros for declaring that from a fixed date in future, all new taxis, including three-wheelers, will have to be electric. Indian automobile manufacturers have the capacity to respond provided they are given a clear signal in advance that the change is inevitable. There should also be a provision for importing such vehicles at a reasonable duty to encourage domestic manufacturers to meet the demand. Electrification of vehicles is a key element in a climate change strategy not only because they are more energy-efficient and reduce local pollution, but also because the electricity will increasingly come from renewables, reducing total pollution.\u000a\u000aWe also need to upgrade the quality of automotive fuels to reduce the pollution effect in cities. This would require upgrading of the refineries and the additional cost of doing so may need to be recouped by an increase in fuel prices.\u000a\u000aPricing issues for renewable energy\u000a\u000aThe costs of solar energy have been falling and the latest bids for solar projects have produced solar tariffs that seem comparable to the price of conventional electricity supplied to the grid. However, the supply of solar and wind energy is intermittent, and induction of large-generation capacity from intermittent sources into the system is only possible if the distribution companies contract balancing capacity for the lean period or there is scope for storing the electricity produced during the peak period and using it in the lean period to deliver a pattern of supply which matches the demand profile. In both cases, additional costs have to be incurred. These will have to be passed on as higher electricity tariffs.\u000a\u000aTo summarize, a number of policy interventions are needed in different areas to combat climate change. Some are in the domain of the central government, while others are in the domain of state governments. Within each government, action often lies with different departments, each of which typically works in a silo, and achieving coordination across these different actors is often difficult. Fortunately, all that has to be done doesn\u2019t have to be done immediately. However, five years from now, when the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions are reviewed in the climate change negotiations, we should be in a position to show substantial progress in all these areas. For that, we need to start immediately to build public understanding about the need for these policies as part of the strategy to combat climate change.\u000a\u000aMontek Singh Ahluwalia is former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.

VThe EU's top today overturned free quotas for the bloc's carbon market up to 2030, a key part of strategies to curb global warming emissions.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission in Brussels was given 10 months to draw up new figures by the Luxembourg-based Euyropean of Justice.\u000a\u000aThe ruling came in a case brought by a number of companies including Esso and Dow against national authorities in Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.\u000a\u000a"The declares invalid the maximum annual amount of free allowances for greenhouse gas emissions determined by the Commission for the period 2013-2020," the court said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe court said the European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU that sets the quotas, had used figures given by some countries that should not have been included.\u000a\u000aThe EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's largest, puts a cap on carbon dioxide emitted by large factories and other companies.\u000a\u000aThe firms can trade in quotas of these emissions -- the idea being to provide a carrot to improve energy efficiency or switch to cleaner sources so that they keep within the ceiling.\u000a\u000aA large part of the quotas are free, partly to help European companies against international competitors.

VClimate change is exposing millions of workers to excessive heat, risking their health and income and threatening to erase more than USD 2.0 trillion in annual productivity by 2030, a UN report warned today.\u000a\u000aMore than one billion workers in countries hard-hit by global warming are already grappling with increasing severe heat, according to the report: "Climate Change and Labour: Impacts of Heat in the Workplace."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Already in the current situation, several percent of working hours can be lost in highly exposed regions," said the report, a collaboration between several UN agencies and international unions.\u000a\u000aThe global productivity loss is expected to top USD 2.0 trillion annually by 2030, as sweltering temperatures force outdoor workers and manual labourers to slow down, take longer breaks or even move to find work in a cooler climate.\u000a\u000a"When workers are put under these hot-house conditions, their capacity to work is dramatically impacted," Philip Jennings, head of UNI Global Union, told AFP.\u000a\u000aWorking in temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius is considered health hazardous.\u000a\u000aSome labourers exposed to such conditions have no choice but to continue working, sometimes without access to drinking water or shade to cool off in.\u000a\u000a"Those who work in the fields may ruin their health just by trying to put a meal on the table," Saleemul Huq, head of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, warned in a statement.\u000a\u000aAn estimated four billion people live in the areas most exposed to climate change.\u000a\u000aThose regions include much of southern Asia, the southern United States, Central America and the Caribbean, northern South America and north and west Africa.\u000a\u000aIn West Africa, the number of very hot days each year has already doubled since the 1960s, with an increase of around 10 additional hot days each decade, the report said.\u000a\u000aAnd in Kolkata, India, each decade brings an additional 12 days where the mercury soars above 29 C, it said.\u000a\u000aIndia has already lost around three percent of available daylight working hours annually due to extreme heat, and without dramatic action to rein in global warming could be looking at eight per cent respectively by 2085, the report showed.\u000a\u000aThe report comes after 160 nations last week signed a historic agreement reached in Paris aimed at keeping a rise in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

VKOLKATA: Burning more coal in Indian thermal power plants can have an adverse impact on rainfall locally. It could increase possibility of drought and the effects may travel across borders to the northern hemisphere, a new MIT study has indicated. \u201cIf this is indeed a fact, Asian thermal power generators, especially in India and China , will be under pressure to cut down thermal power generation and abandon new capacity addition plans,\u201d a senior analyst said.Benjamin S Grandey and Haiwen Cheng from the Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling, Singapore\u2013MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, have demonstrated that aerosol emissions in Asia may significantly impact the hydrological cycle, especially monsoon systems, affecting precipitation both locally and remotely in other parts of the world.Their study indicates that \u201cenergy and air quality policy in Asia, through consequent effects on aerosol emissions, can have important implications for future climatic changes both locally and globally.\u201d Despite global pressures to cut down coal usages in thermal power plants India has decided to increase coal production from a present level of 500 million tonnes to a billion tonnes in the next five years.\u201cHowever, if the effect of burning coal travels to other regions, the country could be made to cut down thermal power addition plans,\u201d the analyst cited above said. AK Ghosh, director at Society for Environment & Development said: \u201cVarious scientists have conducted various studies on the impact of burning coal on rainfall over the last fifty years. It has never been conclusively proven that burning coal can affect monsoon or increase possibilities of drought.\u201d\u201cHowever, burning coal leads to sulphur dioxide emissions which when mixed with rain water turns into sulphuric acid \u2014 something generally known as acid rain. Although acid rain is undesirable it is mostly confined to industrial areas and does not travel much,\u201d he said. An analyst specialising on power plants in India said increased release of greenhouse gas can lead to asymmetrical concentration of rainfall where there could be heavy bouts of rainfall in certain areas leading to drainage of excess water into rivers instead of being absorbed by ground to restore underground water levels. Nevertheless, coal producers in India pay a cess of Rs 400 for every tonne of coal they sell. This money is used for green projects.

VOn April 22, representatives from 175 countries >gathered in New York to affix their signatures on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was adopted by consensus by the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which met in December 2015.\u000a\u000aThe scene will now shift to obtaining enough instruments of ratification to bring the agreement into force before 2020, the first year of its proposed implementation. The agreement will enter into force with the ratification of at least 55 countries, whose aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions constitute at least 55 per cent of global emissions. One will need to watch what happens in the United States after the forthcoming presidential elections. There is a real risk that the Kyoto Protocol drama may be repeated with the U.S. Congress rejecting an agreement that the U.S. administration has signed. Were this to happen, other countries may withhold ratification since the U.S. is the second largest emitter of GHGs after China. India should not be in a hurry to ratify the Agreement until there is clarity on the U.S. position.\u000a\u000aStill a work in progress\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement represents only a skeletal framework which will now have to be fleshed out in post-Paris negotiations. Several major concepts and provisions were deliberately left ambiguous and open to differing interpretations in order to reach consensus. Further negotiations are necessary to reach a common understanding to enable implementation. For example, take the concept of \u201ctransparency\u201d. Developed countries claim that transparency requires a \u201ccommon and unified system\u201d to compare climate action undertaken as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by Parties. The Expert Review Teams (ERTs) under the UNFCCC currently evaluate the achievement of quantitative reductions in GHGs by developed countries only. There are demands that this should be modified to enable a common template to review national GHG emissions and removal (by carbon sinks) data for all countries after 2020. Developing countries, on the other hand, point to the \u201cflexibilities\u201d available to them in recognition of the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\u201d (the well-known CBDR principle) and insist that this should be reflected in the application of the transparency provision.\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement provides for a five-yearly \u201cstocktake\u201d which would enable an estimation of how much progress is being made in the implementation of the various contributions pledged by Parties in respect not only of mitigation but also adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building. How each of these contributions will be measured and evaluated still needs to be worked out. This will be both a political and technical challenge. Developed countries want to make the mitigation aspect specific and measurable while keeping other aspects such as finance and technology transfer to developing countries as indeterminate as possible so as not to be held accountable for what they have pledged in these areas. For example, the UNFCCC Secretariat has already opened what it calls a \u201cpublic registry\u201d for NDCs ahead of negotiations which may, by default, create a common reporting framework, pre-empting negotiations among Parties. Developing countries should question the rationale for such a registry ahead of a negotiated outcome on this issue.\u000a\u000aAt the insistence of the European Union, it was agreed at Paris that there would be a \u201cFacilitation Dialogue\u201d among Parties in 2018 focussed on the adequacy of aggregate NDCs with respect to the 2 Celsius global temperature limit and, even more ambitiously, the 1.5 Celsius limit favoured by the small island developing states. Such a review will inevitably and rightly come to the conclusion that the aggregate mitigation pledges made so far fall far short of the above temperature limits. There will be pressure on major emerging economies, including India, to take on more ambitious mitigation commitments since the developed economies, though major emitters, are progressively reducing their emissions while the developing countries are still on a rising though diminishing trajectory.\u000a\u000aIndia in the cross hairs\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince India, along with other developing countries, agreed to drop the key principle of \u201chistorical responsibility\u201d enshrined in the UNFCCC from the Paris Agreement, the responsibility of the developed industrialised countries for the largest proportion of GHG emissions accumulated in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and which is what is responsible for global warming, will be ignored in comparing mitigation contributions. Only current emissions will be the basis for this exercise. The principles of equity and CBDR are easier to operationalise with the acknowledgement of historical responsibility, for the simple reason that the responsibility of each country to the accumulated GHG stock is as measurable as are current emissions. Which country is occupying how much of the available carbon budget consistent with any specific temperature rise limit can be calculated with reasonable accuracy. These measures can be used to evaluate whether equity is being translated into practice in terms of climate actions by different Parties. With the concept of carbon budget out of the way, it is current emissions alone which will become the focus in the new climate change regime and create inevitable pressures on India for enhanced mitigation pledges \u2014 as we saw in Paris itself. India, for its energy security, will continue to rely on coal to generate power for its growing economy for the foreseeable future. This is already being projected as being contrary to the spirit of the Paris Agreement irrespective of the fact that several developed countries including the U.S. and Japan and among emerging economies, China, already use far more coal than India for their power generation. That is ignored because there is an incremental decline even though from a very high base in their case, while India is in the cross hairs because there is an incremental increase but from a much lower base. This, too, is a classic \u201cstock versus flow\u201d problem, where focussing only on the latter completely distorts the picture.\u000a\u000aBack-pedalling\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile trying to impose specific and onerous commitments on developing countries, the developed countries continue to evade providing any clarity on what they intend to contribute by way of finance, technology and capacity building to fulfil their Paris Agreement pledges. On finance there has been backsliding. There is a commitment, going back to the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, that $100 billion of finance a year will be available by 2020 to support climate action by developing countries. In Paris, it was agreed that no increase will be expected over this figure until 2025, five years into the implementation of the agreement. When the agreement talks of \u201cfinancial flows\u201d rather than public resources in the form of official transfers, it is not clear what would be the constituents of these flows and the value assigned to each.\u000a\u000aOn technology transfer, there is already an offensive by the U.S. corporate sector to ensure that in the post-Paris negotiations there is no concession on intellectual property (IP) issues. The U.S. lobby has objected to the UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines, which is considering how the IP issue may be dealt with, balancing the interests of different stakeholders to ensure equitable access to medicines, in particular for the poor and deprived. In a communication to the U.S. administration, these American companies have said that \u201csignificant challenges to IP remain in the Paris Agreement\u2019s implementation and subsequent negotiations \u2014 especially those related to the technology development and transfer chapter\u201d.\u000a\u000aIndia has already made substantial concessions to enable a consensus and successful outcome at Paris. Now it must ensure that it is not caught in a relentless attrition process where each concession becomes an argument for making the next one. The post-Paris negotiations will determine more precisely the shape of the climate change architecture for the next several decades. We must ensure that India\u2019s vital interests are safeguarded and the principle of equity and equitable burden-sharing is reflected across this architecture. There lies a long and hot summer ahead.\u000a\u000aShyam Saran is a former Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy for Climate Change (2006-09). He is currently Chairman, Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS), and Senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Research.

VBERLIN: Climate change may render parts of the Middle East and North Africa uninhabitable, forcing the residents to leave the region which is home to over 500 million people, a new study has warned.Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia have calculated that the Middle East and North Africa could become so hot that human habitability is compromised.The goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, agreed at the recent United Nations climate summit in Paris, will not be sufficient to prevent this scenario, researchers said.The temperature during summer in the already very hot Middle East and North Africa will increase more than two times faster compared to the average global warming, they said.This means that during hot days temperatures south of the Mediterranean will reach around 46 degrees Celsius by mid-century.Such extremely hot days will occur five times more often than was the case at the turn of the millennium. In combination with increasing air pollution by windblown desert dust, the environmental conditions could become intolerable and may force people to migrate, researchers said.More than 500 million people live in the Middle East and North Africa - a region which is very hot in summer and where climate change is already evident. The number of extremely hot days has doubled since 1970, they said."In future, the climate in large parts of the Middle East and North Africa could change in such a manner that the very existence of its inhabitants is in jeopardy," said Jos Lelieveld from Max Planck Institute.Researchers studied how temperatures will develop in the Middle East and North Africa over the course of the 21st century.The result is deeply alarming - even if Earth's temperature were to increase on average only by two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, the temperature in summer in these regions will increase more than two-fold, researchers said.By mid-century, during the warmest periods, temperatures will not fall below 30 degrees at night, and during daytime they could rise to 46 degrees Celsius, they said.By the end of the century, midday temperatures on hot days could even climb to 50 degrees Celsius, researchers said.Another finding was that heat waves could occur ten times more often than they do now.In addition, the duration of heat waves in North Africa and the Middle East will prolong dramatically, researchers said."If mankind continues to release carbon dioxide as it does now, people living in the Middle East and North Africa will have to expect about 200 unusually hot days, according to the model projections," said Panos Hadjinicolaou from Cyprus Institute.The findings were published in the journal Climatic Change.

VNEW DELHI: The World Bank 's Board has approved $625 million loan to support India's grid connected rooftop solar programme to generate clean energy.The Board also approved a co-financing loan of $120 million on concessional terms and a $5 million grant from Climate Investment Fund 's (CIF) Clean Technology Fund."The project will finance the installation of at least 400 MW of grid connected rooftop solar photovoltaic ( GRPV ) across India," the World Bank said in a statement.These solar PV installations, it said, will provide clean, renewable energy, and reduce GHG emissions by displacing thermal generation.The project will also strengthen the capacity of key institutions, and support the development of the overall solar PV market.It will be implemented by the State Bank of India , which will on-lend funds to solar PV developers/ aggregators and end-users, who wish to invest in mainly commercial and industrial rooftop PV systems.Financing will be provided to those with sound technical capacity, relevant experience, and creditworthiness as per SBI standards."India is endowed with huge solar energy potential, and the World Bank is strongly supportive of the government's plans to harness this potential and increase India's solar PV capacity to 100 GW."This project will support this target, by providing financing to some of the 40 GW of solar PV which will be placed on rooftops," said Onno Ruhl, World Bank Country Director in India.Aided by government policy and declining costs, rooftop solar has the potential to transform the energy sector. The overall potential demand for rooftop solar is estimated at about 124,000 MW, the release said.The loan, from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 19.5 year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years. Loan from CIF's Clean Technology Fund, has a 10 year grace period, and a maturity of 40 years.The IBRD-CIF loan will support a number of solar PV business models, to expand the reach of rooftop PV systems to a variety of customer groups.Accordingly, the range of options available to investors under the SBI Rooftop PV Program will include third-party ownership, leasing, rooftop rental, as well as direct end-user ownership.

VNearly half the world\u2019s population lives near coasts. As climate change exacerbates the effects of storms, flooding and erosion, the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of those people will be at risk. In fact, the latest edition of the World Economic Forum\u2019s World Risk Assessment Report names failure to adapt to the effects of climate change as the single greatest risk, in terms of impact, to societies and economies around the world.\u000a\u000aBeyond endangering lives, more frequent and stronger storms could cost many billions of dollars, owing to infrastructure damage and lost revenues from farming, fisheries and tourism. Yet, the international community currently spends on risk mitigation less than one-fifth of what it spends on natural-disaster response.\u000a\u000aWith the human and the financial costs of climate change attracting more attention than ever, now is the time to shift resources towards risk reduction. Doing so will require national governments, industry, aid organizations and other NGOs to make the most of their investments. And some of the most effective and cost-effective solutions are already available in nature.\u000a\u000aCoastal and marine ecosystems have considerable potential to mitigate the effects of storms and other risks, especially when combined with traditional built infrastructure. A 100m belt of mangroves, for example, can reduce wave height by up to 66% and lower peak water levels during floods. A healthy coral reef can reduce wave force by 97%, lessening the impact of storms and preventing erosion. These and other coastal ecosystems are the first line of defence for many cities around the world, from Miami to Manila.\u000a\u000aUntil recently, such nature-based solutions were too often overlooked. But the Paris climate agreement, reached last December, not only established a consensus on the importance of addressing climate change, but also explicitly affirmed that ecosystems play a role in capturing greenhouse gases and helping communities adapt to the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aAt the national level, some of the most at-risk island countries are taking important steps. For example, last year, the Seychelles announced a first-of-its-kind \u201cdebt for nature\u201d swap with its Paris Club creditors and The Nature Conservancy. The swap will allow the country to redirect $21.6 million of its debt towards investment in a comprehensive approach to ocean conservation that will bolster its resilience to climate change.\u000a\u000aPrivate-sector leaders, too, are starting to look towards natural tools. Engineering firms like CH2M are working with coastal communities in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond to find hybrid solutions that combine traditional approaches.\u000a\u000aNature can also help to protect livelihoods. A Red Cross-led mangrove restoration project in Vietnam not only reduced damage to dykes and other built infrastructure, but also resulted in higher aquaculture yields and thus more income for the local communities. A mangrove and coral restoration project in Grenada\u2014a joint effort of the Red Cross, the Nature Conservancy and the fishers of Grenada\u2019s Grenville community\u2014has also shown great potential to increase resilience. Just 30m of reef and coral have been shown to increase substantially the population of lobster, conch, octopus and urchins.\u000a\u000aIn the face of rising climate and disaster risk, investments in nature-based solutions can protect lives and safeguard prosperity in a cost-effective manner\u2014all while preserving imperiled natural ecosystems around the world. It is time for governments, business and NGOs alike to recognize that when it comes to fighting the effects of climate change and protecting coastal communities, preserving and restoring nature may be the smartest investment we can make.\u000a\u000a2016/PROJECT SYNDICATE\u000a\u000aMaria Damanaki is global managing director for Oceans at the Nature Conservancy.\u000a\u000aComments are welcome at otherviews@livemint.com

VAustralian scientists said in March just seven percent of the entire Great Barrier Reef had avoided any damage as a result of bleaching, and they held grave fears particularly for coral on the northern reef. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aMass bleaching has destroyed as much as 35 percent of the coral on the northern and central Great Barrier Reef, Australian scientists said on Monday, a major blow to the World Heritage Site that attracts about A$5 billion ($3.59 billion) in tourism each year.\u000a\u000aAustralian scientists said in March just seven percent of the entire Great Barrier Reef had avoided any damage as a result of bleaching, and they held grave fears particularly for coral on the northern reef.\u000a\u000aAfter further aerial surveys and dives to access the damage across 84 reefs in the region, Australian scientists said the impact of the bleaching is more severe than they had expected.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis year is the third time in 18 years that the Great Barrier Reef has experienced mass bleaching due to global warming, and the current event is much more extreme than we\u2019ve measured before,\u201d said professor Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University.\u000a\u000aBleaching occurs when the water is too warm, forcing coral to expel living algae and causing it to calcify and turn white. Mildly bleached coral can recover if the temperature drops, otherwise it may die.\u000a\u000aAlthough the impact has been exacerbated by one of the strongest El Nino weather systems in nearly 20 years, which recently subsided, scientists believe climate change is the underlying cause.\u000a\u000aThe survey findings come just days after Australia\u2019s Department of Environment confirmed it omitted its contribution to a U.N. report examining the impact of climate change on world heritage sites over concerns it could create \u201cconfusion\u201d and have a negative impact on tourism.\u000a\u000aThe World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report, which was released on Friday with no references to Australia, has sparked outrage from climate scientists, who were not informed that their contributions had been removed.\u000a\u000aUNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee last May stopped short of placing the Great Barrier Reef on an \u201cin danger\u201d list, but the ruling raised concern about its future.\u000a\u000aAustralia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants for electricity.\u000a\u000aDespite pledging to cut carbon emissions, Australia has continued to support fossil fuel projects, including Adani Enterprises Ltd\u2019s proposed A$10 billion Carmichael coal project in the Galilee Basin in western Queensland.

VThe success of a global renewable energy project on Ecuador's Galapagos archipelago has given a major boost to the idea of sustainable development, according to a report.\u000a\u000aMeeting 30 percent of local energy needs, the $10 million San Cristbal Wind Project reduced the archipelago's greenhouse gas emissions and preserved critically endangered species, said a report released recently by the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership (GSEP).\u000a\u000aGSEP is a not-for-profit association of 11 of the world's foremost electricity firms.\u000a\u000aThe association said the initiative has displaced 8.7 million litres of diesel fuel and avoided 21,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\u000a\u000aThe project's three 51-metre-tall wind turbines and two sets of solar panels have supplied, on an average, 30 percent of the electricity consumed on San Cristbal -- the archipelago's second-largest island in size and population -- since it went into operation in October 2007.\u000a\u000aGSEP has recommended the project's expansion to further boost the renewable energy share to 70 percent.\u000a\u000aThe Galapagos, an archipelago of 19 islands in the Pacific Ocean 1,000 km off the coast of Ecuador, is home to an array of unique, exotic plant and animal species and famed as the site of Charles Darwin's research of the evolution of species by natural selection.\u000a\u000aAlthough most islands are uninhabited and protected from development, a few have growing populations, economically supported by thriving tourism, which is capped at 200,000 annual visitors.\u000a\u000aSan Cristbal, site of the provincial capital, is among the busiest islands with a bustling port and airport.\u000a\u000aFor decades, all of San Cristbal's electricity came from diesel-fuelled power generating stations. But in January 2001, an oil spill threatened to destroy the irreplaceable heritage of plants, birds and marine life.\u000a\u000aThis led the government of Ecuador, the UN Development Programme and the GSEP to come together to start the public-private partnership project.\u000a\u000aEach of the three turbines, designed to operate at a very low wind speed, has a capacity of 800 kilowatts. Over the first eight years, they have functioned a remarkable 92 percent of the time, and produced more than 26 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.\u000a\u000aThe project is eligible to participate in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), created under the Kyoto Protocol climate change treaty.\u000a\u000aThe CDM set up a market for Certified Emission Reduction certificates (CERs), each equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions, which can be sold by countries that are below their emission targets to those that exceed them.\u000a\u000aThe project sold 11,000 CERs, for a total of $110,000, during its first four years, but because of low prices it has not participated in the market since then.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000avr/pgh/dg

VNew Delhi: India on Wednesday unveiled a blueprint to tackle national disasters through its first ever National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP). The plan, released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to make the country disaster resilient and reduce loss of lives and assets during calamities.\u000a\u000aThe NDMP provides a framework to deal with all phases of disaster management cycle\u2014prevention, mitigation, response and recovery\u2014and lays down duties of various government departments at all levels such as centre, state, district and panchayat.\u000a\u000aThe plan outlines 15 disasters, and has entrusted various ministries for its management and mitigation.\u000a\u000aFor instance, in case of tsunami or cyclone, the ministry of earth sciences would be responsible for disaster management and similarly for landslides, it will be the job of the ministry of mines. Health ministry will take care of biological disasters and urban development ministry will deal with urban floods.\u000a\u000aIt identifies 18 broad activities to be served as a ready reckoner. These include early warning, maps, satellite inputs, information dissemination, evacuation of people and animals, medical care, drinking water and essential supplies like food, communication, power, fuel, transportation, disposal of animal carcasses, relief employment, and data collection and management.\u000a\u000aThe NDMP also calls for addressing the increased disaster risks from the adverse impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aLt Gen N.C. Marwah, (retired), member of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and one of the authors of the plan, said, \u201cThe plan has been evolved over a period of time so it encompasses all aspects and dimensions of disaster management. The most important part of the plan is the horizontal and vertical matrices that we have worked out which clearly states who has to do what right from panchayat or local body to district, state level and centre.\u201d He added that the real challenge would be to ensure its implementation and monitoring.\u000a\u000aWith the plan, India has joined the list of nations that follow the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, endorsed by the United Nations in 2015. It was the first major agreement post 2015 development agenda with seven targets and four priorities for action signed by 187 countries, including India.\u000a\u000aThe plan would also become a key highlight for the Asian ministers meet to be held in Delhi in November where a disaster plan for Asian region would be discussed, said an NDMA official.\u000a\u000aThe NDMP also identifies short, medium and long term measures to deal with disasters to be completed within five, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Besides humans, it also suggests ways to protect animals. For instance, it stressed that, \u201cagencies specializing in animal care should provide necessary advisory and support for the care and protection of animals\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn cold wave conditions, animal and livestock owners must feed adequately with appropriate feed to avoid animal deaths. They must stock suitable feed or forage before cold wave to feed the livestock. They must avoid exposure of animals to extreme cold,\u201d it added.\u000a\u000aThe plan also focuses on human-induced disasters.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe human-induced category includes CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) disasters. Besides, with the natural factors discussed earlier, various human induced activities are also responsible for accelerated impact and increase in frequency of disasters in the country. The NDMP covers disaster management cycle for all types of hazards faced in India, both natural and human-induced,\u201d the plan said.

VClimate change poses not just an ecological, but also a fiscal burden on EMEs\u2014with their GDP projected to be 6% lower than it would ordinarily be by 2100. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aClimate change is real, and the need to acknowledge and jointly combat the clear and present danger our planet faces is critical. According to the book The World in 2050\u2014which underlines scenarios from various research articles on climate change, pollution, trade and GDP on how the world would look like in a few decades from now\u2014if unmonitored, the earth could be 4.9C warmer in 2100 than it was in 1900. Such a rise in temperature could turn New Delhi into a desert, melt Himalayan glaciers and trigger a Third World War for remaining resources.\u000a\u000aOur over-reliance on fossil fuels could cause sea levels to rise by 0.5 metres, submerging even large coastal cities such as Mumbai, and could lead to hurricanes destroying life in the littoral regions. The agriculture sector could face declines of over 15% in crop yields, and food security worldwide could be threatened.\u000a\u000aGlobally\u2014especially in poverty-stricken developing and underdeveloped nations\u2014human health could deteriorate, with the population facing higher risks of catching diseases that have been aggravated by the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe havoc-wreaking emissions are significantly contributed by the rapid economic and population growth of emerging market economies (EMEs) such as our own; in 2011, India emitted 1.7 metric tonnes per capita of CO2.\u000a\u000aClimate change poses not just an ecological, but also a fiscal burden on EMEs\u2014with their GDP projected to be 6% lower than it would ordinarily be by 2100.\u000a\u000aGlobal organisations have set targets to combat climate change, like the 2C target set in the UN Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009, establishing the need to reduce carbon emissions by 40-70% by 2050, and reach zero emissions by 2100. Bodies like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OECD have adopted varying strategies to meet these targets: IEA\u2019s preferred approach is the INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) Scenario which assesses action that needs to be taken after all countries meet their pledges, and also acknowledges a Bridge Scenario for adoption of near-term strategies. The OECD relies on the 450 Scenario, further analysed in terms of Core, Accelerated and Delayed possibilities. 450 Core begins in 2013, and aims at reducing greenhouse gas contribution by 450 parts per million of CO2 (450 ppm CO2e) by 2100. Similarly, 450 Accelerated seeks additional mitigation efforts until 2030, and 450 Delayed calls for action only post 2020.\u000a\u000aHowever, as the book highlights, postponed efforts come at a price\u2014an early transition could cost 25-33% less than delayed actions. Had EMEs started acting in 2012 to reduce CO2 emissions to 2005 levels by 2050, a 0.4% per annum reduction would be required, as compared to the 1.5% needed if they begin in 2030 to meet the same target by 2070.\u000a\u000aIf undertaken in time, these globally implemented precautionary endeavours will serve as an insurance against the inevitable advent of the planet\u2019s biggest rival: climate change.

VCompetitiveness is encouraging companies to stay ahead of the environmental compliance curve and go green, Nitin Desai, Member, Prime Minister\u2019s Council on Climate Change, said.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at the inaugural session of CII GreenCo Summit 2016, Nitin Desai highlighted companies that lead are those who anticipate the future instead of reacting to regulatory requirements.\u000a\u000aDesai said green consumers, green finance and green governance should come together with green manufacturing, for environmental actions to have a greater impact. He cited the uptake of LED lights in India as an example of all four of these factors coming together.\u000a\u000aJamshyd N Godrej, Chairman, CII Godrej GBC, said there is no conflict between environment and economic development. Companies should be open and more transparent on their environmental process to their stakeholders.\u000a\u000aHe said CII aspires to facilitate 1,000 GreenCo rated companies by 2020.\u000a\u000aPradeep Bhargava, Chairman, GreenCo Summit 2016, called on the need to not just consider payback but also think of \u201cpayfront\u201d and work towards becoming green and enable reductions in the price of environmentally friendly products.\u000a\u000aHe said CII GreenCo rating system is evoking excellent response. Over 200 companies are working on the rating and this includes 78 GreenCo rated companies. Each GreenCo rated company saves about Rs 2 crore per year.\u000a\u000aIt is inspiring to witness that SME companies are going the green way, he said. Out of the 30 companies who were awarded with GreenCo rating at the inaugural session, three companies were from SMEs sector.\u000a\u000aMoUs\u000a\u000aOne memorandum of understanding was inked between Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd (TSIIC) and CII and another between Jawaharlal Nehru Pharma City, Andhra Pradesh and CII.\u000a\u000aThese MoUs aim at fostering \u2018Eco-Industrial Parks\u2019.

VHOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp asked a federal court on Wednesday to throw out a subpoena that would force the oil company to hand over decades of documents as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into whether it misled investors about climate change risks.\u000a\u000aA sign is seen at the entrance of the Exxonmobil Port Allen Lubricants Plant in Port Allen, Louisiana, November 6, 2015. REUTERS/Lee Celano\u000a\u000aIn its filing in a U.S. district court, Exxon said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey overreached with her April subpoena and that it violated constitutional amendments on free speech, unreasonable search and seizure and equal protection.\u000a\u000aThe Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office said it was reviewing the motion.\u000a\u000aThe move by the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil company is the latest in its high-stakes battle with a coalition of state attorneys general who said in March they would go after Exxon and try to force Congress to tackle climate change.\u000a\u000aExxon also pushed back against a raft of shareholder proposals last month asking it to show how it will react to the Paris agreement among 195 governments that aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) by curbing carbon emissions from fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aThe subpoena from Healey comes amid claims by prosecutors that Exxon executives contradicted papers published by company scientists about the threats of climate change. The subpoena also seeks any Exxon communications with free-market business groups that doubt the efficacy of clamping down on emissions or climate science itself.\u000a\u000aExxon said in its filing the subpoena seeks documents outside of the statute of limitations and that activist groups encouraged opening inquiries.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe great irony here is that we\u2019ve acknowledged the risks of climate change for more than a decade, have supported a carbon tax as the better policy option and spent more than $7 billion on research and technologies to reduce emissions,\u201d said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. \u201cIt should make people question what this is really all about.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe attorneys general have based their inquiries on whether Exxon\u2019s alleged soft-pedaling of climate risks or carbon regulation amounted to securities fraud.\u000a\u000aIn the past, current or former Exxon chief executives have said climate models are not entirely perfect, that curbing emissions could condemn the world\u2019s poor to darkness, and that humans may need to adapt to changing weather and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aAt a seminar in May on climate change law, Columbia Law School professor Merritt B. Fox said Exxon\u2019s comments might not be material for investors.\u000a\u000aThat is because investors get information on climate change from many sources and Exxon would probably not be able to alter the \u201ctotal mix\u201d of publicly available information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe market was well supplied with information about climate change from a variety of sources,\u201d said Fox, who acknowledged the importance of climate change but expressed skepticism about the legal strategy of prosecutors.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, five Republican congressmen told U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a letter the states\u2019 inquiries were wrongly treating a policy issue as a law enforcement matter.\u000a\u000aThe case is 4:16-cv-00469-A in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division.\u000a\u000aReporting by Terry Wade; Editing by Tom Brown and Meredith Mazzilli

VBut a new \u201cclimate-smart lending platform\u201d aims to make credit easier and cheaper to access for farmers working to protect their crops, while helping lenders find customers who are a lower credit risk because their harvests are less vulnerable to extreme weather. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aAs small-scale farmers around the world seek to cope with climate change by adopting drought-resistant crops or methods to capture and store water, finding the money can be a problem, and interest rates on loans are often high.\u000a\u000aBut a new \u201cclimate-smart lending platform\u201d aims to make credit easier and cheaper to access for farmers working to protect their crops, while helping lenders find customers who are a lower credit risk because their harvests are less vulnerable to extreme weather.\u000a\u000aThe platform, targeting 450 million small-scale farmers around the world, is one of four new projects that have won the backing of the UK-based climate action which hopes to channel enough cash, fast, to meet the global goals to curb climate change set last December in Paris.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to make sure we are moving from thought to action after the Paris agreement, that we are getting new projects off the ground,\u201d said Barbara Buchner, director of the innovation lab and a senior director of the Climate Policy Initiative.\u000a\u000aThe lab\u2019s goal, she said, is to identify innovative ways to leverage the limited amount of government funding available, in order to lower risks and smooth obstacles for private investors, who have the cash to make action on climate change happen at the huge scale needed.\u000a\u000aThat might be through insurance to guarantee cost savings from energy efficiency investments, for instance, or government-guaranteed bonds to support construction of water security infrastructure.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe goal over time is not to require public investment any more, to make things sustainable,\u201d Buchner said.\u000a\u000aThe innovation lab has so far mobilised close to $600 million in seed money for initiatives from its backers, which include the British, Danish, Dutch, German and U.S. governments, as well as banks, foundations and other investors.\u000a\u000aENERGY SAVINGS\u000a\u000aJane Wilkinson, a director of the Climate Policy Initiative with a background of working in Indonesia, said that for most private investors, \u201cvarious forms of risk \u2013 perceived or real \u2013 are the biggest barriers\u201d to investment.\u000a\u000aIn Mexico, for instance, persuading companies or government bodies to spend money on improving energy efficiency \u2013 a crucial way to cut climate-changing emissions \u2013 can be a challenge, both because it\u2019s often not a priority and because they are unsure just how much they could save by doing it, she said.\u000a\u000aBut an \u201cenergy efficiency enabling initiative\u201d, piloted in Mexico by the Inter-American Development Bank, uses small amounts of cash to buy insurance for those investing in energy efficiency. If the project works, they spend less on energy; if it doesn\u2019t, they get an insurance payout, Wilkinson said.\u000a\u000aAnalysis of the scheme, one of those backed by the lab, suggests each $100 million spent on insurance should generate between $3 billion and $9 billion in energy efficiency improvements.\u000a\u000aWilkinson said the Mexico project is now set to be replicated in El Salvador with the backing of the Green Climate Fund, which is expected to channel much of a promised $100 billion a year in cash to help poorer countries curb their emissions and deal with climate impacts.\u000a\u000aSMARTER INSURANCE\u000a\u000aKenya, meanwhile, is driving private investment into water facilities by guaranteeing bonds issued to pay for the projects, which \u201cmakes them a very secure investment\u201d, Wilkinson said.\u000a\u000aAn innovation lab analysis found that expanding government backing for such green bonds in other developing countries could drive $1.2 billion a year in private investment into climate-resilient water projects through 2030.\u000a\u000aAnother project aims to boost take-up of property insurance in Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines by enabling companies, governments and other potential buyers to better understand the risks they face through modelling and access to good data.\u000a\u000aExpanding the number of people who are insured against worsening losses from storms, drought, floods and other climate-related disasters could reduce the estimated $180 billion in annual losses around the world from natural disasters.\u000a\u000aIt could also encourage investment in climate adaptation to lower disaster risks and make policies cheaper, Wilkinson said.\u000a\u000aMost private investment to deal with climate change has gone into clean energy or other technologies to cut emissions so far.\u000a\u000aMeasures to adapt to climate change \u2013 such as installing early warning systems or water storage \u2013 rarely offer a clear return on investment, a major reason relatively little private money has flowed to them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to incentivise people to come in at scale to invest in adaptation or resilience,\u201d Buchner said. That will require the creation of \u201cviable business models\u201d, she added.

Vis planning to set up in the state. A senior official from the state said that conceptualisation process is under way.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on the sidelines of Green Power 2016, organised by in Chennai, Jagmohan Singh Raju, chairman and managing director, Energy Development Agency (TEDA) said: "We have already initiated the process. We are looking at what can be linked to green energy; for example, agriculture, street lights, housing, appliances - something like solar television sets."\u000a\u000aThe conceptualisation process is under way and is expected to be ready in about a month's time.\u000a\u000awill undertake a demo project first to explore the feasibility and utility of the project, post which the project would be replicated either through the government or in partnership with stakeholders.\u000a\u000aInitially, the project could be implemented in tribal and remote areas and would then be expanded to other regions, said Raju.\u000a\u000aP Thangamani, Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise, said that has developed a vision to become a global leader in renewable energy. With several states facing severe energy shortage, Tamil Nadu is one of the few states with surplus power.\u000a\u000aHe was speaking at the 15th edition of \u2014\u000a\u000aThangamani said that in the next three years, around 3,000 MW of power will be produced through solar rooftops.\u000a\u000aThis would considerably reduce energy demand from coal-powered thermal plants and reduce carbon emissions. This initiative would also power 3 lakh households, aiding rural electrification project of Tamil Nadu.\u000a\u000aRaju added the Tamil Nadu government will facilitate business-friendly polices to promote technology in a big way in the renewable energy sector with inputs from the industry. Through its solar policy of 2012, the state government has been promoting power generation by both the large investors and small households. Tamil Nadu is a welfare state which promotes "equity in growth and inclusiveness in development''.\u000a\u000awould also be focusing on skill development and create initially a 'Green Army' of 5,000 technicians in different parts of the state.

VThe World Bank said on Thursday it would lend India more than $1 billion for its huge solar energy programme, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought climate change funds from its visiting head.\u000a\u000aModi is banking on India\u2019s 300 days a year of sunshine to generate power and help fight climate change rather than committing to emission cuts like China.\u000a\u000aThe World Bank loan is the global lender\u2019s biggest solar aid for any country and comes as India has set a goal of raising its solar capacity nearly 30 times to 100 gigawatts by 2020 and is attracting mega investment proposals from top companies and institutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrime Minister Modi\u2019s personal commitment toward renewable energy, particularly solar, is the driving force behind these investments,\u201d World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement released after he met Modi. \u201cThe World Bank Group will do all it can to help India meet its ambitious targets, especially around scaling up solar energy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia is the largest client of the World Bank, which lent it around $4.8 billion between 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aModi\u2019s office said he told Kim about the need for climate change financing for countries like India that are \u201cconsciously choosing to follow an environmentally sustainable path\u201d.\u000a\u000aIndia wants the share of non-fossil fuel in total installed power capacity to jump to 40 percent by 2030 from 30 percent currently, but there are challenges including weak finances of state distribution companies forced to sell subsidised power, difficulties hooking up solar projects to grids, and access to affordable capital.\u000a\u000aStill India reckons its renewable energy industry could generate business opportunities worth $160 billion this decade, making it a lucrative market that has already attracted big global players such as Japan\u2019s Softbank Corp, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, First Solar, Trina Solar Ltd and Finland\u2019s state-controlled utility Fortum Oyj.\u000a\u000aGerman development bank KFW has already agreed to offer India low-interest loans of around 1 billion euro over the next five years to fund roof-mounted solar panels, and the construction of solar energy farms and self-contained solar power facilities not connected to the grid.

VNew Delhi: Each year as temperatures rise across India, farmers look to the sky and pray for rain.\u000a\u000aThe all-important monsoon forecast becomes a national priority, with more than 70% of India\u2019s 1.25 billion citizens engaged in agriculture and relying on weather predictions to decide when they will sow their seeds and harvest their crops.\u000a\u000aBut getting the forecast right remains a challenge, thanks to the complex \u2014 and still poorly understood \u2014 ways in which South Asia\u2019s monsoon rains are influenced by everything from atmospheric and ocean temperatures to air quality and global climate trends. Even the amount of ice in Antarctica is suspected to have an impact.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s only getting harder to figure out, scientists say, as the monsoon becomes increasingly erratic.\u000a\u000aA new study released Friday in the journal Science Advances helps clear up a bit of the mystery, by showing that man-made climate change is responsible for most of the change seen in ocean surface temperatures near the equator across Asia, which in turn affect regional rainfall patterns including the Indian monsoon.\u000a\u000aBy showing that link, the study indicates future ocean warming in the region, which could in turn increase the amount of rainfall during monsoons, strengthen cyclones and increase precipitation over East Asia.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis has important implications for understanding changes in rainfall patterns for a large, and vulnerable population across Asia,\u201d said oceanographer Evan Weller, who led the research team while he was at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, before recently shifting to Monash University in Australia.\u000a\u000aThe study looks specifically at a mid-oceanic body called the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, which holds some of the world\u2019s warmest seawaters and spans the western Pacific to the eastern Indian Ocean.\u000a\u000aScientists have long known that India\u2019s monsoons are partly influenced by that warm pool. And they\u2019ve known that the pool has been expanding \u2014 and warming \u2014 for decades. That expansion and warming have already caused some sea rise around islands in Asia.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t entirely clear why the pool was changing, until now.\u000a\u000aWeller and his team compared data observations with several climate models, and deduced that rising greenhouse gases along with aerosols and other atmospheric pollutants were the dominant cause of the pool\u2019s warming and expansion over the past 60 years, though regional climate variations also had some effect.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis wasn\u2019t entirely surprising. We\u2019ve long suspected climate change to be behind the changes, but no one had yet proven it,\u201d Weller said. What they didn\u2019t expect was to find that the western portion of the pool, near India, was expanding more than the eastern part in the Pacific. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know why. We\u2019ll try to figure that out next.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut one thing is clear: If climate change trends continue, and by most indications they will, forecasters will have to consider the warm pool in their monsoon predictions. And by demonstrating how greenhouse gases are the dominant driver of changes in the warm pool, the team has added another dimension that can help improve climate models.\u000a\u000aAsia, in general, could face significant consequences from this trend: more storm activity over East Asia, and stronger South Asian monsoons between June and September.\u000a\u000aThat sounds like good news for water-scarce India, but probably isn\u2019t. Most of that rain would likely fall before the monsoon front reaches land. Already, studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology show a declining trend in precipitation over land.\u000a\u000aStill, climate modelling is complex, and models still have their biases and limitations. Focusing so specifically on the warm pool may obscure the larger picture, some suggested, especially in the Pacific where there are many other factors at play.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy only concern is that treating the western Pacific warm pool in isolation provides very limited insight,\u201d said climatologist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. He was not involved in the study. \u201cOne has to view it as part of the larger tropical Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the dynamics of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, and how they may change in a changing climate.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnxious to improve its forecasting, India is investing at least $43 million through 2017 to buy more powerful computers and better technology that can help specialists make more accurate calculations and models of seasonal weather forecasts. Meanwhile, researchers from across the world are launching one study after another to better understand the many dynamics involved.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is not so easy to predict the monsoon,\u201d said meteorologist B.P. Yadav, a spokesman for the Indian Meteorological Department. \u201cThere is variability from region to region, time to time, and then the rains move in different stages across the land.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndian meteorologists had announced this year\u2019s monsoon would be normal, only to watch the rains make landfall a week late in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and then stall repeatedly on their month-long progression north. At one point, officials urged farmers to wait to sow until they actually saw the raindrops falling from the sky.\u000a\u000aBut on Friday, when the monsoon was scheduled to hit New Delhi, the sky turned ochre and millions in the long-sweltering Indian capital delighted in the on-time relief of rain.

VCall it the audacity of ambition. After the country\u2019s solar power capacity doubled to almost 7gw in 18 months, some within the government think it\u2019s time for an upward revision of the goal of 100gw by 2022. Such ambition has been central to changing the perception about India\u2019s willingness to contribute to the global effort to reduce carbon pollution \u201cIndia is an interesting and inspiring example. The ambition is amazing,\u201d says Adnan Amin, director general, International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ), the Abu Dhabi-based intergovernmental body promoting renewable energy.It is difficult not be dazzled by India\u2019s renewable energy ambition. In 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 100gw target, India had 3gw of solar energy and 33.8gw of renewable energy capacity. The government did not stop there. In January 2015, it upped the 2022 target to 175gw of renewable energy (RE) capacity, including wind and biomass.Then in October 2015, India pledged \u2014 as part of the Paris Agreement, the UN-sponsored global effort to tackle climate change \u2014 that by 2030, non-fossil fuels would account for 40% of the total energy generation capacity. This, according to officials involved in drawing up the plan, translates to almost 300gw of RE capacity. IRENA estimates that by 2030, India\u2019s solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment would be about 209gw.Can India pull it off? While the targets appear daunting, the increased pace of capacity addition shows the government\u2019s serious intent. India\u2019s RE capacity has gone from 33.8gw to 43gw, overtaking hydroelectric capacity. \u201cUnlike before, there is political support for the renewable energy programme at the highest level \u2014 the Prime Minister\u2019s Office is directly supporting it,\u201d said a senior energy sector official.Still, India will need to step up the pace\u2014something in the neighbourhood of an average of 20gw+ annually. Translating the government\u2019s \u201cbold, ambitious, ambitious\u201d RE targets does present some challenges. Accessing affordable finance, the poor financial health of state electricity distribution companies and technological challenges \u2014 be it grid stability or storage \u2014 are at the top of the list.Energy minister Piyush Goyal is sure that the 175gw target will be met. \u201cIndia is moving rapidly towards realising the clean energy vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\u201d Goyal said earlier this year on the micro-blogging site Twitter. Bolstered by the progress, in May, Goyal said that he was considering an upward revision for 2022 solar target.Goyal has cause to be optimistic. Renewable energy tariffs have hit record lows\u2014an all-time low price of Rs 4.34/unit was achieved for solar energy capacity in January. Goyal says that solar tariffs are becoming competitive in relation to thermal power costs. Increased interest in India is another factor underlying Goyal\u2019s optimism.REN21, the global renewable energy multi-stakeholder network, in its 2016 Global Status Report listed India among the top five countries for investment in renewable power and fuels in 2015, behind China, the US, Japan and the UK. Consulting firm KPMG estimated in the November 2015 edition of The Rising Sun that in energy terms the market penetration of solar power could be 5.7% (54gw) in 2020 and 12.5% (166gw) in 2025.\u201d Such optimism is not sufficient to achieve the goals.\u201cTo make good on these targets, we need to surmount the twin challenge of finance and technology,\u201d says Ajay Mathur, director general of the Delhi-based think tank Teri, who, till the beginning of the year, headed the government\u2019s Bureau of Energy Efficiency.The total investment required to make good on the promise of 100gw solar energy capacity is estimated at about Rs 600,000 crore or almost $100 billion. The government\u2019s outlay for the 12th Plan period is Rs 13,690 crore, barely a fraction of the required investment. A boost of Rs 10,000 crore in the 2016 Budget is a good sign but not enough.Adding to the problem is the high cost of capital. \u201cThe ecosystem of renewable energy in India is still fraught with constraints, in particular with respect to financing,\u201d said an expert group set up by the Niti Aayog.Financing is available, but the terms are unattractive\u2014 high cost of debt, short-tenor loans, variable interest rates, adding up to as much as 30% of the cost. Policies to facilitate finance resulting in scaling up private sector investment are required. The risk of extreme and unexpected currency devaluation needs to be addressed to facilitate foreign investment.\u201cCurrency hedging in India is expensive, making foreign financing as expensive as domestic,\u201d explains Gireesh Shrimali of the Climate Policy Initiative. \u201cI think that the whole issue of cost of finance and especially currency hedging is a big issue,\u201d said Amin. The government has been considering innovative solutions but these are works in progress.But, resolving the finance piece alone would not be enough. \u201cThat brings us to the technological challenge, which would be about grid integration technology, including storage,\u201d said Mathur.Amin describes the technical challenge as a \u201cbig barrier\u201d. Niti Aayog concurs: \u201cIt is apparent that the attainment of the goal of 175gw of renewable energy by 2022 is no longer a financial challenge, but a technical one.\u201dCan the transmission system handle renewable energy, which, given the nature of the source, is periodic \u2014 unlike coal, gas or hydro? \u201cIndia\u2019s grid is outdated,\u201d says Nitin Pandit, CEO of WRI India, the India centre of the Washington-based think tank World Resources Institute. \u201cThe inability to evacuate power from renewable energy sources and the lack of sophisticated operational mechanisms to accommodate intermittency are substantial stumbling blocks which make renewable energy integration on a large scale very difficult,\u201d explains Pandit.Members of the Central Electricity Regulatory Authority, the country\u2019s apex power regulator, say the focus must shift to the grid, and the manner in which intermittent power like solar and wind energy are introduced. Sources say that the regulator is working on rules for ancilliary services, which will allow thermal and hydro stations to step in when renewable energy is not available.The Niti Aayog estimates that the cost of upgrading the interstate and intra-state transmission network to ease the injection of renewable power into the system is little more than Rs 120,000 crore. The government has set out public investment of Rs 38,000 crore for transmission in the green energy corridor.Srinivas Krishnaswamy, CEO of Vasudha Foundation, a Delhi-based not-for-profit working on renewable energy, says that the central government needs \u201csome out-of-the-box thinking and innovative plans to push states to contribute to a smart and flexible grid.\u201dBuy-in from the states is crucial. The government and the electricity regulator have taken some steps to encourage state participation in the renewable energy programme. Discoms are now mandated to source 8% of electricity from RE sources, interstate transmission charges have been waived for solar and wind. But Pandit points to the fact that big potential buyers, state distribution companies (discoms), \u201ccontinue to be a challenge because they are broke.\u201d Foreign investors also cite the financial ill-health of discoms as a concern. The government says that the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), a turnaround scheme announced in November, will help distribution companies become financially healthier.As the government focuses on surmounting the financial and technical challenges, KPMG points to another factor that could impact the rise of solar energy: a disruption in the manufacturing ecosystem on account of the slowing Chinese economy. This could be an opportunity, but one that needs working on. \u201cIndustrial competitiveness in manufacturing needs improvement because currently most Indian manufacturers are still below competitiveness with, for example, the Chinese manufacturers. There is some work to be done there,\u201d the IRENA boss points out.

VDeveloped nations are emitting more carbon than developing countries like India, Chief Justice of India today said while emphasising the importance of international law as a very "effective instrument" for protection of human rights and environment.\u000a\u000aHighlighting the importance of International Law in the current scenario, he said in the era of conflict of jurisdictions across the globe, it is an apt time that "we prepare ourselves to address issues like dispute of river water, space law, refugee law, custody of children."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThakur was adressing a seminar organised by International Law Association on the topic of 'Principles of Engagement of Domestic Courts with International Law & Recognition/Non- Recognition in International Law'.\u000a\u000a"The world is coming closer to provide a unified system of enforcement of law....We must prepare ourselves not only in terms of legislation but also in terms of our ability to address international issues as and when they arise," he said.\u000a\u000aReferring to developed nations in the context of environment, Thakur said, "Today if you see ozone layer decreasing it is not because India is emerging or it is dependent on coal for its power needs but it is because industrialised nations have been emitting carbon for the past 200 years."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"The dimensions of International Law have gone beyond the comprehension of any nation in the recent times. For example, issues regarding environment and climate change. Today, if environment degradation takes place in any part of the world, we are affected. An industrially advanced country, which emits carbon, depletes ozone layer and affects entire human race.\u000a\u000a"In international context if there was a law with respect to human rights or those living in less developed countries, it will be a very effective instrument," he said.\u000a\u000a"In Kyoto, a resolution was passed which said that let developed economies reduce their emission by 1 per cent. America, which even refused to reduce its emission by even 1 per cent, is today emitting something 10 metric tonnes more carbon per capita. It has emitted carbon for the past 200 years.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe announcement by World Bank president Jim Yong Kim of over $1 billion for India\u2019s solar energy initiatives has come as a major boost to the Andhra Pradesh power utilities.\u000a\u000aThe power utilities had planned to set up solar power projects in Anantapur, Kadapa and Kurnool districts with an aggregate capacity of 4,000 MW.\u000a\u000aLand for the projects was identified in the three districts and the process for its alienation had already begun. A joint venture company of the State and Central Governments and the A.P. Solar Power Corporation Limited had already been floated as a special purpose vehicle for monitoring the progress of the projects.\u000a\u000aThe utilities, however, appear to be in no hurry to scout for assistance proposed by the World Bank as they would be anyway benefited, if not directly, from the announcement made by the Bank. \u201cWe have adopted a different model for the solar power projects and may not go for the Bank\u2019s funding in the immediate future,\u201d a senior official said.\u000a\u000aAccording to officials, the utilities would allot land for the power projects along with basic infrastructure like connectivity and other facilities to the selected developers.\u000a\u000aThe developers would, in turn, be asked to pay an upfront amount calculated on the basis of the location and the land costs. \u201cThe value for the infrastructure in Kurnool, for instance, has been calculated at Rs.40 lakh per MW which the developer will have to pay as the upfront cost,\u201d the official told The Hindu .\u000a\u000aThe developer, in turn, would factor in this amount and prepare the tariff proposals, the official said, adding that though a proposal was mooted initially to approach lending agencies, it was subsequently put off after the Central Government announced incentives for promotion of renewable energy projects.\u000a\u000aUpfront charges\u000a\u000aThe upfront charges would be in addition to Rs. 20 lakh per MW grant provided by the Central Government for promoting solar energy projects.\u000a\u000aGiven the grant announced by the Centre, the State would stand to secure at least Rs.800 crore from the Centre for the 4,000 MW installed capacity planned.\u000a\u000aSenior officials said the State would anyway stand to benefit from the announcement as the money would be routed through the Central agencies, the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Corporation. \u201cWe can approach these agencies as and when required,\u201d the official said.

VLondon/New York: Searing temperatures caused by climate change may cost global economies more than $2 trillion by 2030, restricting working hours in some of the poorest parts of the world, according to United Nations research.\u000a\u000aAs many as 43 countries, especially those in Asia, including China, Indonesia, and Malaysia, will experience declines in their economies because of heat stress, says Tord Kjellstrom, a director at the Health and Environment International Trust, based in Nelson, New Zealand. As a result, China\u2019s gross domestic product would be reduced 1% and Indonesia\u2019s by 6% by 2030.\u000a\u000aExtreme heat in Southeast Asia already curbs annual working hours by 15 to 20%, and that figure could double by 2050 as climate change progresses, according to the paper published in Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe study was one of six papers published by the UN university in Kuala Lumpur detailing the impact of climate change on human health. From 1980 to 2012, it said about 2.1 million people worldwide died as a direct result of almost 21,000 natural catastrophes such as floods, mudslides, extreme heat, drought, high winds or fires. The cost of those disasters exceeded $4 trillion, a sum comparable to the current GDP of Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith heat stress, you cannot keep up the same intensity of work, and we\u2019ll see reduced speed of work and more rest in labor-intensive industries,\u201d Kjellstrom said. \u201cRich countries have the financial resources to adapt to climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2030, in both India and China, the GDP losses could total $450 billion, Kjellstrom said. The impact could be reduced by making major shift in working hours and changing how new factories are built to require less power to cool.\u000a\u000aLow and middle income countries are more likely to lose productivity from heat even though they contributed little to the causes of climate change in the form of greenhouse gas pollution, the report said. Richer countries will largely avoid losses from heat, the study found. Russia, Norway and Sweden may see productivity dip as a result of colder weather in winter.\u000a\u000aHeat stress is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skill jobs, such as heavy labour, farming, and manufacturing. That has the potential to increase the gap between rich and poor. Demand for air conditioning in offices, shopping malls and homes is likely to soar as temperatures rise, placing a strain on power supplies, according to the paper. A city the size of Bangkok may require as much as 2 gigawatts of generation for each increase of 1 degree Celsius in temperature, the study concluded.\u000a\u000aMore than 190 nations agreed in Paris in December to take steps toward limiting global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the pre-industrial times. For the Paris deal to enter into force, at least 55 countries representing 55% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions must ratify the agreement by 2020. UN officials expect the deal to come into effect this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to think more carefully about patterns of urban development,\u201d said Anthony Capon, a professor at the UN university. \u201cAs it is, high income countries have more capacity to insulate their people from health impacts of climate change. People in the poorer countries are the most effected.\u201d Bloomberg

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe Indian government has set an ambitious target of generating 100GW of energy from solar energy sources and 60GW from wind energy sources by 2022. As of March 31, 2016, the corresponding figures stood at 6.76GW and 26.7GW respectively. Unfortunately, renewable energy is more capital-intensive than coal, and financing this push will require $160 billion of capital, $120 billion as debt, and $40billion as equity.\u000a\u000aCurrently, most renewable projects are financed by bank commercial loans at 11-12 per cent interest per annum. The Indian banking sector is currently going through a balance sheet adjustment; banks are unlikely to be able to expand their balance sheets to be able to finance the additional requirements of the renewable sector. Green bonds may be able to fill this gap.\u000a\u000aClassifying green bonds\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA green bond is a fixed income instrument for the purpose of raising debt capital through markets. It certifies that the proceeds will be used exclusively for specific \u201cgreen\u201d purposes. The Green Bond Principles are voluntary guidelines issued by the International Capital Market Association which states the procedure for certifying a green bond. These encompass the use of proceeds, the evaluation procedure, the management of proceeds, and financial reporting. These guidelines are lacking in specifics, leading to a lack of consensus on what classifies as a green bond. Green bonds can provide a long-term source of debt capital for renewable infrastructure projects. Since the cost of debt availed for projects is higher than the yield for investment-grade bonds, it may be possible to reduce cost of capital for green infrastructure financed or refinanced by bonds. While green bonds can facilitate the flow of capital to low carbon infrastructure investments, the demand for such investment is driven by low-carbon policy mandates. An enabling policy context is therefore vital for the success of green bonds.\u000a\u000aThere are many ways by which the government currently provides subsidies for green projects. The first is through accelerated depreciation provisions, whereby capital expenditure is allowed to be depreciated by 80 per cent in the first year and the remaining in the following five years. Feed-in tariffs are long-term contracts with discoms to purchase power from a renewable project, usually at higher rates. A viability gap funding is a capital grant from the government that bridges the gap between project cost under the prevailing electricity rate and the price quoted by the developer. Under a generation-based incentive, the government provides Rs. 0.5/kWh (kilowatt hour) supplied to the grid, subject to a cumulative maximum of Rs.10 million/MW. The incentive must be drawn over a minimum of four years and a maximum of 10 years. Under renewable purchase obligations, the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) has set an ambitious RPO target of 15 per cent by 2020.\u000a\u000aGreen bonds would enable investor diversification, mitigate risks since the repayment is tied to the issuer only, build a community of green investors, and enable refinancing bank loans at a lower cost. Assets under management by signatories to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) are around $60 trillion so far, and an increasing number of institutional investors and financial institutions globally are publicly pledging to increase their green bond holdings.\u000a\u000aSince February 2015, some banks and companies too have raised funds via green bonds. Currently, there is no pricing advantage for banks in issuing green bonds and likewise to the borrowers whose projects were invested in.\u000a\u000aDeveloping a green bond market\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGreen bonds have been around for a decade but regulation and investment in them is still minuscule compared to the total market for debt mainly on account of lack of green bond standards, low credit rating of potential issuers, and higher cost of issuance. Considering that fossil fuels have enjoyed huge subsidies throughout their history (namely, subsidised diesel, kerosene and gas) and have contributed to environmental degradation and global warming, it is apt that clean energy initiatives get equitable treatment. In order to develop a green bond market, the government essentially needs to increase the funds available for investment in green projects, by providing for specific tax incentives and development of long-term finance markets in general.\u000a\u000aSome of the key actionable steps would be changing Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority norms for size of investment for insurance companies, creating mandates for provident funds to invest in infrastructure and environmentally sustainable projects, increasing the priority sector lending limit for bank loans under solar energy from a meagre Rs.15 crore, standardising the definition of green to be able to target government efforts in the direction, and mobilising retail savings by way of tax exemption on the lines of Section 80CCF.\u000a\u000aThough the market is nascent, broad guidelines are coming to the fore. As the market matures, investors will require that green bond issuers report on status of deployment and environmental outcomes of the investments. For the green bond market to have long-term credibility, investors and governments would need evidence that the projects funded have in fact delivered the intended environmental benefits. The Indian government can lead the global push towards green by taking three steps to reduce our races\u2019 carbon footprint: standardise \u201cgreen\u201d bonds as a way to finance environmentally sustainable projects, provide incentives to investing in projects funded by a carbon tax on polluting sources of energy and, finally, increase funds channelled towards investing in environmentally sustainable projects.\u000a\u000aSaurabh Roy is a Fellow at Pahle India Foundation

VStoring carbon dioxide (CO2) in reservoirs deep underground may be better for the climate than emitting the gas directly into the atmosphere as researchers have found that this process is much safer over long periods of time than previously thought.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that natural accumulations of CO2 that have been trapped underground for around 100,000 years have not significantly corroded the rocks above.\u000a\u000aThese findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrate the viability of a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a solution to reducing carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired power stations, the researchers said.\u000a\u000a"With careful evaluation, burying carbon dioxide underground will prove very much safer than emitting CO2 directly to the atmosphere," said lead author Mike Bickle, Professor at University of Cambridge.\u000a\u000aCarbon capture and storage involves capturing the carbon dioxide produced at power stations, compressing it, and pumping it into reservoirs in the rock more than a kilometre underground.\u000a\u000aThe CO2 must remain buried for at least 10,000 years to avoid the impacts on climate.\u000a\u000aOne concern in this process is that the dilute acid, formed when the stored CO2 dissolves in water present in the reservoir rocks, might corrode the rocks above and let the CO2 escape upwards.\u000a\u000aThe new research found that CO2 can be securely stored underground for far longer than the 10,000 years needed to avoid climatic impacts.\u000a\u000aThe study showed that the critical component in geological carbon storage, the relatively impermeable layer of "cap rock" that retains the CO2, can resist corrosion from CO2-saturated water for at least 100,000 years.\u000a\u000aTo understand these effects, this study examined a natural reservoir in the US state of Utah where large natural pockets of CO2 have been trapped in sedimentary rocks for hundreds of thousands of years.\u000a\u000aThe team drilled deep down below the surface into one of these natural CO2 reservoirs to recover samples of the rock layers and the fluids confined in the rock pores.\u000a\u000a"A major obstacle to the implementation of CCS is the uncertainty over the long-term fate of the CO2 which impacts regulation, insurance, and who assumes the responsibility for maintaining CO2 storage sites. Our study demonstrates that geological carbon storage can be safe and predictable over many hundreds of thousands of years," Bickle said.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000agb/vt

VThe newer, more efficient, cleaner cookstoves, designed to reduce household air pollution that worsens climate change, have failed to deliver hoped-for benefits in the field, suggests a recent study.\u000a\u000aResearchers from the University of British Columbia, and elsewhere measured ambient and indoor household air pollution before and after a carbon-finance-approved cookstove intervention in rural and found that the improvements were less than anticipated.\u000a\u000aActual indoor concentrations measured in the field were only moderately lower for the new stoves than for traditional stoves, according to the paper.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, 40 percent of families who used a more efficient wood stove as part of the intervention also elected to continue using traditional stoves, which they preferred for making staple dishes such as roti bread. That duplication erased many of the hoped-for efficiency and pollution improvements.\u000a\u000aLaboratory studies suggested that the more efficient, cleaner-burning stoves could reduce a family's fuelwood consumption by up to 67 percent, thereby reducing household air pollution and deforestation. In practice, there was no statistically significant difference in fuel consumption between families who used the new stoves and families who continued to cook over open fires or traditional stoves.\u000a\u000aWithout field-based evaluations, clean cookstove interventions may be pursued under carbon financing programs that fail to realize expected carbon reductions or anticipated health and climate benefits, the study concluded.\u000a\u000a"A stove may perform well in the lab, but a critical question is what happens in the real world?" said lead author Ther Wint Aung. "Women who are busy tending crops and cooking meals and caring for children are using stoves in a number of ways in the field that don't match conditions in the lab."\u000a\u000aAcross all households, average indoor concentrations of particulate matter, an unhealthy component of cooking smoke that can contribute to lung and heart disease, increased after the intervention stoves were introduced, likely because of seasonal weather patterns or food rituals that required more cooking.\u000a\u000aThe median increase, however, was smaller in homes where families exclusively used intervention stoves - 51 micrograms per cubic meter, compared to 92 micrograms per cubic meter for families who used both intervention and traditional stoves and 139 micrograms per cubic meter for the control group of families who continued cooking on a traditional stove.\u000a\u000a"On the one hand, there was less of an increase in some pollution levels and that's a win. But on the other hand, it feels pretty far from a complete solution," said co-author Julian Marshall.\u000a\u000aCo-author Michael Brauer noted, "Ultimately households throughout the world will desire the same clean cooking technologies used in high-income countries and in most urban areas: electricity or gas. This study suggests that the interim solution of cleaner biomass stoves remains elusive."\u000a\u000aThe study is published in June in Environmental and Technology.

VNEW DELHI: In a unique study showing how different regions of the planet may react to global warming differently, researchers have shown that people in the Himalayas will have to contend with flooding, while those in the Andes will have longer dry spells and less water.The researchers, from ETH, Zurich in Switzerland and Utrecht University used measurement data and climate models to closely examine water balance in both of these mountain ranges. Both have peaks that rise to over 6,000 metres and also glaciers. Climate models for the remainder of the century indicate that both regions will experience similar increases in annual mean temperatures - the milder scenarios predict a rise of one to three degrees, the more extreme as much as four to six degrees. The study is published in the journal PNAS.To calculate and compare each region's water balance, the researchers created a new and very extensive model of the upper Langtang valley in Nepal and the Juncal region of the central Andes in Chile. Both are important water catchment areas for the millions of people who live in the surrounding lowlands.In the upper Langtang valley, water discharge will increase in the first half of this century, in the extreme scenario, by as much as 70 percent. Maximum discharge could be reached by around 2050 to 2060, after which discharge is expected to remain the same or drop steadily as we move towards the year 2100.The Juncal region is set to become drier in the future. During the dry season, which is already quite long, river water will become scarce. According to their calculations, the researchers still expect water discharge to remain at current levels in the period from 2010 to 2030. However, after that, there will be a steady decline in the amount of water available. So in an extreme scenario, water discharge from the entire catchment area in the Juncal region could shrink to a third of the current level by the year 2100.Just how much water is carried by streams and rivers ultimately depends on the fates of the local glaciers. Glaciers in both areas are going to shrink, with those in the Juncal region diminishing by up to 70 percent while in Langtang, the more extreme predictions indicate a loss of "only" 55 percent.In turn, the different degrees of glacial melt will also lead to differing scenarios in terms of water discharge: in Langtang, the proportion of glacial melt in the discharge will increase and peak by 2050 before receding. In Juncal, glacial melt already peaked before 2010, and now the proportion of discharge from glacial melt is dropping steadily. This is explained by the fact that the Langtang glaciers are situated at very high altitudes.Once they melt at some point in the future, this meltwater will then replace that which today comes from glaciers lower down. What's more, the tongues of many glaciers in Langtang are covered in massive layers of rock debris; these insulate the glaciers, which then recede less quickly. In Juncal, however, the highest glaciers are already melting, as they are situated lower than those in the Himalayas.The new model also indicates that Langtang could be in for increased rainfall in the future, which will exacerbate the effect the increasing glacier melt is having on water discharge. But this is not the case in Chile, where the drought in the summer months of December to March will get worse.Today, farmers in Chile's most fertile regions use meltwater to irrigate their fields. "If the upper basins of rivers deliver less water in the future, it will be essential to take action to encourage conservation of the country's water reserves," says corresponding author Silvan Ragettli, post-doctoral student at the Institute of Environmental Engineering at ETH Zurich.In contrast, efforts in the Nepalese Himalayas will have to focus on flood management. Climate change will mean higher snow lines. This will increase the amount of rain that falls in high elevations. "Increased precipitation in the form of rain means that water runs off immediately, which in turn can lead to massive flooding," says Ragettli.

VAsk any CFO of a renewable energy company about \u2018green bonds\u2019, you will get an answer which may not vary even in language: \u201cWe are looking at it carefully.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith every company worth the name \u201clooking at\u201d green bonds, it might give you an impression that Indian entities are about to dash abroad and come back with pockets stuffed with cash.\u000a\u000aThe reality, however, is the opposite. While globally green bonds are going great guns, Indian companies find no particular advantage in this mode of raising funds.\u000a\u000aBecause global climate funds have been assumed to be a big source for developing green projects in India, organisations such as the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think-tank, have called for some government intervention.\u000a\u000aGreen bonds (or climate bonds) are debt instruments like any other, except that there is a condition that the funds raised shall be used only for \u2018green projects\u2019, such as renewable energy, energy-saving and fuel-efficiency.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, when the concept began taking root abroad, there was no formal definition of \u2018green projects\u2019, but standards have since evolved. The main body of standards are those developed by the \u2018Climate Bond Standards Board\u2019, an organisation of funds that have among them around $35 trillion.\u000a\u000aThe basic principle behind \u2018green bonds\u2019 is \u2018greenium\u2019, or the premium an investor is willing to pay for green projects.\u000a\u000aThis means that investors settle for lower returns, resulting in cheaper financing for green projects, such as wind and solar.\u000a\u000aGreenium, or the yield sacrifice the investors make is clearly not good enough for Indian companies, primarily because of the cost of hedging\u000a\u000aAccording to Green Bonds Initiative, a not-for-profit organisation that intends to develop green bonds market, the outstanding climate-aligned bonds (whether labelled green or not) is about $ 694 billion, till the end of May. Labelled bond issues have been going up fast\u2014from $ 11 billion in 2013; $36 b in 2014; $42 billion in 2015 and $45 billion till May 2016. The average coupon rate for \u2018investment grade\u2019 bonds works out to 3.7 per cent; for low grade bonds 6.9 per cent.\u000a\u000aThese rates are attractive as long as one does not add the cost of hedging for currency depreciation.\u000a\u000aIndian benchmark 10-year government of India bond today yields 7.5 per cent. \u201cFor any foreign currency bond issue, fully hedged, the total cost works out the same as borrowing in India,\u201d says T B Kapali, a Chennai-based financial analyst.\u000a\u000aHe says that there are price advantages only if a company is daring enough to leave at least a portion of the borrowing unhedged.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrice benefits are very modest, so it is more the big and blue-chip companies that can take advantage of green bonds,\u201d says Sean Kidney, CEO of Green Bonds Initiative.\u000a\u000aThe big and blue-chip companies anyway find it better to borrow within India. So far, only three Indian companies have come out with green bond issuance (CLP India Rs 600 crore, Hero Future Energies \u20b9300 crore and ReNew Power Rs 451 crore) and all of them were domestic issues. (The other five issuers have been financial institutions \u2014Yes Bank, Exim Bank, IREDA, IDBI Bank and Axis Bank.)\u000a\u000aIn all, Indian companies have raised a mere \u20b91,451 crore through green bonds. (The public sector, Energy Efficiency Services Ltd, has said it would raise $ 100 million by an overseas green bond issue, but then the company intends to use it for expanding its operations abroad, so hedging may not be required.)\u000a\u000aAlso, all the Indian companies that issued green bonds are big ones, each with a GW of assets, including those under construction.\u000a\u000aThese companies get good rates by virtue of their size, not because they are green. Samir Ashta, CFO of the wind power company, CLP India, says that his company got a good rate of 9.15 per cent because of its size and ratings, not necessarily because of the \u2018green-ness' of its operations.\u000a\u000aIndian green projects do need funding from abroad. Sunil Jain, Executive Director and CEO of Hero Future Energies, notes that green bond funding is crucial for India to achieve its green goals, including 175 MW of clean energy projects.\u000a\u000aHow do smaller Indian companies get funding? Banks are not able to lend enough. As ADB officials, Dan Lambert and Siddharta Shah, note in their blog, the need for funds for India\u2019s infrastructure far exceeds banks\u2019 credit limits.\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, a recent study of the Council on Environment, Energy and Water and the US-based National Resources Defense Council, a US-based not-for-profit environmental advocacy group, has (among other suggestions) called for government intervention \u2013 mainly in the form of a fund that could offer \u2018credit enhancement\u2019 (or loan guarantees).\u000a\u000aIts other suggestions, such as more tax-free bonds, relate to raising debt from within the country, a credit enhancement mechanism is what the hour needs, say industry experts.\u000a\u000aThere is a precedent. Twenty-eight per cent of ReNew Power\u2019s \u20b9451-crore green bond issue was partly guaranteed by the public sector India Infrastructure Finance Company, and half of it was counter-guaranteed by ADB.\u000a\u000a\u201cTogether, the partial guarantees boost the credit rating of a typical infrastructure project from ratings as low as BBB to at least AA, making the bonds attractive to institutional investors,\u201d say Lambert and Shah in their blog.\u000a\u000aThough the ReNew Power bond was issued in India, the mechanism would work well for overseas issues as well. Government-owned infrastructure-focused, non banking finance companies, such as IIFCL and IREDA, could offer credit enhancements that will make the cost of a green bond issue abroad cheaper, says Kapali.

VMUMBAI: After you've fried those spicy chicken nuggets and drumsticks, what do you do with the leftover oil? Perhaps reuse it for cooking, or dump the grease down the drain. Right?Ever wondered what happens to used cooking oil generated in the kitchens of five-star hotels? Well, in some cases the waste is being put to work, helping power local trains, luxury sedans, Jacuzzi, lifts and hot water boiler operations.Five-star Westin hotel in Singapore deploys used cooking oil from its kitchens to power limousines. Likewise, a five-star hotel brand in India produces its own renewable energy from cooking oil waste for its luxury sedans that ferry guests from the airport to the property.A shunter service between Chennai and Perambur Loco Works in Tamil Nadu is run on biodiesel generated from the used cooking oil provided by The Hilton Chennai. The 253-key hotel churns out about 450 litres of cooking grease waste every month and supplies it to the Indian Railways to be converted into biofuel.At the railways' Parel workshop in Mumbai, forklift trucks operate on biofuel generated from the cooking oil waste produced by Leela Mumbai. "It's a relatively fuss-free process to extract biodiesel from cooking oil. However, there is not much awareness about it and hence we get only a small quantity of used cooking oil," said Narendra Patil, chief PRO, Central Railways.Andre Gomez, head (operations), Hilton Worldwide, said the company "focuses on measuring and managing our waste output and diversions, while also continually looking for creative ways to reduce our waste footprint".Some hotels in India run the entire hot water process at their property using fuel generated from cooking oil waste. The Park Hyatt Hyderabad operates its sauna and steam facilities with energy produced from the hotel's edible cooking oil residue. The 200-plus room property collects cooking oil waste from its restaurants every day and converts it into 300-400 litres of biodiesel to run geysers and Jacuzzi."We do not dump the restaurant grease or used cooking oil. A process is in place to collect the oil from our restaurants and kitchens. It is made to chemically react with an alcohol (like ethanol) to produce fatty acid esters or biodiesel, which is used for the hotel's steam and hot water boiler operation," said Suresh Kumar, director (engineering) at Park Hyatt Hyderabad. Operating a boiler using biodiesel costs the hotel Rs 10 a litre, while diesel costs them Rs 45 a litre. "It helps in having a better control over the hotel's waste," said Kumar.India consumes about 21 million tonnes of edible oils and generates 2 million tonnes of cooking oil waste annually, said Sandeep Chaturvedi, president of Biodiesel Association of India. Hotels are increasingly putting waste cooking oil to good use, reducing carbon emissions, cutting operating costs and improving the energy efficiency. The Radisson Blu Plaza Delhi, Hilton Garden Inn Trivandrum and ITC Maratha Mumbai offer the cooking oil residue to local industries for manufacturing soap, rubber and detergents.At the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, an in-house sewage treatment plant segregates oil from water, which is then treated and used for gardening. The hotel sells the oil residue to local manufacturers. The Park Hyatt Hyderabad is experimenting to produce fuel from plastic waste.Globally, hospitality chains have either set up a micro-refinery or have a tie-up with a biodiesel player to turn waste cooking oil into energy. Though hotels, unlike other sectors like manufacturing, account for only around 1% of emissions, they have taken measures worldwide to reduce their carbon footprint. "As a global company with more than 4,660 hotels in 104 countries, we place high priority on the efficient and responsible use of natural resources and minimizing our impact," said Hilton's Gomez.Hotels normally give their wastes to waste management companies or municipal certified pick-up facilities. Only in some cases, they donate leftovers to charity. Hotels avoid donating leftovers on concerns of people falling ill due to food poisoning, which, they fear, may lead to lawsuits.

VOslo, Norway: Sea ice around Antarctica shrank in a warm period more than 100,000 years ago, an indication that man-made climate change could also trigger an abrupt retreat, a scientific report said Tuesday.\u000a\u000aA thaw would reverse a paradoxical expansion of the extent of floating ice on the ocean around the frozen continent in recent decades, apparently defying the trend of global warming blamed on greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aWinter sea ice around Antarctica shrank 65% in a natural warm period between Ice Ages about 128,000 years ago, when temperatures were slightly warmer than now, according to the report in the journal Nature Communications.\u000a\u000aThe conclusions were based on ancient ice cores drilled from deep in the Antarctic ice sheet. The chemistry of snow indicates how far it blew from the ocean before it landed and got compressed into ice.\u000a\u000aThe ancient shrinking of the ice helps underpin forecasts by a panel of UN climate experts that global warming will mean a 58% retreat in Antarctica\u2019s sea ice by around the year 2200, the British scientific team that wrote the report concluded.\u000a\u000a\u201cA major reduction at 128,000 years ago could indicate a tipping point in the sea ice system,\u201d they wrote.\u000a\u000aLead author Max Holloway of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) told Reuters that the ancient shrinking of sea ice may have preceded a collapse of an ice sheet in West Antarctica that spilled into the sea and pushed up sea levels.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith a major reduction in sea ice, you\u2019d expect the ice sheets to be more sensitive,\u201d he said. Separately, in 2014 another study suggested that some glaciers in West Antarctica have already begun an irreversible thaw.\u000a\u000aAlso read: Nasa: Last month was Earth\u2019s hottest in recorded history\u000a\u000aSceptics who reject mainstream scientific findings about global warming often point to the expansion of sea ice around Antarctica as evidence. Sea ice in the Arctic at the other end of the planet has been shrinking in recent decades.\u000a\u000aScientists say the contradictory trends may partly be because Antarctica is a continent surrounded by an open ocean, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land - mainly Russia, Canada, Greenland and Alaska.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy uncovering, for the first time, a huge retreat around Antarctica, we have established that sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere is also susceptible to major climate changes,\u201d co-author Louise Sime of BAS said in a statement.

VThe British government gave the green light today for what it called the world's biggest offshore wind farm to be built off the English coast.\u000a\u000aThe Hornsea Project Two farm should have up to 300 turbines and a capacity of up to 1.8 gigawatts. It could produce enough energy to power 1.6 million homes.\u000a\u000aIt is an extension of the 1.2GW Hornsea Project One which was in itself being trumpeted as the world's biggest offshore wind farm.\u000a\u000aBoth projects are being developed by Danish group DONG Energy, the world's largest operator of offshore wind farms.\u000a\u000adecided Tuesday to grant development consent for Hornsea Project Two, located 90 kilometres east of the English coast.\u000a\u000aDONG Energy made the final investment decision earlier this year on Hornsea Project One, but is yet to commit formally to funding the second wave.\u000a\u000aBritish business minister Greg Clark said: " is a global leader in offshore wind, and we're determined to be one of the leading destinations for investment in renewable energy.\u000a\u000a"The UK's offshore wind industry has grown at an extraordinary rate over the last few years, and is a fundamental part of our plans to build a clean, affordable, secure energy system."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf built to full capacity, the Hornsea Project Two investment would total around 6 billion pounds.\u000a\u000aThe farm would create up to 1,960 construction jobs and 580 operational and maintenance jobs, the government said.\u000a\u000aBrent Cheshire, DONG Energy's chairman, welcomed the development consent.\u000a\u000a"Hornsea Project Two provides us with another exciting development opportunity in offshore wind," he said.\u000a\u000aThe government said it expected 10GW of offshore wind to be installed by the end of the decade and a further 10GW of offshore wind capacity could be built in the 2020s.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VThe human impact on Earth\u2019s chemistry and climate has cut short the 11,700-year-old geological epoch known as the Holocene and ushered in a new one, scientists said Monday.\u000a\u000aThe Anthropocene, or \u201cnew age of man,\u201d would start from the mid-20th century if their recommendation -- submitted Monday to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa -- is adopted.\u000a\u000aThat approval process is likely to take at least two years and requires ratification by three other academic bodies.\u000a\u000aBut after seven years of deliberation, the 35-strong Working Group has unanimously recognised the Anthropocene as a reality, and voted 30-to-three (with two abstentions) for the transition to be officially registered.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur working model is that the optimal boundary is the mid-20th century,\u201d said Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf adopted -- and we\u2019re a long way from that -- the Holocene would finish and the Anthropocene would formally be held to have begun.\u201d\u000a\u000aScientists refer to the period starting from 1950 as the \u201cGreat Acceleration\u201d, and a glance at graphs tracking a number of chemical and socio-economic changes make it obvious why.\u000a\u000aConcentrations in the air of carbon dioxide, methane and stratospheric ozone; surface temperatures, ocean acidification, marine fish harvesting, and tropical forest loss; population growth, construction of large dams, international tourism -- all of them take off from about mid-century.\u000a\u000aOne of the main culprits is global warming driven by the burning of fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aA telltale surge in the spread of invasive plant and animal species is also a legacy of our species.\u000a\u000aBut the working group is not allowed to take any of these measures into consideration unless they show up in the geological record.\u000a\u000aIf it can\u2019t be measured in rocks, lake sediments, ice cores, or other such formations -- the criteria used to determine dozens of distinct eons, era, periods and ages going back four billion years -- it doesn\u2019t count.\u000a\u000aThis, however, is not a problem when it comes to the Anthropocene, said Zalasiewicz.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are spoiled for choice,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole array of potential signals out there.\u201d\u000a\u000aMicro-plastics, for example -- a synthetic, man-made substance -- \u201care now components of sediment around the world, both in land and in the sea.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd the rise in atmospheric CO2 shows up in ice cores reaching back tens of thousands of years.\u000a\u000a- Golden spike -\u000a\u000aPast shifts in the biosphere -- the realm of the living -- show up in sediment and rock, especially mass extinctions marking boundaries when up to 95 percent of all lifeforms disappeared within the geological blink of an eye.\u000a\u000aThe wipeout of non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period is one such die off, though far from the most dramatic.\u000a\u000aThe word \u201cAnthropocene\u201d -- first proposed in 2002 by Nobel chemistry laureate Paul Crutzen -- has been adopted by environmentalists as a rallying cry against Big Oil, and is viewed by some conservatives as a stalking horse for what they see as aggressive, economy-choking policies to combat climate change.\u000a\u000aThere are sceptical scientists too.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe drive to officially recognise the Anthropocene may, in fact, be political rather than scientific,\u201d said Stanley Finney, a professor at California State University at Long Beach and chair of the International Commission on Stratigraphy -- one of the bodies that must validate the new epoch.\u000a\u000aFinney\u2019s main objection is that not enough time has elapsed for a new epoch.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s duration is that of an average human lifespan,\u201d he wrote in a pointed commentary, published by the Geological Society of America.\u000a\u000aIf the Anthropocene is voted into existence, scientists will have to pick a \u201cgolden spike\u201d to mark the transition.\u000a\u000aThe spike nails down a date, but also pinpoints a primary \u201csignal\u201d at a specific location.\u000a\u000aThe working group was divided on what that essential signal might be, but traces of nuclear bomb explosions emerged as a favourite.\u000a\u000aAs for what form the evidence will take, Zalasiewicz said it is still early days. \u201cFast-growing coral form a layered archive that traps chemistry nicely,\u201d he noted.\u000a\u000aTo mark the start of the Holocene, scientists chose an ice core sample drilled in 2003 from the central Greenland ice sheet at coordinates 75.10 degrees N/42.32 degrees W.\u000a\u000aThe core is archived in a freezer at the University of Copenhagen.

VA warming planet might not dry out Earth as much as previously believed, because plants will become less thirsty as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises, researchers said today.\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have projected that more than 70 per cent of the planet will experience more drought as carbon-dioxide levels quadruple from pre-industrial levels over about the next 100 years, said the report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u000a\u000aBut many of these models fail to account for how plant behaviour will change in a warming world.\u000a\u000aPlants take in CO2 through openings called stomata, which also release moisture. But when CO2 is abundant, these stomata stay open for shorter periods, lose less water, and therefore need less water from the soil.\u000a\u000a"A number of studies assume that plant water needs are staying constant, when what we know about plants growing in lots of carbon dioxide suggests the opposite," said lead author Abigail Swann, a assistant professor of atmospheric sciences and biology.\u000a\u000aSwann found that only about 37 per cent of the world will face climate change-driven drought, because plants benefit from an environment with more carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aA hotter world with less rain will likely increase droughts across southern North America, southern Europe and northeastern South America, said the study.\u000a\u000a"But the results show that in Central Africa and temperate Asia - including China, the Middle East, East Asia and most of Russia - water conservation by plants will largely counteract the parching due to climate change," it said.\u000a\u000aThe findings still show that droughts will increase as the climate changes, just not as far and wide as some have predicted.\u000a\u000a"There's a lot we don't know, especially about hot droughts," Swann said.\u000a\u000a"Even if droughts are not extremely more prevalent or frequent, they may be more deadly when they do happen," she said.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VADODARA/ANAND: India's first solar cooperative - the 'Dhundi Saur Urja Utpadak Sahakari Mandali (DSUUSM)' in Kheda district- received the first payment of Rs 36,005 for selling 5,097 units electricity to the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Limited (MGVCL) on Monday. Six farmers of Dhundi village in Kheda district's Thasra taluka, some 35 km from Anand, in had registered DSUUSM in February by connecting a solar-powered irrigation pump to electricity grid."Anand, the birthplace of Amul's milk cooperatives and India's White Revolution is now inspiring an Orange Revolution powered by solar farmers," said R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), who handed over the first income cheques to the farmer members. The function was organized by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) at the Institute of Rural Management, Anand.With the support from IWMI and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, the farmers have installed 56.4 kWp of solar capacity which they use for irrigation as well as for selling surplus power to MGVCL.Between May 10 when the evacuation started and July 31, the farmers evacuated 5,097 units of electricity to the grid for which MGVCL has agreed to pay Rs 4.63 per unit. These units could have been used to pump an additional 25 million litres of groundwater. Before the cooperative, farmers were using diesel pumps which have now been replaced by solar pumps, leading to a reduction of 1.6 tonnes of carbon emissions."Recognising these positive impacts, the IWMI-Tata Water Policy Program (ITP) has offered the mandali 'water conservation' (Rs 1.25 per unit) and 'green energy' (Rs 1.25 per unit) bonuses in addition to the price paid by MGVCL," said IWMI's Tushaar Shah, who led the research pilot."The National Solar Mission aims at reaching 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022 and mentions two major paths for doing so - Rooftop solar systems and MW-scale solar power plants. ITP has been arguing that solarizing agriculture is better than both these ways," said Shah."Solarizing the highly subsidized farm power segment will improve the utilities' finances while putting additional income in the hands of our farmers. Another advantage of this model is the minimal land footprint since farmers can continue to use land under solar panels to grow crops," he added.

VA Bench headed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar issued notices to the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Delhi government on Thursday on a plea by scientist Mahendra Pandey seeking direction to draft, finalise and implement the State Action Plan on Climate Change on the lines and the spirit of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).\u000a\u000aDirections\u000a\u000aIt has also sought directions to the Arvind Kejriwal government to place on record relevant material and documents related to the steps taken by it in order to implement Action Plan on Climate Change. The tribunal has sought the replies reply by October 17.\u000a\u000aThe scientist has claimed that the Capital does not have a State Action Plan on Climate Change on the lines of NAPCC. The NAPCC is a comprehensive action plan which outlines measures on climate change related adaptation and mitigation while simultaneously advancing development.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental issues\u000a\u000aThe scientist, in his plea filed through advocate Gaurav Bansal, contended that Delhi was facing a number of environmental issues due to ill-effects of climate change. The government of NCT of Delhi claims that it formulated a Climate Change Agenda for the Capital in 2009.\u000a\u000aHowever, the agenda expired in 2012 and Delhi has no Action Plan on Climate Change since then, the plea alleged.\u000a\u000aThe scientist contended that the Capital had generates around 800 million tonne of garbage daily and the same is dumped as it is on three main landfill sites, which have already completed their life.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy continuously dumping of large quantity of solid waste, the respondents are compromising with the air quality, which ultimately is contributing to climate change\u2026 As per the report of IIT-Kanpur, the petitioner has learnt that domestic cooking, road dust, waste burning, diesel generators, etc., release PM2.5, PM10, etc., in the atmosphere and as such are major contributors to the climate change,\u201d the plea added.\u000a\u000aDespite the July 23, 2015, directions by the NGT to prepare their respective plan expeditiously, the Delhi government has not yet prepared or approved the same till date, it said.\u000a\u000aThe NGT had last year directed all the States and Union Territories to \u201cexpeditiously\u201d prepare action plans on climate change in according with the Centre\u2019s guidelines and get them approved by the Union Environment Ministry.\u000a\u000aPlea claims Delhi does not have a State Action Plan on Climate Change on the lines of NAPCC

Nagoor Ali Jinnah, Chief General Manager, NABARD.\u000a\u000aLaunching the project here on Thursday, he said that it would integrate risk mitigation measures. Over 28 per cent of the NABARD\u2019s cumulative disbursements, roughly Rs.50,000 crore, have links with climate change adaptation and mitigation.\u000a\u000aIn Tamil Nadu, 10 watershed projects \u2013 Anjukulipatti, Iyyalur and Sri Ramapuram in Dindigul, Salivaram, Bettamangalam and Tallikottam in Krishnagiri, Peikulam, Chithalai and Chinnapulampatti in Madurai and Vannikonendal in Tirunvelveli districts \u2013 were identified under this project. Technology integration, community participation, risk mitigation and digital solution exercises were main components of the project.\u000a\u000aImpact of climate change on soil, agriculture, forests, pastureland, livestock and communities within these watersheds would be studied. On this basis, treatment measures would be implemented.\u000a\u000aThe project will be implemented at a cost of Rs.7 crore of which TN share would be Rs.3.5 crore. Summer ploughing, integrated management and construction of well recharge pits were other project components, said V. Mashar, DGM, NABARD.\u000a\u000aJoint Director of Agriculture M. Thangasamy said seven lakh acres of land were taken up for non-farm purpose in the country every year. Water table had gone down below 1,000 feet in Oddanchatram. Technology alone will protect agriculture, he added.

The Paris agreement aims to limit global temperature increases to two degrees centigrade, and will be triggered after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, ratify it.\u000a\u000aTwo biggest pollutors\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChina is responsible for almost a quarter of the world\u2019s emissions, with the U.S. in second place on around 15 per cent, so their participation is crucial.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s Parliament ratified the agreement earlier on Saturday, and Mr. Xi said the Asian giant was \u201csolemnly\u201d committed to the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cHopefully this will encourage other countries to take similar efforts,\u201d he said in Hangzhou, where he is to host the G20 summit of the world\u2019s leading developed and emerging economies.\u000a\u000aUntil Saturday, only 24 of the signatories had ratified the accord, including France and many island states threatened by rising sea levels but who only produce a tiny proportion of the world\u2019s emissions.\u000a\u000aMr. Ban said there would be a \u201chigh level\u201d meeting in New York later this month to push more countries do so, and told the two leaders that they had \u201cadded powerful momentum\u201d to efforts to bring the accord into force.\u000a\u000aClimate is one of the few areas where the world\u2019s two most powerful countries \u2014 who are at loggerheads on issues ranging from trade disputes, cyber-spying and the South China Sea \u2014 are able to find common cause.\u000a\u000aCampaigners welcomed the move, with WWF saying the two giants economies had sent \u201ca very powerful signal that there will be real global action on climate change\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe Paris pact calls for capping global warming at well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and 1.5 C (2.7 F) if possible, compared with pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aIndividual commitments\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUnder the Paris accord, China has pledged to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20 per cent. In its Paris commitment, the U.S. promised to cut its own emissions 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025.\u000a\u000aFor its part the White House is looking for the Paris accord to come into force during Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure, in part to burnish his climate legacy, but also to ensure the forthcoming U.S. election does not obstruct U.S. participation. The administration is arguing that the deal does not need Congressional approval for ratification, which can be done by executive order.  AFP, 2016

VNEW DELHI: In a big step towards bringing the global climate deal into force before this year end, the United States and China - the world\u2019s top two emitters of greenhouse gases - on Saturday ratified the Paris Agreement which was approved by the 195 countries, including India, in December last year.The move has now put the attention on India and European Union (EU) about the timing of their formally joining the agreement. India is expected to ratify it by the year end.The Paris Agreement will enter into force only after at least 55 countries, accounting for minimum 55 % of total global emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification. So far, 26 countries (accounting for over 39% of the global emission) have ratified the agreementThe Agreement is meant to limit the global warming \u201cwell below\u201d 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible, to increase economic and social ability to adapt to extreme climate and also to direct the scale and speed of global financial flows to match the required low carbon and climate-resilient development. As many as 180 countries, including India, have, so far, signed this agreement. The ratifation is the final step before the global climate deal comes into force.The US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday submitted their instruments of ratification to formally join the Paris agreement to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ahead of the G20 leaders summit at Hangzhou in China. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be there at Hangzhou to attend the G20 summit.Urging world leaders, particularly G20 countries, to accelerate their domestic ratification processes, Ban Ki-moon in Hangzhou said, \u201cWe just need another 29 countries representing 16% of global emissions to bring this Paris Agreement into force. I am hopeful and optimistic that we can do it before the end of this year and before my term as Secretary-General of the United Nations ends\u201d.\u201cI would like today to thank China and the United States for ratifying this landmark agreement\u2014an agreement on which rests the opportunity for a sustainable future for every nation and every person,\u201d said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u201cThe earlier that Paris is ratified and implemented in full, the more secure that future will become," she said in a statement, issued by the UNFCCC from Bonn.The UN Secretary General\u2019s special event in New York on September 21 will offer a further focused opportunity for other countries to join the Paris Agreement.Besides ratifying the Paris Agreement, China and the US on Saturday also announced support for increased action on aviation and refrigerant (HFCs) emissions. Both the countries announced that they were working together to secure a comprehensive and ambitious amendment of a sister treaty - the Montreal Protocol - when governments meet in Kigali, Rwanda in October.The amendment is aimed at managing down the use of climate-damaging Hydroflurocarbons (HFCs) that are now being used in refrigeration systems such as air conditioners. The two countries said they wanted to secure not only an internationally-agreed phase-down of HFCs but an early \u2018freeze\u2019 date so that the phase-down starts sooner rather than later.They also announced backing for action on aviation emissions under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at its meeting later this month. Under ICAO, governments will decide whether to agree a market-based mechanism that can assist in encouraging aircraft operators to bring down greenhouse gases from planes.China and the United States said that they plan to be early participants in a voluntary pilot phase if the decision goes through at the ICAO conference.\u201cI would like to commend China and the US for these two additional announcements. While the Paris Agreement is the main vehicle for action on climate change, it is clear that all international agreements need to work in tandem in order to realize our shared goals and aims,\u201d said Patricia Espinosa.The new announcements by China and the US come ahead of the next round of UN climate negotiations - known as COP22 - which is to be held in Marrakech, Morocco in November.

VIndia is likely to come under increasing international pressure on climate change after China and US ratified the Paris Agreement on the eve of the 11th G20 Summit, with Beijing reiterating its pledge to tackle the issue that is bringing about irreversible changes to the world\u2019s environment.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust as I believe the Paris agreement will ultimately prove to be a turning point for our planet, I believe that history will judge today\u2019s efforts as pivotal,\u201d US President Obama said here after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping handed their respective ratified documents to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is. And when it comes to combating climate change, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Both the United States and China, we\u2019re leading by example,\u201d Obama said.\u000a\u000aXi said the joint action \u201cspeaks to the shared ambition and resolve of China and the United States in addressing global issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), had ratified the document on Saturday at its meeting in Beijing.\u000a\u000a\u201cRatifying the agreement accords with China\u2019s policy of actively dealing with climate change,\u201d official news agency Xinhua quoted the proposal a saying, adding that addressing climate change would help the country realize sustainable development.\u000a\u000aThe ratification will \u201cfurther advance China\u2019s green, low-carbon development and safeguard environmental security,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to the Indian media on Saturday, Niti Ayog chairperson Arvind Panagariya, who is here for the Summit, said India is not expected to ratify the agreement any time soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not yet sure when\u2026we will not do it by 2016,\u201d he said, adding that every country has its own domestic procedures to complete before ratifying international agreements.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe most difficult contentious issue this time ended up being climate change. Ratification done by enough countries this year so that agreement comes into force this year. My stand is, we could not commit for 2016.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn India\u2019s insistence, \u201clifestyle changes\u201d will be added in the joint communique at the end of the Summit, Panagaria said, pointing out that simple things like postponing switching on central heating in countries where it is used could contribute in tackling climate change.\u000a\u000aThe Xinhua report said: \u201cVice Premier Zhang Gaoli, the special envoy of President Xi Jinping, signed the document and announced that China aimed to finalise domestic legal procedures to ratify the pact before the G20 summit in Hangzhou.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina has committed to reduce its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% by 2030 from 2005 levels, increase non-fossil fuel sources in primary energy consumption to about 20%, and peak its carbon emissions by 2030.\u000a\u000aChina and India had issued a joint statement during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the country in May 2015, signaling a convergence of views on climate change and pressing developed countries to take the lead in the problem.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe two sides urged the developed countries to raise their pre-2020 emission reduction targets and honour their commitment to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to developing countries,\u201d the statement had said.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina and India are undertaking ambitious actions domestically on combating climate change ... despite the enormous scale of their challenges in terms of social and economic development and poverty eradication,\u201d it added.

VCreating the Atlantic Ocean's first is a needed response to dangerous climate change, oceanic dead zones and unsustainable fishing practises, President said today.\u000a\u000aThe new Northeast Canyons and Seamounts consists of nearly 5,000 square miles of underwater canyons and mountains off the New England coast.\u000a\u000aIt's the 27th time that Obama has created or enlarged a national monument.\u000a\u000a"If we're going to leave our children with oceans like the ones that were left to us, then we're going to have to act and we're going to have to act boldly," Obama said at a State Department conference.\u000a\u000aMore than 20 countries represented at the meeting were also announcing the creation of their own marine protected areas. Monument designations come with restrictions on certain activities.\u000a\u000aThe White House said the designation will lead to a ban on commercial fishing, mining and drilling, though a seven-year exception will occur for the lobster and red crab industries.\u000a\u000aOthers, such as whiting and squid harvesters, have 60 days to transition out. Recreational fishing will be allowed within the monument.\u000a\u000aSupporters of the new monument say protecting large swaths of ocean from human stresses can sustain important species and reduce the toll of\u000a\u000aFishermen worry it will become harder for them to earn a living as a result of Obama's move.\u000a\u000a"This is deplorable," said Grant Moore, president of the Atlantic Offshore Lobstermen's Association, in describing the designation.\u000a\u000aWhite House officials said the administration listened to industry's concerns, and noted the monument is smaller than originally proposed and contains a transition period for companies.\u000a\u000aObama said helping oceans become more resilient to will help fishermen.\u000a\u000aJon Williams, president of the in New Bedford, Massachusetts, said his company will survive, but the changes designed to address some of the industry's concerns don't sway him about the merits of the monument.\u000a\u000a"We've been fishing out there for 35 years," Williams said. "It's a big blow to us."\u000a\u000aObama said the world was asking too much of its oceans. He said the investments the US and other nations were taking with new marine protected areas were vital for their economy and national security, but "also vital to our spirit."\u000a\u000aHe noted that he had spent his own childhood looking out over the ocean shores and being humbled by the endless expanse.\u000a\u000a"I know that in a contest between us and the oceans, eventually the oceans will win one way or the other," he said.\u000a\u000a"So it's up to us to adapt, not the other way around.

VMANGALURU: Fate of most natural low lands across the world such as Bangladesh and Male hinges on resolve of parties to adhere to Paris Agreement, an agreement on Climate Change.The Paris Agreement deals with greenhouse gases emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in 2020, noted M R Madhav , professor emeritus, JNT University and visiting professor, IIT, Hyderabad.In his address at the inauguration of 10th International Symposium on Lowland Technology (ISLT) organized by the International Association of Lowland Technology (IALT) and department of civil engineering, NITK , Surathkal, Madhav, said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the sea level could rise by 0.5 metres in next 50-years. This will threaten existence of Bangladesh, Male and a good part of Krishna- Godavari basin.Madhav, who also heads the IALT, said, the IPCC forecast is based on future scenario for climate change based on global warming and other factors. A lot of this can be mitigated if parties to the Paris Agreement remain true to it, he said. Else, salt water intrusion, and wave action will wreak havoc on the natural lowlands including Sundarbans in West Bengal , which is already shrinking on account of erosion, and this situation could only be hastened, he warned.With pressure on land growing, Madhav, said the future development of humanity will be on reclaimed land. The challenge of an event such as ISLT is to ensure sustainability and development of reclaimed land to foster human development, he said. This is the reason that the Paris Agreement is laying greater emphasis on reducing greenhouse gases emission and switch to green energy such as solar and wind, which countries like Germany, Denmark are already doing.Large scale decimation of natural rain forest in Brazil which accounts for nearly 40-50% of world's natural oxygen supply is also a cause for concern, Madhav said given the rise in greenhouse gases emission. Bhutan is the only nation in the world that is Carbon negative and efforts should be made to address these issues to ensure sustainability of lowland areas. Nobo Mishima, professor, SAKA University, Japan inaugurated ISLT. K N Lokesh, director, NITK, presided.

VEarlier this week, Washington Post published a piece on the violence in Karnataka over the sharing of the Cauvery waters with Tamil Nadu. It asked a simple but a critical question: Indians are rioting over water. Is this a glimpse into the future?\u000a\u000aYes, it is.\u000a\u000aThis round of violence over the Cauvery waters got prime-time attention because it happened in Bangalore, India\u2019s swish info-tech hub. But there are several low-intensity water wars happening across the country, and some may also go out of hand, if they are not tackled now. Unfortunately, many such skirmishes/battles over water go unnoticed because they take place in rural areas.\u000a\u000aRead: Cauvery cocktail: River dispute exposes Karnataka, Tamil Nadu fault lines\u000a\u000aIn June, I was in Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh, a perennially water-starved district in the Bundelkhand region. In one of the villages, I met Shankar, a farmer. \u201cLast night, people from our neighbouring village stole our water,\u201d he said angrily.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey brought their cattle to our water tank\u2026 we will take this up with their panchayat leaders because we hardly have water left for our cattle. Ours tank is the last source of water in this area,\u201d he explained.\u000a\u000aRead: Cauvery water wars: 5 reasons why Karnataka is upset with SC order\u000a\u000aVillagers have now decided to take turns to guard the tank at night.\u000a\u000aShankar\u2019s neigbour Arvind did not mince words: \u201cThere will be violence if they don\u2019t listen to us\u201d.\u000a\u000aExperts say that water wars will become a norm in India due to climate change. Rainfall is expected to increase with greater variability, which could mean more droughts and floods. The Post report mentions a 2013 study by Princeton University and the University of California at Berkeley that looked at 60 case studies on climate change and found \u201cstrong causal evidence\u201d linking climate events to human conflicts. For each standard deviation in change in climate toward warmer temperatures or extreme rainfall, the authors showed, the frequency of interpersonal violence rose 4% and intergroup conflict rose 14%.\u000a\u000aRead: Don\u2019t blame nature for the drought in Bundelkhand\u000a\u000aMore evidence comes from the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJOLT), which aims to map 2,500 environmental conflicts and injustices by the end of 2017: It shows that more than 200 conflicts in India are caused by ecological disputes and scarcities of basic resources such as water and forests.\u000a\u000a\u201cConflicts related to water management appear highest in India with 59 cases, followed by conflicts in fossil fuels and climate justice category with 47 cases and the industrial and utilities conflicts category with 36 cases,\u201d VV Krishna, EJOLT project director and professor at the Centre for Studies in Science Policy at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said in a recent interview.\u000a\u000aRead: The water mafia is sucking India dry\u000a\u000aSpeaking to HT on the Cauvery water conflict, KJ Joy, who co-edited Water Conflicts in India: A Million Revolts in the Making, said that Cauvery-type water wars break out also because tribunals (including the Cauvery Tribunal) don\u2019t give a \u201cclear direction as how to share during shortages and also institutional mechanisms to deal with it\u201d.\u000a\u000aVery often conflicts over sharing of water arise in distress years. And then this is exploited by identity-based organisations. \u201cBoth Karnataka and Tamil Nadu should have foreseen the situation arising out of the Supreme Court verdict on September 5 and taken preventive steps,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThese conflicts also arise because there is lack of real time data, leaving room for rumour-mongering. \u201cOnly now there seems to be a directive to the Central Water Commission to put real time hydrological data on the public domain,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAs India firefights the Cauvery issue, a similar conflict is brewing over the Mahandi waters between in Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Chhattisgarh government had proposed constructing more than a dozen barrages on the Mahanadi. Odisha fears that such projects would hamper water flow into the Hirakund dam built on the river that originates in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Dhamtari district.\u000a\u000aRead: Shifting IPL matches or good rains won\u2019t end our water woes. Here\u2019s why\u000a\u000aThen there is Andhra Pradesh and Telangana jousting over the Krishna and Godavari waters (one of the important issues underpinning the demand for a separate state had been water), and Punjab, Haryana and Delhi over the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal. Add to this is Karnataka and Goa\u2019s fight over the sharing of the Mahadayi river waters.\u000a\u000aIf rivers have become source of conflicts, so have dams. There have been the strong protests against the Sardar Sarovar Project and the Polavaram dam. Similar protests have been seen in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. Other categories of water conflict include the one between industry and agrarian sector; water pollution and privatisation of the critical resource.\u000a\u000aThere is a virtual institutional vacuum in deal with micro watershed, sub-basins and basins in negotiated settlements around water allocation, and for conflict resolution. Though the different water polices have been talking about river basin organisations there is nothing on the ground.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is all the more important in the case of inter-state water conflicts \u2013 we need institutions that cut across administrative/political boundaries and can engage with the sub-basins and basins as integrated hydrological entities. In fact we need democratic, multi-stakeholder platforms for every sub-basin and basins in the country which are legally mandated,\u201d said Joy.\u000a\u000aParadoxically, India has been able to resolve, at least to some extent, some of the trans-boundary conflicts with its neighbours. For example, despite all the tensions, the Indus Water Treaty still functions. There are occasional problems, but they are sorted out through discussion and dialogue.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the same cannot be said about inter-state water conflicts.\u000a\u000aProbably that\u2019s what promoted some years ago Priyaranjan Das Munshi, former Union minster for water resources, to say: \u201cI am not a minister for water resources, but for water conflicts\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe author tweets at @kumkumdasgupta.

VNEW DELHI: Environment ministry on Thursday announced an ambitious collaborative R&D programme to develop next generation sustainable refrigerant technologies as alternatives to the climate-damaging hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).The announcement came a day before the International Ozone Day. Though HFC is not an ozone-depleting chemical substance like other refrigerants, it has huge potential to damage climate and therefore its phase down is considered quite important to fight the adverse impact of climate change.The announcement indicates India's commitment to phase down HFCs by taking its domestic industries on board so that the refrigerant sector does not get affected by it until they find cost-effective cutting edge technology as alternative to HFC which is used in air-conditioners, refrigerators and insulating foam.Countries from across the globe, including India, will next month meet in Kigali , Rwanda to finalise an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs.Amendment to the Montreal Protocol is needed as it, in its present form, only deals with phasing down of ozone-depleting refrigerants like CFCs and HCFCs. Since HFC is not ozone-depleting chemical substance, its phase down under Montreal Protocol requires the amendment.The move is expected to help the world cut down emission of this dangerous greenhouse gas substantially by 2050 and avoid up to 0.5 degree Celsius of warming by the end of the 21st century.The research initiative to find out alternatives to HFCs in India will be led by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research's (CSIR)Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad.Besides CSIR and its allied institution, the Centre for Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences and key industry players in the refrigerant sector will also be part of this R&D initiative.The ministry along with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the CSIR has also decided to create a corpus fund for this research programme. Industry also committed to contribute to the effort."With this initiative, India reaffirms its commitment to working with all other nations to safeguard the Earth\u2019s natural ecosystem", said the environment ministry while making the announcement on Thursday.Members of this initiative have already had multiple rounds of consultation to reach a consensus on the contours and the roadmap for this initiative.The ministry said, "India has a small carbon footprint at citizen level and its sustainable lifestyle results in low contribution of the country to overall emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, as compared with other developed countries. However, there is an urgent need for developing new technologies indigenously as alternatives available today are patented apart from being expensive."The research based programme to look for cost effective alternatives to the currently used regfrigerant gases is, therefore essential. The initiative is a significant step forward in line with India\u2019s national focus on research, innovation, technology development and Mission Innovation".By establishing an effective collaboration between all important stakeholders, the initiative is focused on prioritising areas of research in new refrigerant technologies and natural refrigerants."This will help the country leapfrog from the current high global warming potential HFCs to technologies with lower climate impact", said the ministry -- an indication that India will be able to move on the HFCs' 'phase down' path quickly only if it gets alternative either through domestic innovation or through getting cost-effective solution from the developed countries.It reiterated that the proposed R&D initiative is an important step in the direction of enabling the country achieve national development goals, while continuing to maintain a sustainable environmental footprint.Reversing its long opposition, India had in April last year made a formal proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol to bring phasing down of HFC. The country had, however, sought a "grace period" of 15 years to phase down HFCs so that its domestic industries get enough time to switch over to technically feasible and economically viable alternatives.If the grace period is accepted in Kigali, developing countries will phase down the refrigerant to an agreed level by 2050 as against the deadline of 2035 for rich nations including the US, Japan and EU countries.The amendment, once adopted, will make all developing countries, including India, compulsorily phase down HFC under the Montreal Protocol which, at present, does not have a mandate to deal with the non-ozone depleting

Industry also committed to contribute to the effort."With this initiative, India reaffirms its commitment to working with all other nations to safeguard the Earth\u2019s natural ecosystem", said the environment ministry while making the announcement on Thursday.Members of this initiative have already had multiple rounds of consultation to reach a consensus on the contours and the roadmap for this initiative.The ministry said, "India has a small carbon footprint at citizen level and its sustainable lifestyle results in low contribution of the country to overall emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, as compared with other developed countries. However, there is an urgent need for developing new technologies indigenously as alternatives available today are patented apart from being expensive."The research based programme to look for cost effective alternatives to the currently used regfrigerant gases is, therefore essential. The initiative is a significant step forward in line with India\u2019s national focus on research, innovation, technology development and Mission Innovation".By establishing an effective collaboration between all important stakeholders, the initiative is focused on prioritising areas of research in new refrigerant technologies and natural refrigerants."This will help the country leapfrog from the current high global warming potential HFCs to technologies with lower climate impact", said the ministry -- an indication that India will be able to move on the HFCs' 'phase down' path quickly only if it gets alternative either through domestic innovation or through getting cost-effective solution from the developed countries.It reiterated that the proposed R&D initiative is an important step in the direction of enabling the country achieve national development goals, while continuing to maintain a sustainable environmental footprint.Reversing its long opposition, India had in April last year made a formal proposal to amend the Montreal Protocol to bring phasing down of HFC. The country had, however, sought a "grace period" of 15 years to phase down HFCs so that its domestic industries get enough time to switch over to technically feasible and economically viable alternatives.If the grace period is accepted in Kigali, developing countries will phase down the refrigerant to an agreed level by 2050 as against the deadline of 2035 for rich nations including the US, Japan and EU countries.The amendment, once adopted, will make all developing countries, including India, compulsorily phase down HFC under the Montreal Protocol which, at present, does not have a mandate to deal with the non-ozone depleting

VOn 2 October a year ago, India moved to allay any international scepticism about its commitment to combating climate change by announcing its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). India is to reduce the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005 levels, it said in an announcement. Now, by agreeing to ratify the Paris Agreement\u2014which aims to contain the increase in earth\u2019s temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, and if possible 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels\u2014on the same day this year, India will move further along this path. It\u2019s a hurried move\u2014but because of diplomatic compulsions, New Delhi has chosen to couch pragmatism in the symbolism of Gandhi\u2019s birth anniversary.\u000a\u000aThe Paris agreement\u2014which materialized at the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2014requires 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to ratify it in order for it to come into force. New Delhi had gone slow so far\u2014but with the threshold likely to be reached without it in October, and the possibility thereafter of being cast in an obstructionist role diplomatically, it has understandably changed track.\u000a\u000aBut India still has good reason to be wary at the negotiating table because of three reasons. First, too much focus on incremental pollution by developing countries shifts the public attention away from the historical damage done by the developed countries during their years of rapid economic growth. Second, the per capita carbon footprint of India is still very low by global standards. Third, India needs coal as part of its energy mix right now, until new technologies emerge.\u000a\u000aBy retaining the \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d clause in the Paris Agreement, the world has acknowledged Indian concerns. However, as Shyam Saran, India\u2019s former foreign secretary and the prime minister\u2019s special envoy for climate change from 2007-10, points out in an article in The Indian Express last year, doing away with the distinction between developing and developed nations dilutes the differentiation principle\u2014which puts the onus on developed countries to take greater responsibility for reducing emissions. Undue pressure is already being exerted on India as one of the largest polluters of the world. Though third in terms of total emissions, it ranks 140th globally in terms of per capita emissions.\u000a\u000aHowever, with its large coastline susceptible to rising sea levels and a population suffering from the visible consequences of climate change, such as heat waves, pollution and failed monsoons, the country couldn\u2019t have argued for its rights to development beyond a point. It therefore made a calculated choice considering its long-term costs. It embraced the cause of climate change but with a caveat\u2014the availability of global finance and performance of other nations. The cabinet decision, which came on Wednesday, implicitly emphasizes that the onus is on developed nations to fund and transfer technology to developing nations, besides making efforts to meet their domestic commitments.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s strategy for combating climate change and achieving INDC targets is a multi-pronged one.\u000a\u000aIt aims at modifying the energy mix to a more sustainable, efficient and renewable one. Its ambitious solar plan\u2014to expand solar capacity to 100 GW by 2022 from 8 GW in 2016, which incurred the ire of the US and eventually the World Trade Organization due to the priority it gave to domestic producers, is expected to make up almost 48% of the renewable energy capacity. The International Solar Alliance and the recently unveiled plan to subsidize domestic manufacturers will help but can only be sustained by a higher inflow of funds for solar projects.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the renewable energy capacity would be developed through a mixture of wind power, hydropower, biomass, waste to energy and nuclear power. Nuclear energy will form less than 4% of these clean energy commitments. Though it is unlikely that India\u2019s non-membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group will significantly affect its plans, the membership could have enhanced it.\u000a\u000aA significant challenge to these plans remains, as pointed out by India\u2019s chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, last year, the fall in oil prices, which increases the opportunity cost of expansion of alternative energy sources. The country has dealt with the problem by imposing taxes on petroleum products. As opposed to the cap and trade system proposed by countries such as China, India uses Piguovian taxes as the alternative market approach to limiting emissions. But the issue of renewable energy being less competitive still persists.\u000a\u000aBesides dealing with the problem at source, the country is also making efforts to bring down current greenhouse gas levels through the development of carbon sinks. However, this might prove to be a difficult task considering the land-scarcity problem. The Fourteenth Finance Commission made forest cover one of the criteria for devolution of funds from the Centre to incentivize states to engage in afforestation activities. It is estimated that around $6.9 billion will be transferred to states.\u000a\u000aA 33-35% reduction in emission targets is not an unattainable one, if all these efforts come through. But that would require persistent efforts from both the global community and the Indian government. A clear vision of what the alternative would mean for the country and the world at large should help in sustaining these efforts.\u000a\u000aDo you think India will be able to meet the nationally determined contributions it has committed to?

VIndia's ratification of the Paris Climate Change agreement moves the world an "important step closer" towards achieving the goal of entering the landmark deal into force this year, UN chief Ban Ki-moon said.\u000a\u000aThe UN Secretary General said there is no better way to commemorate and his legacy for people and planet as will submit its instrument of ratification to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on October 2, Gandhi's birth anniversary.\u000a\u000a"I warmly congratulate for its climate leadership, and for building on the strong momentum we see from all corners of the globe for the agreement to enter into force as quickly as possible this year. India's ratification of the agreement moves the world an important step closer toward achieving that goal," Ban said in his message on the International Day of Non-violence, to be observed onOctober 2.\u000a\u000aThe UN Chief said that every year on the International Day of non-violence, the world body recommits itself to the cause of peace, as exemplified by the life of who was born on this day 147years ago.\u000a\u000a"In all he did, Gandhi honoured our obligation to all living things. He reminded us that 'Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone's needs, but not everyone's greed'.Gandhi also challenged us to 'be the change we wish to see in the world'," Ban said.\u000a\u000aHe said the commitment to sustainable living that Gandhi emphasised on is reflected in a "momentous way" as is depositing its instrument of ratification to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\u000a\u000a"What better way to commemorate and his legacy for people and planet," he said.\u000a\u000a"We know that a culture of non-violence begins with respect for others, but it does not end there. To nurture peace, we must respect nature. I am pleased this year's International Day of Non-violence puts the focus on sustainability and the environment," the UN Chief said.\u000a\u000aBan called on all countries to complete their domestic processes for ratification and also strive in all activities to achieve progress through non-violence.\u000a\u000aThe UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on the Agenda for Sustainable Development David Nabarro also said the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change signed by world leaders this April is closer to entering into force, as India - a country that produces more than four per cent of global emissions - plans to submit its ratification at the end of the week.\u000a\u000aAdopted in Paris by the 195 Parties to the UN\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFramework Convention on Climate Change at a conference last December, the Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future, as well as to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, it seeks to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u000a\u000aThe pact - which was signed in New York in April by 175 countries at the largest, single-day signing ceremony in history - will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification.\u000a\u000aDuring the UN General Assembly's general debate this past week, 32 more countries deposited their instruments of ratification for the Agreement, bringing the total to 61 countries that have formally joined the pact, and officially crossing one of the two thresholds required to bring it into force.\u000a\u000aThose 61 countries together represent 47.79 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aFollowing the announcement regarding India, formal approval from countries representing slightly more than three per cent in global emissions is still needed.\u000a\u000aIn early September, the world's two largest emitters, China and the US, joined the agreement.\u000a\u000aNabarro expressed confidence that the Agreement will enter into force at some point this year, highlighting that at least 14 other countries, representing at least 12 per cent of global emissions, have committed to ratifying the pact.\u000a\u000a"There's a kind of race going on now, for countries to come in there and make sure that they are part of the ratification community - to show that they are part of wanting to get the Agreement into force," he said.

VOver Rs3,00,000 crore \u201cis being wasted\u201d by India on building an additional 62GW of coal power plants that will remain idle due to huge overcapacity in the power sector, Greenpeace India said on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe environmental group asserted that the \u201cunjustified\u201d expansion plans pose a \u201cthreat\u201d to the country\u2019s commitments to climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith India\u2019s Cabinet signalling readiness to ratify the Paris agreement on climate change, Greenpeace India is highlighting the threat posed to these commitments as well as to the economy, in particular the energy and banking sectors by the unnecessary and unjustified plans for coal expansion.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia is making laudable progress towards its clean energy commitments, installing 175GW of solar and wind power, and looking to attract multi-billion dollar investments in the renewable sector.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the same time, Greenpeace\u2019s analysis shows that over Rs 3,00,000 crore (close to $50 billion) is being wasted on building an additional 62GW of coal power plants, which will remain idle due to huge overcapacity in the power sector,\u201d it said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe threat of excess coal power comes even as the sector has already seen plant load factors (PLF) drop to 62% in 2015-16, and as low as 54% in July, 2016, leading to under-recoveries and financial distress, it said.\u000a\u000aThe green body said that at least 31GW of coal power plants are currently idle and stranded due to a lack of coal supply or purchasing agreements with state discoms.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is clear that there is no need for any additional coal power till 2022 at least, and probably beyond that too, even if we work with the governments own estimates of 6.7% per annum growth in electricity demand (based on a projected GDP growth of 8.3 per cent).\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd yet, to continue building, at enormous expense, an additional 65GW of coal plants that will not be utilised, is shocking evidence of poor planning in the infrastructure sector. In effect, 94 per cent of the coal power capacity that is currently being built will be lying idle,\u201d said Jai Krishna, research consultant for Greenpeace India.\u000a\u000aGreenpeace India said that in addition to 65 GW of coal power under construction, there are an estimated additional 178 GW of coal power plants at various stages in the permitting process.\u000a\u000aIf even a fraction of this gets built, the overcapacity problem in the power sector will be magnified and this has follow-on implications for the banking sector with the risk of further growth in Non-Performing Assets, it said.

VIn the race to account for how carbon moves through Arctic ecosystems, especially as they warm, scientists may be overlooking one major component: river flood plains.\u000a\u000aA preliminary study of 10 Arctic rivers suggests that they cycle roughly three to seven times more carbon through their flood plains than eventually exits the river into the ocean, says Joel Rowland, a geomorphologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe fate of that flood plain carbon isn\u2019t known.

VIn the race to account for how carbon moves through Arctic ecosystems, especially as they warm, scientists may be overlooking one major component: river flood plains.\u000a\u000aA preliminary study of 10 Arctic rivers suggests that they cycle roughly three to seven times more carbon through their flood plains than eventually exits the river into the ocean, says Joel Rowland, a geomorphologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe fate of that flood plain carbon isn\u2019t known. It may be respired into the atmosphere, or be redeposited on riverbanks farther downstream.

VCountries came to an agreement in Kigali on Saturday to phase out a family of potent greenhouse gases by the late 2040s and move to prevent a potential 0.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperature by the end of the century.\u000a\u000aHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are a family of greenhouse gases that are largely used in refrigerants in home and car air-conditioners. They are currently the world\u2019s fastest growing greenhouse gases, with emissions increasing by up to 10 per cent each year. They are one of the most powerful, trapping thousands of times more heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2).\u000a\u000aIn all, 197 countries, including India, China and the United States, agreed on Saturday to a timeline to reduce the use of HFCs by roughly 85 per cent of their baselines by 2045.\u000a\u000aThe agreement is significant in that it amends the 1987 Montreal Protocol, initially conceived only to plug gases that were destroying the ozone layer, to now include gases responsible for global warming. This has been the turf of agreements such as the recently ratified Paris agreement that pushes countries to cap global warming to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d by 2100.\u000a\u000aAs per Saturday\u2019s agreement in Kigali, all countries are in one of three groups with different timelines to go about these reductions. The richest countries, including the U.S. and those in the European Union, will freeze the production and consumption of HFCs by 2018, reducing them to about 15 per cent of 2012 levels by 2036. China, Brazil and all of Africa, will freeze HFC use by 2024, cutting it to 20 percent of 2021 levels by 2045.\u000a\u000aIndia is part of a group that will only be freezing HFC use by 2028 and reducing it to about 15 per cent of 2025 levels by 2047.\u000a\u000aThis however hasn\u2019t been explicitly spelt out by India\u2019s negotiators. In a press statement, Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave only said \u201cWe were flexible, accommodative and ambitious. The world is one family and as a responsible member of the global family, we played our part to support and nurture this agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike the more glamorous Paris agreement that will come into force by 2020 and doesn\u2019t legally bind countries to their promises to cut emissions, the amended Montreal Protocol will bind countries to their HFC reduction schedules from 2019. There are also penalties for non-compliance as well as clear directives that developed countries provide enhanced funding support estimated at billions of dollars globally. The exact amount of additional funding will be agreed at the next Meeting of the Parties in Montreal, in 2017. Grants for research and development of affordable alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons will be the most immediate priority.\u000a\u000aThe details of this will be worked out in subsequent meetings of the countries committed to the Montreal Protocol agreement.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia gets to participate in a positive global climate action, while gaining time to allow its heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sectors to grow and refrigerant manufacturers to find a comfortable route to transition and cost of alternatives to fall,\u201d said Lekha Sridhar, a policy analyst with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water.\u000a\u000aAnalysts feel Kigali agreement is fair to the realities of India\u2019s future economic development

VJodhpur: Dantiwara , a model village for organic agriculture will witness throwing of hats by the ex-servicemen in the agricultural ring to ensure food security in the country. Not only they themselves will take initiative into organic farming but will also motivate others to adopt the organic agriculture on the World Food Security Day on Sunday.Scientist from Central Arid Zone Research Centre (CAZRI) Arum Kumar Sharma said that organic agriculture is the only way out to address the ill-effects of the global warming by increasing the soil carbon and elimination of Nitrus Oxide, which is produced from the use of Urea and DAP fertilisers. "During our eight years intensive research at CAZRI organic farm, which is a certified organic farm, we have come to an unequivocal conclusion that the organic agriculture is the panacea of all the ill-effects caused by the use of the chemical fertilisers and pesticides and in increasing the soil health as well as the tolerance of the crop", he said.He said that the vast stretches of desert offered an ideal condition for promotion of the organic farming as this land here was still protected from the negative impacts of these chemicals and would be fast adapted to the practices of the organic farming.Adding to him, Regional Organic head of the Bhartiya Kissan Sangh, Tulcha Ram said that the interest of the farmers has gradually been growing in organic practices of farming. "Consistent use of chemicals in the form of fertilisers and pesticides had not only reduced the potency of the soil considerably but has also cost them their health as well as money", he said.According to Sharma, if the second Green Revolution has to be brought in, focus would have to be shifted to organic practices from the chemical farming by focussing on 60% dryland, which we have today.Till now, about 400 bigha agricultural land in Dantiwara has been put under Organic farming practices through constant motivation and assistance to the farmers and the crop, which have been promoted here includes moong, bazar and til predominantly."Gradually, we were looking forward to bring entire agriculture land of Dantiwara under the fold of Organci Farming and then present as the model village for others to visit and experience the benefits", Sharma said.

VThe European Union\u2019s ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement has nudged it beyond the required threshold \u2014 ratification by more than 55 Parties to the Convention accounting for at least 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This will ensure that the Agreement will enter into force, or become part of international law, on November 4, 2016. Many leaders have praised the speed at which the ratification process moved forward. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said that she viewed this accelerated process as an expression of the importance that countries attach to climate change.\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement, in contrast with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, makes all countries responsible for reducing GHGs instead of just the rich or Annex-1 countries, which are responsible for the bulk of the total GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Individual countries are now responsible for implementing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), goals that each country developed and submitted to the UNFCCC before the Paris Conference of Parties (COP) last December. Most of the pledges, including India\u2019s, are partly or entirely conditional on financial support for their implementation.\u000a\u000aSupport for building capacity\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe thorny question that remains is , what are the implications for an agreement that enters into force without the support needed to implement it? Rich countries are supposed to make available $100 billion annually by 2020 for climate-related projects in poor countries. There is little sign of any significant progress towards this goal. We are therefore at a point where support for building capacity to achieve the NDC goals requires the same level of international pressure and enthusiasm that was demonstrated in ratifying the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aThe governing body of the Paris Agreement will hold its first meeting at the COP in Marrakech in November 2016. This is referred to as the Meeting of theParties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). In fact, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) still has a number of tasks ahead of it for implementing the Agreement. The APA has been mandated to prepare for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement and also for convening the CMA.\u000a\u000aCoincidentally, another big news wasannounced recently: the earth\u2019s atmosphere has exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide (CO2).CO2 concentrations have been steadily going upward since humans began removing fuel from below the ground and using it to fire up the industrial revolution. There are small annual fluctuations in these concentrations, which are usually at their lowest after the summer as vegetation in the Northern hemisphere absorbs the atmospheric gas. In autumn, as leaves fall, the CO2 levels begin to increase.\u000a\u000aOver the past few years, several places in the world have recorded concentrations above 400 ppm, but this September, when concentrations should generally be lowest for the year, the values have remained above 400 ppm; the world as we know it has changed indefinitely. The scientific community has generally regarded a GHG concentration of 350-400 ppm as the maximum level needed for a safe climate. James Hansen from Columbia University wrote nearly a decade ago: \u201cPaleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that.\u201d Other scientists have in the past suggested that 400 ppm be treated as a safe threshold, but also note that the last time the earth\u2019s atmosphere saw such concentrations was over two million years ago, when sea levels were 6 metres higher than they are today.\u000a\u000aNo matter what the magic figure, these higher concentrations of CO2 and other GHGs are trapping more heat and we are getting close to average warming by 1.5C over pre-industrial levels. A group of seven leading scientists produced a brief report in September this year called \u201cThe Truth about Climate Change.\u201d They explained that with the high levels of GHGs already in the atmosphere and the slow but perceptible response of the climate system, we can expect average global temperatures to rise by 1.5C in the 2030s and cross 2C as early as 2050, which is well within the lifetime of many people alive today. The current NDC pledges made by the countries of the world, as ambitious as some of them are, will not be sufficient to put us below the 2C target.\u000a\u000aTransformational change\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGiven the enormous scale of the challenge, it has become clear to many who have been working for long in the domain that tinkering at the edges to tackle climate change will be inadequate. What is needed is a significant shift in human behaviour and economic systems, which are closely tied with atmospheric systems and the future of our planet. In other words, a transformational change, a system-wide modification in social, economic and technological institutions will be necessary.\u000a\u000aCurrently, about 82 per cent of the world\u2019s energy comes from burning fossil fuels. This is used in different sectors and entails the upstream production of electricity, petrol, diesel and other forms of usable energy. Improving efficiencies of energy production and use, and increasing the contribution from renewables are major improvements, but the world will have to go to \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions over the next few decades in order to avoid exceeding a 2C rise by mid-century or soon thereafter. These changes will need to take place while the lives of the poor in developing nations continue to improve, the world population increases, and we also adapt to living in a warmer world. In the last three years, global emissions, which were rising at around 4 per cent per year, have slowed to under 1 per cent growth, but it is both a scientific and social challenge to expect global emissions to peak very soon and go down to zero and remain there.\u000a\u000aThe dim source of light in this otherwise grim picture is that transformational change may in fact be taking place now in several small isolated communities around the world. These are eco-villages and transition towns (although they also go by other names) where renewables alone are used, people track all their emissions, and try to build communities while adopting simpler and less consumerist lifestyles.\u000a\u000aFurther, on October 15, a global agreement was reached to limit the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used mainly as refrigerants and are powerful GHGs. According to estimates, this agreement could help avoid about 0.4C warming until 2100. But HFCs are a small proportion of GHGs and broad change of the scale that is required severely tests our imagination. It is only possible if social movements, civil society organisations, legal systems and political leaders work together. Such single-minded purpose across nations rich and poor, weak and strong, is only possible if there is a sense of oneness, of global solidarity, to address climate change. Whether such transformation is possible in our lifetimes remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aSujatha Byravan is Principal Research Scientist at the Center for Study of Science, Technology & Policy, Bengaluru.

VPatna: Experts on Sunday said climate change was posing a threat to food security in the country.At a seminar on "Climate is changing: Food and agriculture must too", the experts said small farmers are largely affected by natural disasters like flood and drought. "Around 60% of the chronically hungry people in the world are women as per Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ," the experts said at the seminar which was organised by Bihar State Productivity Council (BSPC) to mark World Food Day on Sunday. Over 100 participants participated in the seminar, held on the campus of Bihar Industries Association.President of BSPC Sudhir Kumar Singh said climate change has also threatened the stability of food prices. "Variable temperatures threaten the stability of food prices. It may also result in significant decline in production of major crops, such as maize, wheat, rice and soybean. Innovation in the agricultural sector can go a long way in mitigating the effects of climate change on agriculture," Singh said.Ranjit Kumar Das, chief general manager of Nabard, said the organisation was working towards farm mechanization and empowering self-help groups to mitigate the effects of climate change. "To minimize the pressure on traditional crops, there should be a shift in dietary habits in India as it has happened in south-east Asian countries," Das added.Dr Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, Central University of South Bihar, rued government's failure to record environmental changes. "There should accurate mapping of the daily changes. Automatic weather stations (AWS) are operational in very few of the 38 districts in Bihar," he said, adding that AWS records temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind directions, sunshine, rainfall and evaporation. "Erratic uploading of information should be avoided. A dense network of AWS should be created and linked to weather-based crop insurance scheme and National Agriculture Insurance Scheme. Solar and wind power systems should be promoted to minimize the effects of climate change," he added.Somnath Bandyopadhyay, associate professor, School of Ecology and Environment Studies, Nalanda University, claimed that despite having the best alluvial soil, Bihar is lagging behind other states in terms of agricultural productivity. "A change in the climatic condition further exacerbates the condition of farmers who hardly have the expertise of modern methods of farming. The farmers should be trained in modern ways of farming to maximize yield," he added.

VFood loss and waste is an area in the food and agriculture sector where adaptations to climate change are important. Food loss and waste generates about 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aA recent study predicts that emissions associated with food waste could increase further. Hence, the message for World Food Day, observed on October 16, was that \u201cClimate is changing. Food and agriculture must too\u201d.\u000a\u000aNatural capital lost\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeeting the food needs of a growing population in India (1.7 billion by 2050) while reducing food loss and waste poses a serious challenge. Wasting a kilogram of wheat and rice would mean wasting 1,500 and 3,500 litres of water respectively that goes into their production.\u000a\u000aGlobally, almost 250km3 of water and 1.4 billion hectares of land are devoted to producing food that is lost or wasted.\u000a\u000aAccording to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), every year around 1.7 billion tonnes, or almost one third of food produced for human consumption, are lost or wasted globally.\u000a\u000aThe associated economic, environmental and social costs of this loss are around $1 trillion, $700 billion and $900 billion per year respectively.\u000a\u000aIn India, the value of food wastage (harvest and post-harvest losses of major agricultural produce) is estimated at around \u20b9 92,000 crore per annum at 2014 wholesale prices. In the food value chain, 24 per cent of global food loss and waste occurs at the production stage, 24 per cent during handling and storage, and 35 per cent at consumption.\u000a\u000aThese three stages taken together account for more than 80 per cent of global food loss and waste. Quantifying food waste along the value chain by leveraging the recently released UN Global Food Loss and Waste Protocol as a framework can help India.\u000a\u000aThe way out\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe following solutions can be envisaged for solving India\u2019s food waste problem.\u000a\u000aPrevention solutions: Upstream solutions include promotion of resource efficient and regenerative agricultural practices ( precision and organic agriculture); improved access to low-cost handling and storage technologies ( evaporative coolers, metal silos). Real time wireless sensors can monitor the storage conditions of perishable food as it is transported, and transmit this data to clients to alert them if things are going wrong.\u000a\u000aMega food parks are being commissioned in India to increase the processing of perishables. Other solutions include using active intelligent packaging for perishables; optimising food packaging; tapping businesses that buy unwanted food/produce directly from distributor/manufacturer for discounted retail sale; expansion of secondary markets for items with cosmetic damage; tray-less dining, encouraging sale of off-grade produce. Technology would be central to addressing food waste; but the ultimate success will depend on our readiness to change attitudes of stakeholders along the value chain.\u000a\u000aRecovery solutions: Approximately, a fifth of food at social events goes waste. Many city-based organisations are tackling this issue along with hunger. Some of these organisations collect excess food from parties and distribute it in slum areas.\u000a\u000aSome businesses are involved in value added processing, making healthy fruit snacks from surplus produce or donated food. Mobile apps are being developed for crowdsourcing data on hunger spots and which take requests for donation of excess food. Various community level initiatives like gleaning networks, food banks and social supermarkets can help in redistributing food to 184 million undernourished Indians in need; thus helping fight poverty.\u000a\u000aStaggering hunger\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThese steps are critical when India ranks lowly at 97 among 118 countries according to the 2016 Global Hunger Index. In US, the PATH Act of 2015 made permanent an enhanced tax deduction for donating food, increasing business incentives to involve in food recovery.\u000a\u000aItaly adopted a law that earmarked approximately $10 million to reduce one million tonnes of wasted food a year by offering incentives to businesses who donate food to charities, including $1.8 million annually to fund innovative food waste reduction projects, as well as $2.5 million to buy food for the poor.\u000a\u000aRecycling solution to manage food waste can include compost/energy/biogas production or redistribution and diversion as animal feed. Other uses can include organic manure and starch for household consumption.\u000a\u000aFood waste prevention is an integral part of the Europe\u2019s new package to stimulate its transition towards a circular economy, which will boost competitiveness, foster sustainable growth and generate new jobs.\u000a\u000aAssessing food loss and waste and developing effective policies along the value chain can help solve the food waste problem and thus contribute towards food security and sustainability. Wasting food going forward would tantamount to wasting a secure future.\u000a\u000aSmall but concentrated efforts against food waste are the need of the hour. Worldwide, 795 million people, or one-ninth of the global population, face hunger.\u000a\u000aIn India, we have 48 million or two in five children below the age of five affected by stunting. Transforming the food system in India will help to transform our future, as food waste includes wastage of natural capital.\u000a\u000aImplementing the right strategies will help halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels, and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.\u000a\u000aAchieving this target is crucial as it would reduce the number of hungry people and ease the pressure on natural capital. Setting up a network of food waste innovation incubators with dedicated support would help nurture innovations in reducing food loss and waste.\u000a\u000aSegregation of waste would be instrumental in accurately evaluating the impact of waste in key areas such as greenhouse gas and resource recovery.\u000a\u000aThe writer is Kuwait market leader for EY\u2019s Climate Change and Sustainability Services.

VPunjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh. PTI Photo Punjab Congress President Captain Amarinder Singh. PTI Photo\u000a\u000aFor the first time in Punjab, a party is set to release a green manifesto aimed specifically at addressing concerns of the environment. Increasing green cover, groundwater management, cleaning of rivers (mainly the Sutlej and Beas), eliminating stubble burning and providing straw management machinery to farmers on subsidized rates are some of the points that the Congress will seek to address.\u000a\u000aWatch what else is making news:\u000a\u000aApart from this, the party will also setup a separate Punjab State Environment Commission, a body which will be accountable to the government and work solely on environment issues in the state. Speaking to The Indian Express, Manpreet Badal, convenor of Congress\u2019 manifesto committee confirmed that the Green Manifesto will be released soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is probably for the first time in the country that a political party will come up with a Green Manifesto. For Congress, degrading environment, depleting groundwater and reducing forest cover of Punjab is one the biggest concerns. Our manifesto is the need of the hour and extremely crucial for Punjab. We have prepared a separate green agenda. No political party ever has come out clearly or stated any concrete plan when it comes to environment but Congress will be the first to do that,\u201d said Badal.\u000a\u000aThe party is yet to decide if the green manifesto will be launched separately or along with the main manifesto and gender manifesto, which too will be a separate document.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to The Indian Express, a senior party politician confirmed, \u201cA green manifesto is the a priority for Punjab. We are not releasing a it just for the sake of it like the AAP has served old things to the youth, farmers and industry till now. It is for the first time ever in Punjab elections that a party will focus on future generations, environment concerns, climate change and steps to solve the problem.\u201d\u000a\u000aExpected to be released in mid-November, the green manifesto will also include a plan to promote solar energy, measures to replenish depleting water table, reducing water wastage and will make State Environment Commission accountable to the government.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe commission is going to have teeth, it is not going to be a paper tiger. It will also coordinate with the industry stakeholders to reduce industrial pollution in Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindigarh, Jalandhar etc,\u201d said the senior politician. Also, the plan is to rope in leading environmentalists to join Congress\u2019 massive campaign against pollution and environmental degradation which it will be starting as part of its campaigning during the polls.\u000a\u000aIt was a unanimous decision to portray environment, pollution and forests conservation as one of the main agenda of the party for the Punjab polls, the party source added.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App

VThe older arctic ice is becoming weaker because there\u2019s less of it and the remaining old ice is more broken up and thinner, so that bulwark is not as good as it used to be. (Source: Reuters Photo/Representational) The older arctic ice is becoming weaker because there\u2019s less of it and the remaining old ice is more broken up and thinner, so that bulwark is not as good as it used to be. (Source: Reuters Photo/Representational)\u000a\u000aThe older, thicker layer of Arctic ice, which is most resistant to melting in summer, has shrunk alarmingly over the past decades, leaving the sea ice cap more vulnerable to global warming, according to NASA. Arctic sea ice, the vast sheath of frozen seawater floating on the Arctic Ocean and its neighbouring seas, has been hit with a double whammy over the past decades. As its extent shrunk, the oldest and thickest ice has either thinned or melted away, leaving the sea ice cap more vulnerable to the warming ocean and atmosphere, NASA said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the years is that the older ice is disappearing,\u201d said Walt Meier, a sea ice researcher at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Centre in the US. \u201cThis older, thicker ice is like the bulwark of sea ice: a warm summer will melt all the young, thin ice away but it can\u2019t completely get rid of the older ice,\u201d said Meier.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut this older ice is becoming weaker because there\u2019s less of it and the remaining old ice is more broken up and thinner, so that bulwark is not as good as it used to be,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aA new NASA visualisation of the age of Arctic sea ice shows how sea ice has been growing and shrinking, spinning, melting in place and drifting out of the Arctic for the past three decades.\u000a\u000aIn the early 2000s, scientists at the University of Colorado developed a way to monitor Arctic sea ice movement and the evolution of its age, primarily by using data satellite passive microwave instruments.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re keeping track of sea ice as it moves around, up until it melts in place or leaves the Arctic,\u201d said Meier, from University of Colorado. Every year, sea ice forms in the winter and melts in the summer.\u000a\u000aThe sea ice that survives the melt season thickens with each passing year: newly formed ice grows to about three to seven feet of thickness during its first year, while multi-year ice (sea ice that has survived several melt seasons) is about 10 to 13 feet thick.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App

VNAGPUR: The state government has decided to implement a Rs4,000 crore World Bank-aided project on climate resilient agriculture. The project will cover around 3,000 drought-prone villages in Marathwada and about 1,000 villages of Vidarbha, mainly the 894 located in saline belt of Amravati division. The project is to be executed in six years.To start with, the agriculture department by a government resolution issued on October 28, has set up a seven-member committee under the chairmanship of principal secretary (agriculture). The committee will now identify 3,000 villages in Marathwada and 1,000 in Vidarbha that will be the focus of the project. The programme aims to reduce farmers\u2019 dependence on unpredictable weather cycles and enhance resilience of agriculture to climate change and vulnerability through research and use of technology.The other members of the committee are Randhir Sawarkar (MLA from Akola west), vice-chancellors of Vasantrao Naik Agriculture University, Parbhani and Panjabrao Deshmukh Agriculture University, Akola, state agriculture commissioner and managing director of groundwater survey and development, Pune. Project director of the state weather-based agriculture project will be the member-secretary.\u201cMarathwada and Vidarbha regions have been at the receiving end of climatic variations. Erratic showers and heavy spells have damaged crops very often in the last few years,\u201d a senior officer of agriculture department said. While in Marathwada the villages will be selected from eight drought-hit districts, the five districts of Amravati division and Wardha in Nagpur district, basically the six farmer suicide-hit districts, could benefit from the project.In Amravati division, large areas in the Purna river valley covering Akola, Amravati and Buldhana districts are affected by saline ingress in agricultural lands, making farming a difficult proposition. Villages will be chosen by the committee on the basis of indicators like weather parameters, agriculture and social backwardness. A cluster approach with adaptability to watershed management will be considered. Various measures will be undertaken to fight drought and minimize impact of weather fluctuations.The project got in-principle approval on July 7. On August 10, a project management unit was set up to prepare an action plan with the approval for a staff of 23 to do the groundwork. At a final meeting under chairmanship of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , the project was given a go-ahead with the decision to implement it in 4,000 villages of Marathwada and Vidarbha. The idea is to insulate these villages from drought and weather aberrations.

VTokyo: Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs at least $100 billion more to finance country\u2019s goals for clean energy even after his government\u2019s policies brought in record investment in wind and solar power stations.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the conclusion of a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which found $10.5 billion flew into renewables in India for the fiscal year ended 31 March, almost 60% more than the $6.6 billion invested two years ago. It also said 7.3 gigawatts of clean-energy projects were built for the latest fiscal year, which is 71% higher than the previous period.\u000a\u000aThe findings represent the broadest assessment yet of the money going into India\u2019s clean-energy industry. Growth in the renewables business has helped India become the third-biggest power market in the world after China and the US, according to the BNEF report. Modi has set a goal of building 175 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2022 to supply more of the 62 million households that lack access to reliable grids and feed demand for electricity that\u2019s projected to rise fourfold by 2040.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s taking the right steps, but the targets are quite ambitious,\u201d said Shantanu Jaiswal, the lead author of the report at BNEF. \u201cThe question is where do people get the money\u2014$100 billion is a lot of money for this industry, especially given where we\u2019re starting from.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn investment of $100 billion is equivalent to almost 5% of all the goods and services produced annually by the nation of 1.3 billion people, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aDiversified financing\u000a\u000aThe report, sponsored by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a US non-profit working to mitigate climate change with renewable energy, was released at BNEF\u2019s conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. It also found that India has installed clean-energy capacity of 42.6 gigawatts. That accounts for 14% of the nation\u2019s total generation capacity, up from 12.5% three years ago.\u000a\u000aJaiswal said the nation needs to diversify its sources of finances to reach the goal, bringing in big international banks to complement the lending done by India\u2019s state-backed institutions and the development banks active in the country. It also needs to reduce the cost of debt financing for solar projects, which is more than double the rate charged in China and six times interest rates available in Japan, according to the report.\u000a\u000aState Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, along with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd, have helped supply much of the finance along with non-bank lenders such as Tata Cleantech Capital Ltd and L&T Finance Ltd. Development institutions include the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corp., the Asian Development Bank and KFW of Germany.\u000a\u000aThe huge capital needed to meet the targets, as well as the high cost of capital, mean that fundraising from the public markets will be critically important, according to the report. Along with green bonds, India is turning to infrastructure investment trusts, which are used to free up and recycle developers\u2019 capital stuck in operational projects by securitizing the revenue streams and offering the units on the public market.\u000a\u000aThe arrangement, expected to help the inflow of foreign capital and reduce the exposure of domestic financial institutions, was approved in September 2014 by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Infrastructure investment trusts are similar to yieldcos in helping developers combine multiple projects.\u000a\u000aTo create safeguards for investors in infrastructure investment trusts, regulators have set a requirement for a minimum number of independent directors in the investment management firm and have also placed restrictions on transactions done between related parties, according to the report.\u000a\u000aIndia also needs to improve on the management of power distribution companies, according to BNEF\u2019s Jaiswal.\u000a\u000a\u201cRight now, India\u2019s power distribution utilities are in huge debts, so they don\u2019t buy power even when there\u2019s demand,\u201d Jaiswal said.\u000a\u000aRetailers held total debt of almost Rs.4.1 trillion ($60 billion) at the end of March 2015, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said in August. That leaves the country\u2019s power plants running below capacity, while one in five people go without electricity. Bloomberg

VThe success of the Paris climate treaty, which has been covered in detail in these pages, is remarkable to the fullest degree. Given the complexities, vagaries and the lack of precision in cause-and-effect assessments of climate change, it took a Herculean effort to bring together 196 countries and have them all agree on a potential pathway to mitigate the problem. It was an effort 143 years in the making.\u000a\u000aTo truly appreciate how we got to this point in December 2015 in Paris, and in the run-up to the next round of major climate change negotiations scheduled to take place in Marrakech later this month, it may help to take a step back and understand the history of both climate change science and international cooperation around the issue. It is one thing, after all, to read about India\u2019s commitment to reduce emissions intensity by 33-35% by 2030\u2014which may not mean much to the average citizen\u2014and another altogether to know how all of this came to be.\u000a\u000aThe very first climate measurement efforts began in 1873. Under the International Meteorological Organization (IMO) that was chartered that year, a network of weather stations was established and standards for data collection from these stations were put in place. As the number of scientists working in this area began to grow\u2014though at a gruellingly slow pace over a period of four decades\u2014the military and colonial applications of this knowledge became apparent. Knowledge of weather patterns in adversarial terrains stood to give tremendous military advantage to whichever side had access to the data. Similarly, colonialists benefited from the knowledge of weather patterns that could help them develop efficient agricultural practices suited to specific regions. Money and resources were, therefore, continually invested in the study and development of this science.\u000a\u000aBy the time of World War II, the military potential of meteorology had been truly realized. The Allied powers led by the US and Britain were able to get decisive territorial advantage over their German adversaries in the Normandy Invasion of 1944 when Allied meteorologists found a break in stormy weather patterns that the Germans took for granted.\u000a\u000aThe military relevance of meteorology, therefore, led to the global prominence of the IMO. In 1950, the IMO became a part of the United Nations, changed its name to the World Meteorological Organization (which still operates under the UN umbrella today), and received bona fide financial and global political support. The flow of research dollars led to a number of scientific initiatives that furthered our understanding of the climate.\u000a\u000aThe first was the tracking of carbon dioxide levels in Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, that laid the basis of atmospheric carbon dioxide monitoring. The second was the setting up of research bases in Antarctica and Greenland which led to the drilling of ice cores that revealed to us long-term climate history. The third was the deployment of global satellite systems, which, while primarily had military applications in the Cold War era, helped us see and monitor the Earth as a whole for the first time. And the fourth was the use of supercomputers in mathematical modelling of the climate. The combination of these factors would provide the underlying basis for the thesis that our climate was rapidly changing due to human activity.\u000a\u000aIn parallel, concern over human-induced climate change was spilling over from scientific circles to the public at large. Among other factors, a killer smog in London in 1953, followed by a similar smog in Los Angeles and then in New York in 1966, made people aware that the chemicals spewed into the air from industry had fatal consequences. The risk of climatological and nuclear warfare during the Cold War\u2014i.e. the use of atomic bombs to disrupt weather patterns\u2014captured popular imagination as well.\u000a\u000aAfter the end of the Cold War in 1991, it seemed like the world could finally prioritize managing climate change, which by this time had been soundly assessed by the scientific community, as well as was a matter of serious public concern. In 1992, the Rio Earth Summit was convened in Brazil and resulted in a treaty that established the United Nations Framework for Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC has since been organizing the Conferences of Parties (COPs) to find a globally acceptable pathway to mitigate climate change. The Paris conference was the 21st such convention of the COP.\u000a\u000aTwo diplomatic peculiarities stand out about the COPs. The first is that all negotiating parties have an equal veto power; and the second is that any agreement must be subsequently ratified by national parliaments, or equivalent national authorities, to come into effect. So, not only can a tiny country that you likely haven\u2019t even heard of, say, Belize, derail everyone else\u2019s efforts at a COP; but even if everyone did agree on the negotiating table, the lack of a treaty\u2019s ratification at home\u2014as had happened in the case of the US\u2019s non-ratification of the Kyoto Protocol from the third COP\u2014could render all efforts useless as well.\u000a\u000aIt has taken 21 rounds of negotiations over a quarter of a century to arrive at a binding agreement. The fact that the Paris agreement was ratified at a record pace of less than 12 months shows the widespread consensus behind the need for climate change mitigation today. In light of the 140-plus year history of this effort, we have truly come a long way.\u000a\u000aSumant Sinha is chief executive of ReNew Power. Silent Spring will appear every fortnight and look at issues related to the environment, climate change and renewable energy.

VHYDERABAD: Climate change was the biggest challenge for all humanity and countries must address the problem before it was too late, said climate experts in a two-day conference in the city.\u201cNot many have understood the seriousness of climate change. We ( Norway ) are a witness to extreme weathers but during last the few years, the extreme weathers have become more extreme. Areas that were once considered to be safe zones are no longer the same,\u201c Norweigan ambassador to In dia, Nils Ragnar Kamsvag said during the international conference on climate change on Wednesday.The objective of the conference is to understand the bio-physical, technological, institutional, social, economic and political drivers for future agricultural development and food security. As part of the two-day conference, there would be deliberations on 15 themes and discussions on as many as 70 research papers.On the occasion, Kamsvag called upon various nations to come forward and join hands and address the challenges properly.He also said that he was hopeful of a positive outcome from the Conference of Parties (COP 22) and the forthcoming 12th session of COP 22. He also put the onus on the upcoming United States elections, saying it would be a decisive force in climate change.According to Uday Shekhar Nagothu , professor and director, Norweigan Institute of Bio-economy Research , the year 2016 had turned out to be the hottest year. \u201cThe weather pattern has always been in a flux, but the recent changes are a red-herring,\u201c he said.

(Reuters)\u000a\u000aAgainst the backdrop of the gains that last year\u2019s COP 21 Paris accord promises\u2014some of the top emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG) including the US committed to significant cuts in emissions\u2014Donald Trump being elected as the US president would seem like a case of \u201cone step forward, two steps back\u201d. Not only has Trump taken a climate-sceptic position in the past, vowing to dismantle the US\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in \u201calmost every form\u201d, he has also previously said that he would \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris agreement and roll-back the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the domestic regulations to cut emissions. Though he can\u2019t unilaterally stop the CPP that aims to cut US emissions by 32% from the 2005 levels by 2030, if he is able to get support from the Republican-dominated Congress and Senate, this could become a reality sooner than expected. The programme has already been challenged in the courts by 28 states and more than 100 companies, as per the New York Times, and could end up before the Supreme Court as early as next year. So, if the president-elect of the second-largest emitter in the world hits the brakes, the entire climate change mitigation vision collapses.\u000a\u000aThe strongest sign that the US is headed down that path is Trump picking Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2014who believes human-activity related warming is \u201cmodest\u201d and could actually be \u201cbeneficial\u201d\u2014to head the transition at the EPA. One estimate pegs US policies to account for about 20% of the expected emission reduction between 2016 and 2030 under the Paris plan. If the new president reverses the country\u2019s stand, the world is in for irreversible and damaging warming.

VThe ISA gives India an opportunity to take global leadership in the fight against climate change. (Source: For representational purpose/Reuters photo) The ISA gives India an opportunity to take global leadership in the fight against climate change. (Source: For representational purpose/Reuters photo)\u000a\u000aLess than a year after it proposed a unique coalition of sunlight-rich countries to fight climate change through deployment of renewable energy, India has been able to make the International Solar Alliance (ISA) a reality. On Tuesday, more than 20 countries signed a Framework Agreement on International Solar Alliance which will take the shape of a separate international treaty once it is operationalised.\u000a\u000aThe framework agreement is not only the most concrete deliverable coming out of the Marrakesh climate change conference, it could also prove to be the game-changer in the global fight against climate change depending on the number of countries that eventually join it. Strictly speaking, ISA agreement is separate from the UN-mandated climate change talks that are held every year. But it was proposed at the Paris climate conference last year and has become a reality at the Marrakesh meeting now, thus getting closely linked with the UN climate process.\u000a\u000aThe revolution in the deployment of solar energy in the last six-seven years has been made possible by a sharp drop in the costs of production of electricity through solar cells. The costs have come down by 80-85 per cent in the last seven years, thanks to a rapidly growing demand as countries look to move away from fossil fuels on climate change concerns. This has made solar energy very competitive in comparison to the more traditional sources of electricity generation like coal-fired thermal power plants. The total installed capacity of solar energy across the globe has risen by almost eight times during the same time.\u000a\u000aThe International Solar Alliance, proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Paris last year, is an attempt to accelerate this process further by boosting the global demand for solar energy. More than 120 countries are geographically located in the tropics, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, either fully or partially. These places get ample sunlight throughout the year, making solar energy an easily available resources.\u000a\u000aThese countries also happen to be ones where maximum growth in energy demand is expected in the coming years, considering that these are areas where current production is woefully short of requirement. The ISA is an effort to ensure that as these countries rapidly ramp up their electricity production, they should predominantly use solar energy and avoid fossil fuels. But this can happen only if the costs of solar energy are competitive to the traditional sources.\u000a\u000aThe ISA seeks to do three things to bring down the costs of technology as well as the costs of finance needed for a solar project. It seeks to boost global demands which will result in further reduction in prices of solar energy deployment. It also seeks to promote standardisation in the use of equipments and processes for generating electricity. Standardisation will make the manufacturing of equipments and other hardware cheaper.\u000a\u000aThe third thing it seeks to do is to boost research and development, particularly in areas of efficient storage systems. The number of countries that signed the ISA agreement on Tuesday was far less than India\u2019s expectations of at least 50, but that was partly due to the fact that the signing ceremony coincided with a lunch that Morocco\u2019s King had arranged for all visiting heads of states and ministers, and that venue of the ceremony was some distance away from the conference venue. The ISA has, in the last year, received solid support from a large number of countries, including many like France and the United States of America, which are not exactly tropical countries.\u000a\u000aThe US has repeatedly expressed its desire to join the alliance. France actually did on Tuesday. More countries are likely to sign up during the remaining days of the conference and also later. The signing has to be followed by ratifications by countries. The agreement will become operational after at least 15 countries have ratified it. The framework agreement says that the members of ISA would take coordinated actions through programmes and activities that will aggregate the demands for solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity building.\u000a\u000aThe ISA gives India an opportunity to take global leadership in the fight against climate change. The secretariat of the ISA is to be located in India. It will also host a meeting of ISA assembly every year. India has promised to contribute $27 million for creating building infrastructure and recurring expenditure for five years, till 2020-21. A part of this money will also go towards creating a corpus fund of $16 million that will generate revenues for the budget of ISA.

VClimate change leadership requires an approach where needs and interests of the poorest and most vulnerable are kept at the centre. Climate change leadership requires an approach where needs and interests of the poorest and most vulnerable are kept at the centre.\u000a\u000aWhile on the face of it, countries did celebrate the outcome of the latest round of climate negotiations in Marrakesh, the uncertainty brought out by the US presidential elections is likely to be on the mind of everyone returning from Marrakesh. If Donald Trump executes his threat of pulling his country out of the climate convention, the negotiations will lose out on US diplomatic efforts that have been pivotal to their success in the past few years \u2014 the rapid entry into force of the Paris Agreement that was adopted by all countries in 2015 being its last success.\u000a\u000aWith the US likely to be out of commission during Trump\u2019s presidential tenure, the world has started looking out for a leader to fill this void. The first answer that comes to mind is China. The country\u2019s engagement in climate change diplomacy has been growing rapidly. The two punch approach by the US and China have, of late, left other countries with no option but to follow their lead. The texts of the final agreements of the CoP 20 and CoP 21 summits were directly adopted from the joint statements made by the two countries in the run-up to the summits, particularly on the crucial issues of differentiation and the legal nature of commitments. With the US in the back row, the Chinese are poised to be in the driver\u2019s seat.\u000a\u000aBut this leadership void on climate change action needs to be filled carefully. The Chinese approach to foreign policy has been relatively inward-looking. This is evident in Chinese economic investments in other developing countries, particularly in the African continent, and in the country\u2019s latest diplomatic response to its claims on the South China Sea. China\u2019s responses to India\u2019s recent foreign policy aspirations such as membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the UN resolution to ban terrorist organisations were well-calculated to suit its own concerns and not global interests.\u000a\u000aClimate change leadership requires an approach where needs and interests of the poorest and most vulnerable are kept at the centre. Such kind of leadership has eluded us so far, with only a few countries deciding the global course of action. This is a great opportunity for India to orchestrate an \u201calliance of the willing\u201d that can be a positive counterbalance to the existing power structure. This role is not new for India, which played a crucial role in providing leadership during the Cold War with the establishment of the Non Alignment Movement.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s foreign policy approach, \u201cPanchsheel\u201d \u2014 the five principles of co-existence whose bedrock is mutual self-respect, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and cooperation for mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence \u2014 could be the basis of the new modus operandi for building this \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d for climate change action. For this, India will need to increase its ambition on climate change action. It has already committed to ambitious climate action at home; this can be augmented through stronger commitments, particularly in the transport sector. Sound long-term planning in infrastructure decisions and providing greater incentives in the financial markets for climate action will also provide India opportunities to show the rest of the world that stronger action on climate change can go hand-in-hand with actions needed to meet development imperatives.\u000a\u000aWhile taking greater action at home will enable India to position itself for a leadership role, India\u2019s foreign policy approach to climate change needs to be enhanced. Not only will India need to establish cooperation within the South Asian neighbourhood but it will also have to reach out to other developing country partners \u2014 like it has in forums such as the BRICS. India has a lot to share, particularly on matters of technology. But it has also much to learn about the implementation of climate action in a complicated policy and social environment.\u000a\u000aIndia could host multi-country forums on climate change on the same lines as the Major Economies Forum hosted by the US as well as Petersburg Dialogue, traditionally hosted by Germany.India could reach out to Fiji \u2014 the host of the next climate change convention \u2014 and offer technical and political help to make the next round of negotiations a success. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already established strong ties with Fiji by becoming the first Indian PM to visit the country in 33 years and providing it a $ 75 million credit.\u000a\u000aThough a leadership void resulting from the US election stares the world, India should view it as a potential opportunity to establish itself as a global leader.\u000a\u000a(This article first appeared in the print edition under the headline \u201cIndia\u2019s Trump card\u201d)\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VThere was no hobnobbing of political leaders of major powers, and no big decisions to generate global excitement. There was no hobnobbing of political leaders of major powers, and no big decisions to generate global excitement.\u000a\u000aCompared to the several breakthrough developments around climate change in the last one year, including the landmark Paris Agreement, outcomes of the Marrakesh climate conference that ended earlier this month seem underwhelming. There was no hobnobbing of political leaders of major powers, and no big decisions to generate global excitement.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, the outcomes from Marrakesh quicken the momentum to build a new global climate change architecture. Marrakesh did not have any major issue to resolve \u2014 its main agenda was to begin work on framing the rules and procedures that would guide the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Considering the Paris Agreement had entered into force much sooner than expected \u2014 in less than a year of being finalised \u2014 not much discussion on the rulebook had taken place prior to the conference. As such, nobody expected that the rules would be finalised in Marrakesh itself.\u000a\u000aWatch What Else Is Making News\u000a\u000aNegotiators began work on the rulebook in Marrakesh, and gave themselves up to 2018 to finish, thereby all but ensuring that the provisions of the Paris Agreement would start getting implemented soon afterward \u2014 again, much earlier than anticipated.\u000a\u000aBesides the negotiations on the procedural details of the rulebook, several important partnerships were stitched up on the sidelines of the conference. These partnerships, like the India-led International Solar Alliance, are essentially outside of the UN process under which Paris was negotiated, but represent the growing desire on the part of countries and non-government agencies such as businesses and city administrations to do their bit in the fight against climate change.\u000a\u000aSome of these partnerships could prove to be the gamechangers needed to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times.\u000a\u000aInternational Solar Alliance\u000a\u000aISA, an initiative launched by India in Paris, seeks to bring together all countries in the sun-rich tropics to boost the global demand of solar energy deployment, and ensure standardisation in the use of equipment and processes. It also aims to promote research and development in solar technologies, all of which are likely to bring down costs of both technology and finance, and lead to further increases in deployment.\u000a\u000aIndia went to Marrakesh with a draft Framework Agreement on International Solar Alliance, which 26 countries signed. The Agreement will take the shape of an international treaty once 15 countries that have signed up, ratify it. About 120 countries lie, either fully or in part, between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and are potential members of the treaty. Some 80 countries had supported the declaration of the alliance last year.\u000a\u000aAdaptation of African Agriculture (AAA)\u000a\u000aThe entire continent contributes just about 4% to global greenhouse gases, but is likely to be one of the worst affected by climate change. African countries are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, and the cycle of droughts and floods induced by climate change could devastate economies and lead to further poverty and hunger.\u000a\u000aThe triple-A initiative seeks to climate-proof agriculture in Africa by promoting sustainable soil management, better water management, and risk mitigation strategies. 27 African countries are already on the platform. International agencies like the Food and Agriculture Organisation are supporting the alliance, which will also act as a platform for seeking and channeling financial flows meant for climate change adaptation purposes.\u000a\u000aMission Innovation\u000a\u000aThis too was announced in Paris, the brainchild of the US. It aims to promote research and development in clean energy technologies. In Marrakesh, Finland and the Netherlands formally joined the mission, taking the number of countries on the platform to 23. These countries together have pledged an investment of $ 30 billion over the next 5 years in clean energy research. There will be greater research collaborations between these countries, which together account for almost 80% of all investments into clean energy research.\u000a\u000aThe mission has identified 7 innovation challenges, including smart grids, carbon capture and sequestration, building of storage cells for solar energy, clean energy materials and sustainable biofuels.\u000a\u000aClimate Vulnerable Forum\u000a\u000aThis is a group of countries that are most vulnerable to climate impacts. It has been in existence since 2009, when 11 countries voiced their common concerns. It has operated mostly on the sidelines. But in Marrakesh, the number of countries on the platform reached 48, and the group got a lot of attention.\u000a\u000aMember countries stressed that the target should be to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 (not 2) degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times. They vowed to update their climate action plans before 2020 to bring in greater ambition, and prepare a long-term low-carbon development strategy for 2050 with a 1.5-degree target in mind. They also said they would strive to reach 100% renewable energy production between 2030 and 2050.\u000a\u000a2050 Pathway Platform\u000a\u000aThis is an effort to get countries, cities and businesses to accept long-term targets for climate action. Countries have submitted 5-year or 10-year action plans as part of their commitments under the Paris deal. Fixing long-term targets, for say 2050, forecloses the possibility of countries doing too little in the beginning and then failing to scale up their ambition to required levels in later years.\u000a\u000aAt least 20 countries, 17 states, 15 cities and 196 businesses joined the platform in Marrakesh. Each promised to come up with climate objectives for 2050 and strive to work towards achieving those targets. The US, Germany, Canada and Mexico unveiled decarbonisation plans for 2050. The US said it would cut emissions by 80% of 2005 levels by 2050; Germany said it would reduce emissions by up to 95% on 1990 levels.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App

VWASHINGTON: Donald Trump plans to dismantle President Barack Obama's efforts to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions. But delivering on his campaign pledges to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and bring back tens of thousands of long-gone coal mining jobs could prove far more difficult.\u000a\u000aInternal documents from the president-elect's transition team reviewed by The Associated Press show the new administration plans to stop defending the Clean Power Plan and other recent Obama-era environmental regulations that have been the subject of long-running legal challenges filed by Republican-led states and the fossil fuel industry.\u000a\u000aAgainst that potential opposition, environmental groups are gearing up to defend Obama's environmental legacy in court.\u000a\u000a"We anticipate challenging every single attempt to roll back regulations on air, water and climate," said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, who added that his group is already hiring additional lawyers. Fundraising for environmental causes also has spiked since Trump's victory.\u000a\u000aThough Republicans have for years blamed environmental regulations for the decline of coal, data from the U.S. Department of Energy shows the primary cause is the emergence of cheaper, more abundant natural gas from hydraulic fracturing. Another factor is the plummeting cost of solar panels and wind turbines, which now can produce emissions-free electricity cheaper than burning coal.\u000a\u000aLeading Trump's transition team on the EPA is Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank that gets financial support from the fossil fuel industry and that opposes "global-warming alarmism."\u000a\u000aThough his academic credentials are in philosophy and political theory, Ebell is an enthusiastic denier of the voluminous scientific data that show the planet is warming and that burning fossil fuels is primarily to blame.\u000a\u000aTrump said during the campaign he would "cancel" the Paris agreement to make global reductions in carbon emissions that Obama signed in December.\u000a\u000aThe agreement was not a treaty and was not approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, and legal experts agree that as president Trump would have the authority to walk away. Even without a formal withdrawal, Trump could simply order EPA not to take any action toward meeting the U.S. commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels within the next 10 years.\u000a\u000aTrump appeared to soften his position in a recent interview with The New York Times, saying he now has an "open mind" about the Paris agreement. He also shifted away from his year-long insistence that climate change is a "hoax," conceding there may be "some connectivity" between human activity and the warming of the planet.\u000a\u000aStill, Trump's advisers have suggested he will eliminate NASA's world-class climate research program, which tracks the warming of the planet, melting Arctic sea ice and rising oceans using an array of purpose-built satellites orbiting the globe.\u000a\u000aHowever, NASA's study of earth science is currently mandated by federal law, which means voiding the program would require congressional action. Even assuming unanimous Republican support, Senate Democrats could block such an effort through a filibuster.\u000a\u000aAs a legal matter, Trump also can't simply get rid of the EPA. Though established in 1970 by President Richard Nixon through an executive order, eliminating a federal Cabinet agency would require congressional approval and face a likely filibuster.\u000a\u000aEven without a wholesale elimination, Trump and the GOP-led Congress could gut the agency's budget - defunding core enforcement efforts enshrined under the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. During the campaign, Trump proposed slashing the EPA's $8 billion budget as a way to offset some of the cost of his planned tax cuts.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists and former EPA officials say decades of gains made under both Democratic and Republican administrations would potentially be lost if Trump weakens the agency. Christie Todd Whitman, a Republican who served as EPA administrator under President George W. Bush, worries EPA is likely to suffer a brain drain as key regulatory staff retire or resign rather than serve under Trump.\u000a\u000a"It would behoove Republicans to remember EPA was signed into law by a Republican president working with a Democratic Congress because the public wanted to protect the environment," Whitman said. "They wanted clean air to breathe, they were tired of seeing rivers spontaneously combust and the land turned into a garbage dump."\u000a\u000aInternal transition documents show Trump's primary targets are Clean Power Plan limits on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants and a recent EPA rule expanding the definition of "waters of the United States" protected under the Clean Water Act to include smaller creeks and wetlands. Other items include EPA's recently issued standards for reducing smog caused by coal-fired power plants and limits on harmful emissions and chemical-laden waste water from oil and gas operations.\u000a\u000aDismantling EPA regulations is difficult, especially if the rules have already been finalized and implemented.\u000a\u000a"The agency has already built up a very strong record to support those rules," said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School. "It can be very hard to do an about-face."

Yet we are ranked amongst the top 10 countries that are most vulnerable to climate change."\u000a\u000aThe world community was also informed that faced several major risks pertaining to climate change, including glacier melting, variable monsoons, recurrent floods, rise in sea levels, higher average temperatures and higher frequency of droughts.\u000a\u000aMillions of people had been affected and a colossal damage was caused on a recurring basis, he said.\u000a\u000a"These threats pose major survival concerns for Pakistan, particularly in relation to water security, food security and energy security," Hamid said, adding these threats also had enormous adverse consequences for all socio-economic sectors, limiting the country's ability to promote sustainable growth and development.\u000a\u000aThe minister emphasised that as a responsible member of the global community had taken substantial steps, especially during 2016, to tackle the threat of climate change.\u000a\u000aHe termed the launch of Rs2-billion Prime Minister's Green Pakistan Programme, which would be implemented across the country, as a historic initiative.\u000a\u000aPakistan has developed the National Sustainable Development Strategy and is perhaps the first country in the world whose National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution adopting the SDGs as its own national development agenda, said the minister.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VThe sun is setting on Japan\u2019s clean-energy boom, despite projects like a massive floating solar farm near Tokyo, as the government cuts subsidies and bets on nuclear and coal-fired power, critics say.\u000a\u000aWorkers at the floating power station, one of the world\u2019s biggest, have just finished laying about 50,000 interconnected panels on a vast dam reservoir.\u000a\u000aTaking up space equivalent to several Tokyo Dome-sized baseball stadiums, the vast carpet of panels will supply power to about 5,000 homes from early 2018.\u000a\u000aThe project is the centrepiece of a solar-dominated wave of renewable energy investments that followed the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.\u000a\u000aThe accident forced the shutdown of reactors that had supplied about one-quarter of resource-poor Japan\u2019s energy.\u000a\u000aHighlights Japan has invested heavily in solar energy following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster but the trend of clean-energy boom is likely to fall in the near future.\u000a\u000aThe country is facing a shortage of land for new solar installations.\u000a\u000aThe government is also cutting back on subsidies while commodities including coal, oil and natural gas is set to remain cheap.\u000a\u000aJapan is investing heavily in coal-fired energy on its own soil, with more than 40 new power plants in the pipeline.\u000a\u000aThe island nation was among the worst performers in terms of countries cutting back on energy-related CO2 emissions in an annual ranking released during UN climate talks in 2016.\u000a\u000aTo plug the gap, electricity providers have been obliged since 2012 to buy power generated from green suppliers, including solar, at above-market rates -- known as feed-in tariffs -- fixed by the government each year.\u000a\u000aBut renewable energy investments have plateaued and are set to fall in the coming years as Tokyo cuts back subsidies while commodities including coal, oil and natural gas remain cheap.\u000a\u000aJapan is also facing a shortage of land for new solar installations.\u000a\u000aKyocera, which is behind the floating farm south of Tokyo, is building a solar plant on an abandoned golf course.\u000a\u000a\u201cSeveral dynamics in the Japanese power sector have shifted since (2012) -- such as weakening government support, cheaper fuel alternatives and electricity sector reform -- which have all contributed to the slowdown in growth,\u201d BMI Research said in a report.\u000a\u000aA Japanese worker checking solar panels at a floating solar farm of KYOCERA company on the Yamakura dam reservoir near Ichihara city in Japan.

VIndia is the world\u2019s most attractive destination in the energy sector that has the potential to attract a trillion dollars in investment over the next few years, Union power minister Piyush Goyal said on Saturday.\u000a\u000aThe minister of state with independent charge for power, coal and renewable energy said that his optimism for the energy sector stemmed from the Narendra Modi government\u2019s climate commitment.\u000a\u000aIndia has signed the Paris climate accord and is committed to significantly reducing its carbon footprint. And taking a lead on this mission is Goyal\u2019s ministry of renewable energy. The government has set an ambitious target of setting up 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022.\u000a\u000a\u201cSolar is a major focus. From 2500 MW in 2014, installed renewable energy is now 8500 MW. We have done three times in two years of what was done in the past many decades,\u201d said the power minister on the second day of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.\u000a\u000aBut Goyal\u2019s ministry is working on adding equal weightage to other forms of green power such as wind and hydropower, by easing policies.\u000a\u000aThe government is in the process of giving final touches to a hydropower policy that will address several issues that have plagued these projects, especially land acquisition.\u000a\u000aHe was quick to clarify that India was not responsible for the worsening global warming concerns -- even with 17% population it contributes to 2-2.5% of green house gases \u2013 but the government was committed to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is an article of faith with the Modi government that we expand renewable energy and reduce pollution as we generate power,\u201d Goyal said.\u000a\u000aThe minister said the developed world had emitted a bulk of the greenhouse gases and based on the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle, the West had a responsibility to help India.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe hope the West will come up to their promises. So far their efforts have been terrible.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf India\u2019s total installed power capacity of over 300 GW, about 46 GW is renewable including solar, wind and small hydropower projects.\u000a\u000aWhile Piyush Goyal is working overtime to increase the percentage of renewable sources in India\u2019s energy mix, the minister feels that his initiatives will not disincentivise coal-based power projects.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need coal-based thermal power to provide stable base load in the grid to support renewable sources of power,\u201d said Goyal. Simply put, to avoid instability in power transmission, coal-based power is required to flow through grids, as renewable energy supply depends on weather conditions.

VNew Delhi: Environmental crisis could become the dominant crisis of the coming years, said leading experts at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2016 on Saturday while batting for planning for next 20-25 years to deal with water crisis which is already a very serious global concern.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia has got a lot of troubles. You can\u2019t breathe the air, you can\u2019t find water. Indians need to think on this. India dismantled the planning commission, but we need desperate planning to cope up with water crisis and climate change. Water treatment solution needs significant amount of investment but budgets are tight, which is why, we need planning,\u201d said Jeffrey Sachs, university professor, Columbia University, while speaking at the summit on The Global Water Crisis. What next?.\u000a\u000aSachs expressed concern at India\u2019s intention to double coal production in next few years. He also said that he agrees with India\u2019s minister for new and renewable energy Piyush Goyal who has said that the West needs to pay for their past emissions but cautioned that India needs to ensure that lack of action from West doesn\u2019t become excuse for India to do nothing. He also stressed on need of pricing water.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone should have certain amount of water for free, above that amount one needs to pay. By this way, no one will be denied their human right to get adequate water and also, water will be treated as an economic resource,\u201d said Sachs while adding that if you are planning for water, have to plan for it 20-25 years in the future which means looking ahead in a serious way.\u000a\u000aDavid Sedlak, Plato Malozemoff professor, University of California, Berkeley, also stressed on global water crisis and said \u201cwe need to find urban water solutions that are decentralized from bureaucracy\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cWorld has gone through three water revolutions and these have happened because of the crisis. Technology has enabled to miniaturize water treatment plants. We need to create networks of self-managed water treatment plants which will help save costs in the long-term. An environmental crisis doesn\u2019t become a crisis unless there is a social movement,\u201d said Sedlak. He also said that, \u201cwhenever we think of water, we think agriculture, but the cities and towns shouldn\u2019t be left out\u201d.\u000a\u000aBoth Sedlak and Sachs also exhorted the global leaders to take decisive action. \u201cOur political leaders are a bunch of irresponsible people with an aim to stay in office, not to make our children safe. We are halfway to what is acknowledged as a dire environmental threat to humanity. Yet we don\u2019t have an action plan. We need global climate action that\u2019s decisive and not just rhetorical,\u201d Sachs added.\u000a\u000aOn India\u2019s ambitious plan of interlinking rivers across the length and breadth of the country, Sedlak said, \u201cthese projects inevitably don\u2019t succeed\u201d.

VSome 116 scientists from 18 countries contributed to the analysis. (File Photo) Some 116 scientists from 18 countries contributed to the analysis. (File Photo)\u000a\u000aLast year\u2019s heat waves across Europe and Asia, fires in Alaska, unusually sunny winters in Britain and high-tide floods in Florida were influenced by climate change, a US report showed today. But other extreme weather events could not be blamed on the burning of fossil fuels which traps gas in the atmosphere and warms the planet, said the report called \u201cExplaining Extreme Events from a Climate Perspective.\u201d\u000a\u000aWatch What Else Is Making News\u000a\u000aThose for which scientists found \u201cno climate signal\u201d included the extreme cold in the eastern US and Canada, the late arrival of Nigeria\u2019s spring rains and heavy daily precipitation in December over Chennai, India.\u000a\u000aThe report, regularly published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, does not cover all extreme weather events, but allows scientists to select and study certain ones of interest.\u000a\u000aScientists then use historical records and climate models to attempt to explain the extent of the impact of climate change in shaping them.\u000a\u000aThe latest report is based on 25 peer-reviewed research papers that examine episodes of extreme weather of 2015 over five continents and two oceans.\u000a\u000aSome 116 scientists from 18 countries contributed to the analysis.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe strongest evidence for a human influence was found for temperature-related events \u2014 the increased intensity of numerous heat waves, diminished snowpack in the Cascades, record-low Arctic sea ice extent in March and the extraordinary extent and duration of Alaska wildfires,\u201d said the report.\u000a\u000aMonthly temperature records show that 2016 is likely to be the hottest on record, marking the third such year in a row as the planet warms.\u000a\u000aScientists say some storms and other kinds of extreme weather are likely to get worse as the Earth heats up, glaciers and ice sheets melt and sea levels rise.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter five years of the BAMS Explaining Extreme Events report, we\u2019re seeing mounting evidence that climate change is making heat waves more extreme in many regions around the world,\u201d said lead editor Stephanie Herring, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Environmental Information.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs we get better at distinguishing the influence of climate change from natural variability, the local significance and impacts of this global phenomenon are becoming clearer.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VNew Delhi: The share of non-fossil fuels in India\u2019s sources of electricity will increase way beyond the nation\u2019s climate change commitments and much earlier than initially thought, according to a five year energy blueprint brought out by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), a federal statutory body.\u000a\u000aCEA said in the draft national electricity plan, 2016, that the share of non-fossil fuel power generation capacity comprising hydel, nuclear and renewable sources of energy, will reach 46.8% by 2021-22, up from 30% at the beginning of this year.\u000a\u000aThis is well ahead of what was prescribed as India\u2019s intended nationally determined contribution, a commitment made at the UN framework convention on climate change in Paris last December of relying on non-fossil fuels for 40% of electricity generation by 2030.\u000a\u000aNon-fossil fuels are expected meet 56.5 % of India\u2019s electricity requirement by the end of 2026-27, according to the plan.\u000a\u000aThe projection comes at a time of rapid expansion in renewable energy capacity and regular upgradation of nuclear power capacity. India has about 50 giga watt (GW) of renewable energy capacity including small hydel projects. Of this, about 28 GW is wind power and 8.5 GW is solar.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, the country has about a 5.7 GW of nuclear power generation capacity and the Department of Atomic Energy has set a target of having 63 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2032.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe country is moving in the direction of relying more on clean energy and less on fossil fuels, enabled by technological advances, viability of projects and the right pricing,\u201d said Vikram Kailas, MD and CEO, Mytrah Energy Ltd. a renewable energy company. Kailas said the country\u2019s solar power capacity is set to reach 20 GW within the next couple of years.\u000a\u000aThe draft electricity plan also estimated that about 268 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission will be avoided annually by the end of the year 2021-22 from renewable energy sources.

(Source: Reuters)\u000a\u000aOfficials in 24 states have urged US President-elect Donald Trump to kill the centerpiece of President Barack Obama\u2019s strategy to combat climate change and shut down coal-fired power plants.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe coalition requested the incoming Republican government undo the Clean Power Plan enacted by the current Democratic administration. The law was designed to lower carbon emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. The Supreme Court has ordered a delay in implementation until legal challenges to the regulation are completed.\u000a\u000aThe group, headed by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, suggests Congress take action to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from drafting similar regulations in the future.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe order (to withdraw the plan) should explain that it is the administration\u2019s view that the (Clean Power Plan) is unlawful and that EPA lacks authority to enforce it. The executive order is necessary to send an immediate and strong message to States and regulated entities that the administration will not enforce the rule,\u201d according to Morrisey.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s potential Cabinet is filling with nominees from top fossil fuel-producing states. He tapped Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an ardent opponent of Obama\u2019s measures to curb climate change, to run the Environmental Protection Agency and Rick Perry, a climate skeptic and former governor of Texas, to head the Department of Energy.\u000a\u000aTrump has promised to revive oil and gas drilling and coal mining by cutting back on federal regulations. He also has said he would pull the United States out of a global deal to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which an overwhelming number of scientists say contribute to changes to the climate that are leading to sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VWASHINGTON - Officials in two dozen states are asking President-elect Donald Trump to issue an executive order on his first day in office declaring as illegal President Barack Obama's plan to curb planet-warming carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aThe letter sent to Trump and congressional leaders on Thursday is signed by Republican officials from 22 states and Democrats from the coal-producing states of Kentucky and Missouri.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Supreme Court barred the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing the Clean Power Plan as lawsuits filed by more than two dozen states and fossil-fuel companies are weighed by an appeals court in Washington. The plan would require the eventual phase-out of many of the nation's coal-fired power plants.\u000a\u000aA ruling in the case is expected soon.

VHOMEWORK IS no longer a paper-pencil affair with many city schools going paperless in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. Notebooks and pencils have been replaced by cloud storage and web portals. For almost four years now, students of RN Podar School, Santacruz, have been doing their homeworks and assignments on google drive. \u201cWe rarely use paper any more for homework assigned to students. This includes both the senior and junior sections,\u201d said Nikita Bajaj, headmistress of the school.\u000a\u000aWatch What Else Is Making News:\u000a\u000aNot only assignments, all documentation is online today. Parents do not receive notices in hard copies anymore. \u201cTechnology has been put to good use. We have made a conscious change in our processes to reduce wastage of paper,\u201d said Bajaj, adding that making the switch has been a difficult task.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen assignments and homeworks are made online, they are prone to plagiarism. Teachers have to be on guard and design the assignments such that the students don\u2019t share their work or copy from the internet. Teachers\u2019 task has increased,\u201d said Bajaj.\u000a\u000aHowever, Bajaj said the school\u2019s practice to reduce wastage imbibes similar values in students at an early age. Along similar lines, Ryan International Group of Institutions has developed a dedicated portal for students. A username and password is issued to students as well as parents, who can log on to the portal to access any study material or communication.\u000a\u000aKalpana Dwivedi, principal of St Joseph\u2019s Panvel that has been using the portal for around three years, said: \u201cWe rarely use paper anymore as everything is online.

VKOCHI: Experts have recommended setting up of a common gene bank for vulnerable fish species besides setting up fish sanctuaries for improvement of natural stocks in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change on fish stock and marine ecosystem.The recommendations were made after the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) submitted the Country Status Report (CSR) about the impact of climate change on coastal fisheries and aquaculture sector.The ICAR institute, the leading fish research body in the country, presented the report at a meeting between the SAARC Agriculture Centre (SAC) and representatives from the SAARC nations held through video conference.The report exposed disruptions caused by climate change in areas such as marine ecosystem, fish stock, harvesting sector, aquaculture, market and trade. The present condition of fishing communities was also included in the report.During the conference, members representing fisheries and aquaculture sector of SAARC member countries reviewed remedial steps to be taken to mitigate the impact of climate change and finalised a set of recommendations to be followed by member countries.In the recommendations, the meeting prioritised developing collaborative and comprehensive efforts to address climate vulnerabilities. Conduct of awareness programmes on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expansion of open sea cage farming and pen culture in coastal water bodies were also listed among the recommendations. Among the other noteworthy recommendations finalised during the meeting include introduction of saline temperature tolerant and fast-growing fish species for coastal aquaculture, establishment of fish sanctuary for improvement of natural stocks and setting up common gene bank for vulnerable species.

VUS President-elect Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) US President-elect Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\u000a\u000a2016 was a happy year for environmentalists \u2014 until November, when Donald J Trump, self-confessed climate change denier, won the White House and busted the party. The Paris Agreement of December 2015 gave unprecedented momentum to the fight against climate change. In barely 10 months, the Agreement got the minimum number of ratifications required for it to come into force \u2014 the fastest operationalisation of any international agreement of its size and scope.\u000a\u000aIn between, countries approved a landmark amendment to the Montreal Protocol, enabling this 1997 ozone-saving arrangement to oversee a phasedown of the extremely dangerous hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases that are known to be hundreds to thousands of times more harmful than carbon dioxide in warming the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u000a\u000aWatch what else is making news:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe decision, which aims at eliminating about 90% of all HFC use by 2050, could be the single most important action against climate change, with a potential to shave off 0.5 degrees of global temperature rise by 2100.\u000a\u000aThen, in early October, a large number of countries agreed to voluntarily curb, from 2020, the rise of emissions from international aviation. Aircraft emissions, contributing roughly 2% of global emissions, are not covered by the Paris Agreement, and required a separate arrangement under the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\u000a\u000aRiding on all these successes, the world seemed to be getting itself seriously equipped to fight climate change. Until Trump surprised everyone by getting elected as the next President of the United States.\u000a\u000aThe election results came in the middle of the annual climate change conference in Marrakesh, Morocco. Many at the conference were in tears. Trump had called climate change a \u201cChinese hoax\u201d during the campaign, and had promised to tear up the Paris Agreement. He could undo all the hard work that had gone into stitching together a global climate agreement that seeks to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 2 degrees from pre-industrial times, which science says is essential to prevent catastrophic and irreversible impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aIt was feared that among Trump\u2019s first announcements after winning the Presidency would be the one about Paris. That, thankfully, did not happen. Trump even surprised many by saying, during an interaction with journalists of The New York Times, that there could be \u201csome connectivity\u201d between climate change and human activities. But hopes that he might be considering rethinking his climate change beliefs were dashed as he appointed ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson \u2014 who once described climate change as an \u201cengineering problem\u201d with \u201cengineering solutions\u201d \u2014 as Secretary of State, and Scott Pruitt as head of the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the very agency Pruitt had sued, and against whose \u201cactivist agenda\u201d he claims to be a \u201cleading advocate\u201d.\u000a\u000aIt is possible that Trump may eventually not take the US out of the Paris Agreement. But that in itself may not mean much. Considering the extraordinary international effort that is required to make available adequate finance and technology, the two most crucial resources in the fight against climate change, the world probably needed an activist US President to galvanise global action. Trump seems to be on the opposite end of the spectrum. Even without walking out, the US can cause terminal damage to the process by just being unenthusiastic, or by not doing enough. The weight of inaction can become a huge drag on the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and render it utterly meaningless.\u000a\u000aWhat gives many people hope, however, are Trump\u2019s business instincts. The fight against climate change offers a one-of-its-kind business opportunity worldwide. Investments worth hundreds of billions, probably trillions, of dollars are required in renewable energy, new and cleaner technologies, transport, and urban rejuvenation. Some of these, like renewable energy, are already among the fastest growing areas of investment. A large number of American companies are in line to exploit these opportunities \u2014 many have made huge investments across the world for the next 30-40 years. A global slowdown in these sectors triggered by US inaction could put these investments at risk.\u000a\u000aTrump is nothing if not an astute businessman. He has more friends in business than in politics. Therein lies hope for the fight against climate change in 2017.\u000a\u000aamitabh.sinha@expressindia.com\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App

VThe rapid growth in wing length of a common Western Australian bird may be related to climate change, according to a study released on Monday.\u000a\u000aScientists from the University of Notre Dame in Sydney linked the growth in wing length of the Australian ringneck parrot, or Barnardius zonarius, to climate change as the limbs of animals in warm climates tend to be longer, Efe news reported.\u000a\u000aThe wings of the parrot lengthened 4 to 5 cm in the last 45 years.\u000a\u000aAs temperatures rise, the increase in the length of wings can help these birds release excess heat and adapt better to their environment, said one of the study's scientists, Dylan Korczynskyj.\u000a\u000aKorczynskyj explained that the biggest changes in wing length have occurred since the 1970s, a period that coincides with temperature changes of more than 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius and deforestation carried out in the state of Western\u000a\u000aAlthough temperature variation appears minimal, the impact on the environment is significant, as evidenced by research on the bird species, he added.\u000a\u000aThe study examined several specimens from the museum of Western Australia, which has a collection of birds dating back to the early 19th century and includes a ringneck parrot specimen from 1904.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000aksk/vm\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VMelbourne: Climate change may cause the wing length of some birds to rapidly grow, according to scientists who warn that even small rise in temperatures may have a profound effect on various species.\u000a\u000aResearchers found that the wings of ringneck parrots\u2014commonly called twenty-eights \u2014has increased by four to five millimetres over the past 45 years. \u201cAs the climate might be increasing in temperature, the increase in wing length might actually help these birds shed that excess heat and so it is better matched with their environment,\u201d said professor Dylan Korczynskyj from the University of Notre Dame in the US.\u000a\u000aThe study examined birds specimens dating back to the early 18 century. The oldest ringneck parrot specimen used in the study dated back to 1904. The biggest changes in wing length have taken place since the 1970s, and that time frame correlated with increased temperatures and land clearing, Korczynskyj was quoted as saying by ABC News.\u000a\u000aEven small temperature changes could have a big impact on animals, researchers said. \u201cIn the 1970s in Western Australia for example, we might have only seen an increase in temperature of maybe 0.1 to 0.2 degrees every 10 years,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt sounds like a small amount, but in the scheme of the impact on the environment, obviously the research like ours is showing that it can actually have a profound effect on, in this case, the ringneck parrots,\u201d he added.

VHow will climate change impact livestock production? This question is significant for several reasons. For one, livestock contributes over 25 per cent of the agriculture sector\u2019s gross domestic product (agri-GDP). Besides, the prices of livestock products like milk, eggs, meat and fish are among the major drivers of food inflation.\u000a\u000aMoreover, this is a fast growing sector with a steady annual growth of nearly 5.6 per cent. The output of milk has risen annually by 4.2 per cent, eggs five per cent, fish (mainly farm-grown fish) eight per cent and meat 8.3 per cent. This apart, ...

VMore than 100 of Britain's top climate scientists today urged Prime Minister to press US President-elect Donald Trump to safeguard government-led research on global warming.\u000a\u000a"We stand ready to support and assist our counterparts in the United States... In resisting any political attempts to prevent, hamper or interfere with vital research on climate change," they wrote in an open letter to May, sent to AFP.\u000a\u000aA senior advisor to Trump has called for an end to climate research programmes at NASA, which provides vital data to scientists in the US and around the world.\u000a\u000aTrump himself has called climate change a "hoax". Several of his cabinet nominees have expressed similar views or opposed environmental protection policies in previous postings.\u000a\u000aMay should press Trump to "acknowledge the scientific evidence about the risks of climate change" and support the Paris Agreement, the scientists said.\u000a\u000aThe 196-nation Paris climate treaty vows to hold global warming to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and to provide money for poor countries coping with its impacts.\u000a\u000aThe letter added that must be "prepared to respond decisively" should Trump's administration take action to undermine climate research.\u000a\u000aIn interviews with two European newspapers published today, Trump confirmed his intention to meet with May soon after his inauguration as president on Friday.\u000a\u000ahas several of the world's leading institutions for the study of global warming and its impacts, including the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford.\u000a\u000aFormer British prime minister Margaret Thatcher was the first world leader to publically recognise the risks of climate change in 1988, the scientists noted.

VThe term climate change often brings to mind natural disasters such as heat wave, floods and cyclones. While such events may or may not be attributed to climate change, the real effects of this crisis are seemingly invisible and yet far more consequential.\u000a\u000aRising sea levels, changing weather patterns and decreasing water resources may not have just a one-time colossal impact, but a more pronounced effect in altering urban and rural economic landscapes for good.\u000a\u000aAccording to the World Bank, rising temperatures will impact multiple sectors of the economy, especially food, energy and water.\u000a\u000aIn India, extreme heat and changing rainfall pattern is expected to have a detrimental impact on the agricultural sector. Sea level rise may impact coastal ecosystems and degrade the quality of groundwater.\u000a\u000aIt is estimated that even on limiting the temperature rise to 2C, India might still need to import double the food grains as compared to a no-climate change scenario.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Stern Review, acting to reduce global emissions would cost the world 1-2 per cent of the global GDP a year, compared to the 5-20 per cent of the global GDP that it would cost by the end of the century, if the problem was ignored.\u000a\u000aImpacts linked to climate change have strong material and economic pertinence for India, estimated to cut billions of dollars from its total GDP by 2050. Limiting greenhouse gas emissions and moving to a low-carbon economy is the only way to tackle the impact.\u000a\u000aYet, in this adversity lies a seed of greater opportunity. The challenges posed by climate change offer a new vista of opportunities for existing and new businesses going forward. Climate action is the need of the hour and must be tackled with a strategy of financing a low-carbon economy.\u000a\u000aFinancing India\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will require innovative mechanisms to mobilise more than $2.5 trillion required to meet those targets. Green Bonds have been a successful tool in the realm of climate finance.\u000a\u000aSince YES Bank\u2019s issuance of India\u2019s first green infrastructure bonds in February 2015, approximately $2.7 billion worth of green bonds have been issued in India.\u000a\u000aSimilar financial instruments will need to be conceptualised for water, agriculture and related infrastructure to provide depth to climate bond markets. But such instruments need to be bolstered by adequate systems, such as credit guarantees, for them to reach scale.\u000a\u000aBlended finance is another structure that could be tailored for climate change projects. Resources need to be blended to create the requisite impact and scale needed for combating climate change, where development agencies provide the seed capital that businesses could leverage to generate effective returns on mainstream private capital deployed. The low-carbon pathway envisaged by India for its climate commitments, made at Paris, have led to new avenues for public and private action.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s steep target of achieving a renewable energy installed capacity of 175 GW by 2022 has been supported by developers and financiers, resulting in twice the cumulative solar installations in less than two years, reaching a capacity of 8.7 GW.\u000a\u000aEnergy efficiency is considered the cheapest source of energy and supportive policies like Partial Risk Guarantee Fund for Energy Efficiency and Partial Risk Sharing Facility will help boost support for deeper penetration of the concept in the industry through the Energy Services Companies model.\u000a\u000aIndia has also committed to creating a carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes that is supported by the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways through its National Green Highways Mission, which encourages corporates to \u2018Adopt a Green Highway\u2019. YES Bank recently became the first private institution to commit CSR funds towards creation of carbon sink through this program. The private sector remains a critical participant in taking the low carbon agenda forward.\u000a\u000aDevelopmental challenges such as long-term food and water security, are other significant areas of opportunity.\u000a\u000aWorking towards water use efficiency in agriculture, which accounts for more than 80 per cent of total fresh water withdrawals, calls for new technologies across irrigation techniques, seed varieties and agriculture practices.\u000a\u000aTraditional irrigation methods and instruments, like bawdis and tankas, which are ideal to conserve water, have to be married into the modern irrigation techniques like drip and sprinklers that use less water for irrigation.\u000a\u000aClimate change risks and impacts are slowly, yet steadily, trickling into every sector of the economy and exacerbating developmental challenges. However, this present-day challenge has also opened flood-gates of opportunities for the public and private sector. Bolstered by the framework of Sustainable Development Goals and the ratification of the Paris agreement, it is time for stakeholders including policy makers, industry, academia and the civil society to not only take incisive action towards combating climate change but also harnessing the opportunities it provides.\u000a\u000aThe author is Group President and MD (Climate Strategy and Responsible Banking), YES Bank

VKOLKATA: The telecom regulator has floated a consultation paper seeking industry feedback on ways to compute carbon footprint in telecom networks, and the need to involve third-party auditors for running checks on such emissions in step with the government\u2019s plans to ring in green phone networks.Carbon footprint is the extent of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. In a paper issued on Monday, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) has estimated that carbon emission level from mobile operators has jumped by over 70% over the past two-three years, and in 2014-15 it was pegged at 58.3 million tonnes.\u201cThese numbers indicate it is imperative to adopt new technologies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions in the mobile industry,\u201d Trai said in its paper that builds a case for energy efficiency in telecom sector. Merely \u201c90,000 of the total 4.5 lakh telecom towers in the country were diesel-free sites\u201d as on December 2016, it said.According to the regulator, "going green is also a business necessity for telcos" since energy costs account for a whopping 25% of total network operations costs. The government\u2019s green telecom policy unveiled nearly five years ago entails mobile carriers to migrate 50% and 20% of their cell towers in rural and urban areas, respectively, to hybrid power by December 2015, and as much as 75% and 33% by December 2020.Hybrid power is a mix of grid supplies and renewable energy based on solar, wind, biomass or fuel cells. In so far as carbon emissions go, telcos had been mandated by the telecom department to target 12% and 17% reductions by FY17 and FY19, respectively. In its consultation paper, the Trai has also invited suggestions on suitable formulae to compute carbon footprint stemming from grid power supply and diesel gensets.

VKolkata: With six years left for India to achieve its goal of generating 100 GW of electricity from solar projects, 25 states have fallen short of adding capacity by some 2,000 MW so far in 2016-17.\u000a\u000aThe biggest laggards are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, J&K and West Bengal, each of them missing the mark by more than 100 MW. In terms of renewable power purchase obligations during 2015-16, only Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Meghalaya, Karnataka, Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh exceeded their targets, according to the government.\u000a\u000aTamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Punjab managed to meet about 60% of their obligation. The remainder achieved up to 59% of their targets, with Manipur and Goa not meeting any.\u000a\u000a"Considering the actual renewable purchase obligation level specified by the state electricity regulatory commissions for the year 2016-17, it is estimated that 25 states/UTs require over 2,030 MW solar power capacity to fulfil the solar purchase obligation," the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy said in a recent document.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, it is estimated that 22 states and UTs require over 9,080 MW of non-solar power capacity to fulfil their obligations to purchase energy from other renewable sources.\u000a\u000aPromotion of renewable generation sources has now been added as an objective of the new tariff policy. The policy has provisions such as 8% solar purchase obligations by 2022 and renewable energy generation obligation on new coal/lignite-based thermal plants. Fully depreciated power plants whose purchase obligations have expired can now bundle their output with renewable energy. Renewable energy has also been exempted from inter-state transmission charges.

VNew Delhi: The government is exploring a change in the tariff structure for electricity from clean energy sources to boost India\u2019s efforts to promote a green economy.\u000a\u000aThe ministry of new and renewable energy is contemplating a fixed-cost component to the tariff for electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as solar or wind.\u000a\u000aThe idea is to prevent distribution companies (discoms) shying away from procuring electricity generated by such projects, as they will have to pay the fixed tariff component even if they don\u2019t buy the electricity contracted for.\u000a\u000aSuch a tariff mechanism already exists for electricity from conventional sources such as coal and gas which has two parts\u2014a fixed cost, which is the investment incurred towards power generation equipment, and a variable cost or the cost of fuel.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe government is contemplating introducing a fixed component in the renewable energy tariff to prevent states from backing down from buying electricity from renewable energy sources,\u201d said a person aware of the development, on conditions of anonymity.\u000a\u000aMint reported on 14 January about issues such as inordinate delays in signing of power purchase agreements, timely payments and power distribution companies shying away from procuring electricity generated from wind energy projects as some of the issues plaguing the renewable energy sector.\u000a\u000aALSO READ | Centre calls national review meet to push clean energy projects\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea is to fix a certain component which will allow a renewable energy project developer to service the debts even if the distribution companies (discoms) back down from buying electricity. It is under consideration,\u201d said a government official, who too sought anonymity.\u000a\u000aExperts say this is an important step for promoting green energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile this is a positive development for attracting investments, appropriate planning, demand projection for procurement strategies, commercial contracts and safeguarding utilities and consumers\u2019 interest must be thought through,\u201d said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner (energy) at PwC India.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s demand for renewable energy is expected to grow by seven times in 2035, according to the latest BP Energy Outlook, which means the share of renewable energy in the country\u2019s fuel mix will increase from 2% to 8% in 2035.\u000a\u000aIndia, the third-largest energy consumer after the US and China, plans to achieve 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022 as part of its global climate change commitments.\u000a\u000aIndia is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the US and China but renewable energy accounts for 15% of the total installed capacity.\u000a\u000aThe government says India has a renewable energy potential of around 900GW.\u000a\u000aQueries sent via email to the spokesperson of the ministry of new and renewable energy on Friday remained unanswered.

VIndia has an ambitious target of 175 gigawatts (GW) of solar, wind and other renewable energy by 2022. The financial needs are mammoth and India needs to look beyond fiscal allocations if the signals for clean energy have to be bold and consistent. Solar, alone, would require $100 billion in debt to reach 100 GW. International debt markets, estimated at $95 trillion, are the world\u2019s largest pool of capital and need to be made accessible to Indian developers at affordable cost. The budget must be evaluated against this scale of need and opportunity. The role of public funds should be to either catalyse action, attract investment, or underwrite risk.\u000a\u000aLet us first examine fiscal priorities to catalyse action. Compared to last year (Rs5,036 crore), this year the allocation to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy stands at Rs5,473 crore. As much as 74% of the outlay is directed to grid-interactive renewables, specifically mentioning the second phase of solar park development for 20 GW of capacity. The total budget is further split between Rs3,361 crore for solar and only Rs408 crore for wind, a clear indication that the government will continue to prioritise solar. Additionally, the budget extends support to power 2,000 railway stations through solar, under the Indian Railways 1GW solar mission. Smaller sums of Rs135 crore and Rs76 crore have been earmarked for small hydro and bio-power, respectively. Despite recent suggestions, large hydro remains outside the purview of renewable energy.\u000a\u000aOne continuing area of uncertainty is the role of the National Environment Fund (NEF). The cess on coal remained unchanged at Rs400/tonne. While the total cess collected (projected up to 31 March 2017) was a mammoth Rs54,336 crore, only Rs25,810 crore have been transferred to NEF. Of this, under half (Rs12,427 crore) has been spent on renewable energy projects. While nearly all of the budgetary allocation to renewables in 2017-18 will be from NEF, the budget could have clarified the proportion of the cess that would be transferred to NEF.\u000a\u000aAnother uncertainty is how the goods and services tax (GST) will impact renewables. Researchers at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) find that if solar components were categorised based on current levied tax rates (including exemptions and subsidies), GST would impact solar tariffs minimally. However, if preferential tax benefits to renewable energy were not accounted, then GST could raise utility scale solar tariffs by as much as 9.5%, hampering progress.\u000a\u000aHow has the budget performed in attracting new investment? Two market opportunities stood to gain significantly from strategic budgetary support. First, residential rooftop projects could create 15 GW of renewable energy capacity in India by 2022. While budgetary support was extended for housing infrastructure, no direct support was announced for rooftop solar.\u000a\u000aSecondly, replacing 15% of India\u2019s irrigation pumps with solar pumps could build 20 GW of capacity. Aiming to double farmer incomes within four years, the budget discusses mainstreaming and interlinking Primary Agriculture Credit Societies with District Central Cooperative Banks. If this increases access to low-cost loans, the incentive to invest in the upfront capital expense for solar pumps could increase.\u000a\u000aThe budget\u2019s real test lay in its approach to mitigating financial risk in the renewable energy, where capital costs are high, payback periods are long and off-taker, construction and foreign exchange risks raise cost of debt significantly. CEEW research shows that 70% of the costs embedded in already low solar tariffs owe to return on equity and debt servicing. But no budgetary support was extended to any agency to address risks. Moreover, financial support to the Solar Energy Corporation of India, the nodal agency for commissioning many solar and wind projects, has been halved to Rs50 crore.\u000a\u000aNor has the budget given any impetus to technology development. Only Rs144 crore has been budgeted for research and development, nearly half of last year\u2019s allocation. A recent CEEW study showed that energy storage has a number of current commercial applications for telecom towers, petrol pumps, commercial establishments, rural ATMs, and academic institutions. Yet, funding remains constrained. In 2016-17 Rs 20 crore was allocated for developing, testing and deploying energy storage technologies. In 2017-18 there is no allocation for energy storage, which could exacerbate challenges with integrating renewable energy into the grid. Again, despite some focus on transport infrastructure, no allowances have been made for electric vehicles or biofuels. While total budgetary outlay to renewable energy marginally increased, there is little to celebrate. This budget is unlikely to catalyse action, attract private investment or underwrite risks. An opportunity was lost.\u000a\u000aDr. Arunabha Ghosh is CEO and Kanika Chawla is Senior Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (http://ceew.in), one of South Asia\u2019s leading independent think-tanks.

VDEHRADUN: In order to implement the State Action Plan of Climate Change (SAPCC) in which the Himalayan state was among the first in the country to submit the report to the Union environment ministry in 2014 and launch it in June last year, a budget of Rs 2.5 crore has been sanctioned by the Centre. RN Jha, chief conservator of forests and nodal officer State Climate Change Centre (SCCC), said, \u201cDepartment of Science and Technology (DST) has recently sanctioned a budget of Rs 2.5 crore for SAPCC . DST which is heading the programme National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system is concerned about Himalayas and has created task force pertaining to agriculture, climate, biodiversity, water and traditional knowledge sectors to lay out developmental policies for these sectors which are viable for fragile eco-system\u201d.A workshop was held in the city by SCCC for representatives of various state government departments to learn about SAPCC and policies intervention required to achieve the target of Intended National Determined Contributions (INDC).According to Rashmi Bajaj, consultant of United Nations Development Programe, the states have to contribute to meet the targets of INDC of Paris climate summit which involve both mitigation measures such as production of energy through renewable energy sources as well as adaptation measures for more investment in vulnerable sectors such as water, agriculture for policy intervention. So the representatives of different state departments participated in the workshop to learn about implementation of INDC in their policies.However, tourism and irrigation departments have already taken lead in adapting to vulnerability and risk assessment (VRA) study carried out by SCCC in their development plan Anjali Semwal, environment consultant for tourism department said, they have selected 31 villages, listed under VRA, for eco-tourism development. \u201cInstead of hotels, we would promote homestays and activities such as bird tourism, jungle safari, trek etc in these 31 villages which would benefit the communities as well.\u201dNK Sharma, chief engineer of Irrigation department said, the department have begun working on recharging the ground water and saving the run off water in hills and plains with various methodologies which would replenish the depleted water sources for irrigation purpose.

VNew Delhi: The fine print of Union budget 2017-18 has served incentives for the energy sector such as lowering the tax burden on carbon trading gains and making it more attractive for foreign oil firms to store crude oil in India\u2019s strategic reserves.\u000a\u000aThe incentives seek to support energy security and climate change goals of the country after having decisively departed from petroleum subsidies.\u000a\u000aUnion finance minister Arun Jaitley has proposed to cut the tax on gains from carbon trading to 10% from 30% in a move expected to make investments into energy efficiency and clean energy more rewarding. The minister also extended the income tax exemption to foreign companies storing crude oil in India\u2019s strategic reserves to any gains from sale of such oil even after expiry of the company\u2019s contract with the Indian government. At the moment, this benefit is limited only during the contract period.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) set up under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) allows investors in emission-reducing projects to generate tradable credits corresponding to the volume of emission reduction achieved. These credits can be sold to industrialized countries. So far, the income tax department has been treating the income on transfer of carbon credits as business income, subject to a 30% tax. Jaitley has proposed that it shall be a concessional 10% and applicable surcharge and cess. This amendment will take effect from the 2017-18 financial year.\u000a\u000aThe move to incentivize clean energy projects comes parallelly with gradual increase in taxes on petroleum products and the cess on coal, making India one of the leaders in climate change action. Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased excise duty on branded petrol from Rs15.5 a litre to Rs22.7 a litre as of December 2016 and on branded diesel from Rs5.8 a litre to Rs19.7 a litre, pointed out the Economic Survey 2016-17.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel,\u201d the survey pointed out.\u000a\u000aAshish Khanna, chief executive officer of Tata Power Solar Systems Ltd, said the budget demonstrated the government\u2019s commitment to being a front runner in renewable sources of energy.\u000a\u000aIn line with the government\u2019s stated objective of phasing out corporate tax exemptions in order to be able to moderate the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25%, Jaitley did not extend the income tax incentive for power projects under section 80 IA after it expires on 31 March 2017. Those who complete power projects before this deadline will, however, be able to claim full deduction of income from the project while calculating the company\u2019s taxable income for 10 years.

VIn a bid to harness solar energy, Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL) has planned to install solar panels on Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar metro corridor to meet its electricity requirements. It plans to generate approximately 2.30 mega watt peak (mwp) by installing these solar panels.\u000a\u000aAccording to the company officials, these solar panels would be installed on rooftops of Andheri and Ghatkopar stations in the first phase and later be put up in the rest of the stations. \u201cThe electricity generated from these solar panels will be utilised for non-traction use like lighting, air-conditioning and maintenance. Mumbai Metro One\u2019s auxiliary power requirement for non-traction use is 6.9 mw, 30 per cent of which will be met with solar energy once the system is up and running,\u201d read a statement from MMOPL.\u000a\u000aIt has already initiated the installation of light-emitting diode (LED) lights at all its metro stations, depot, and administrative buildings to reduce consumption of electricity. \u201cThe installation of solar panels and LED lights will save carbon footprint of approximately 2,430 tons per year. Our initiative to harness solar power for meeting a part of our electricity needs is to reinforce our commitment to the green cause,\u201d an MMOPL spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aAlso read: Mumbai Metro Phase 4 may cover entire Ghodbunder Road stretch in Thane

The country\u2019s milk production has been steadily increasing with 2015-16 recording an output of 160 MT, the impact of rising temperatures, especially on cross-bred cows will make the task of meeting domestic demand difficult and could eventually lead to a decline in per capita consumption, industry experts said at the 45th Dairy Industry Conference, organised by Indian Dairy Association (West Zone) at Mumbai.\u000a\u000aWATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS\u000a\u000a\u201cThe dairy sector is likely to be affected both directly and indirectly by climate change. While stress to animals caused by changes in temperature-humidity index would directly affect milk production, indirect effects include feed and water availability being impacted by adverse climate events,\u201d National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) Chairman Dilip Rath said.\u000a\u000aHeat stress also impacts animal reproduction adversely as levels of above the acceptable levels can impact conception rates.\u000a\u000aResearch indicates that stress from heat can cause decline in milk yield in the range of 10 to 30 per cent in first lactation and 5-20 per cent and second and third lactation and both the heat waves and cold waves can cause short to long term cumulative heat effect on milk production in cattle and buffaloes, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs climate change is a challenge that impacts all of us, our dairy sector must not only evolve adaptation strategies but also help in mitigation by contributing to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the dairy sector,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aMilk is India\u2019s single largest agricultural commodity in value terms surpassing even the combined value of the two principal cereal crops and has helped million of rural households pursue livelihoods, Rath said, adding, \u201cwe need to proactively protect our milk producers from the adverse consequences of climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndia is self-sufficient in milk and world\u2019s largest milk producer accounting for about 18 per cent of the world\u2019s milk production.

VJUNAGADH: Scientists at Junagadh Agriculture University\u2019s (JAU) wheat research station have successfully developed a new variety of wheat that is heat tolerant and suitable for growing in saline soil conditions. What\u2019s more, the new variety would enhance the taste of chappatis and would be best suited for making breads!The discovery is expected to come as a boon for large number of farmers who have to take desperate steps to salvage their standing crop even when temperature rises by even few notches. Moreover, the new variety named GJW 463 also yields more wheat per hectare as compared to the exisiting varieties, scientists said.Dr AR Pathak, vice chancellor, JAU told TOI: \u201cMany farmers in Saurashtra sow wheat as early as last week of October to avoid the impact of unpredictable heat and drought periods on germination. They also want to take advantage of available irrigation water in the well or bores in the beginning of Rabi season. In later part of the season, these main water sources ar exhausted. Therefore, there was a need to have better yielding varieties with quality grains suitable for early as well as timely sowing conditions which can replace older varieties. We have successfully developed new GJW 463 wheat variety which is heat tolerance and can withstand salinity too.\u201dDr Kamlesh Dabhi , a scientist at the wheat research station, said, \u201cClimate change has become a serious threat for agriculture and development of such variety was the need of the hour. The new variety gives more yield per hectare as compared to all popular wheat varieties in the state besides it is heat and salinity tolerance qualities.\u201d\u201cIf this variety is sown in first week of November, farmers can get 55.75 quintal per hectare and during regular sowing season (November 15 to 25), they can harvest 50.91 quintal per hectare,\u201d said Dabhi.The qualities of this new variety have been approved under All India Coordinated Research Project.

VFor the fourth consecutive year, has forecast a drop in its carbon dioxide (CO2) emission levels, said environment organisation Greenpeace East Asia's report on Tuesday.\u000a\u000ais the world's top emitter of CO2, followed by the US.\u000a\u000aThe report, which was an analysis of China's National Energy Administration forecasts for 2017, said that the reduction in CO2 was by approximately one per cent.\u000a\u000a"This would be the fourth year in a row of either zero growth or a decline in CO2 emissions... this reinforces China's growing status as a global climate leader, and sends a strong signal to US President (Donald) Trump," Greenpeace said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency 2011 report, was responsible for 28 per cent of the total global CO2 emission coming from the fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aThis was followed by the US at 16 per cent, while India was responsible for 6 per cent of carbon emission.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Greenpeace said that while Trump's administration vows to backtrack from the global climate change initiatives (including the Paris Agreement), China with its increasing renewable energy sector was now in the race for world environment leadership.\u000a\u000a"The US should be one of the countries leading the world on climate action, doubling down on renewable energy and drastically cutting emissions. Instead, we are a global roadblock, thanks to Trump and his cabinet of billionaires," Greenpeace's US Executive Director Annie Leonard said.\u000a\u000aA 2016 report released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that China's fall in coal use over past two years was equal to Japan's total yearly coal consumption.\u000a\u000a"Data released in January shows that China is also smashing records for solar panel installations, installing enough panels to cover three football pitches every single hour of the year," Greenpeace said.\u000a\u000aGreenpeace East claims that China was virtually certain to overachieve its 2020 climate targets.\u000a\u000a"After almost two decades of relentless growth, China's CO2 emissions have remained stable since 2013, after levelling off in 2014 and falling for the first time in 2015," Greenpeace said.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, China's total energy consumption grew 1.4 per cent, however, the country managed to drop the coal consumption by approximately 1.3 per cent, while coal output shrank by a dramatic 9 per cent.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the non-fossil energy continued to grow at a rapid 12 per cent, meeting China's electricity demand growth since 2013.\u000a\u000aDuring the Marrakech Climate Talks (Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) held in November 2016, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a global scientific analysis, produced by three international research organisations also praised China for reducing its carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aHowever, the report also pointed out the absence of commitments on other greenhouse gases in China, due to which the emissions would continue to increase until at least 2030.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000akd/in/vt\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VBEIJING: China 's consumption of coal fell in 2016 for a third year in a row, official data showed Tuesday, as the world's top carbon polluter has emerged as a global leader in addressing global warming The National Bureau of Statistics said the consumption of coal, a major source of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, fell by 4.7 percent last year, according to preliminary calculations.The bureau said the share of coal in China's total energy consumption mix fell to 62 percent in 2016 from 64 percent the year before. A revised figure in the China Energy Statistical Yearbook put the 2015 figure at 63.7 percent, but Tuesday's report referenced the preliminary figures reported last year.While China is the world's biggest consumer of coal, its consumption levels have dropped as economic growth slows to its lowest level since 1990. With its major cities gripped by choking air pollution, China has also aimed to reduce coal usage in favor of natural gas and renewable energy including hydro, wind and solar power.Directives in January from the National Energy Administration ordered the cancellation of about 100 coal-fired power plants planned across the country. Construction had already started on some.As the world's second-largest economy , China is the top emitter of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, with the globe's leading economy, the United States, in second place.China's tackling of climate change in collaboration with the United States under President Barack Obama was touted by Beijing and Washington as a bright spot in a relationship beset by trade and security tensions. Crucially, the two countries joined last year to endorse the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change.That limited partnership has now grown uncertain under new President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a Chinese hoax and pledged to reverse Obama's efforts to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants.Trump said during his campaign that he would ``cancel'' the Paris Agreement and withdraw American tax dollars from U.N. global warming programs.Greenpeace said an analysis of data from the National Energy Administration showed an expected ``significant drop'' in China's CO2 emissions of 1 percent this year, in what it said would be the fourth consecutive year of zero growth or a decline.The decline ``reinforces China's growing status as a global climate leader, and sends a strong signal to U.S. President Trump that his dirty energy agenda will send the American economy in the wrong direction,'' Greenpeace said.Lauri Myllyvirta, senior coal campaigner for Greenpeace, said China's stable and falling carbon emissions have ``completely revolutionized the prospects for bringing global emissions and bringing climate change under control.''``The two reasons why global emissions have been stable for the past three years are no growth in China and rapid fall in emissions in the U.S., so that really shows what can be accomplished when these two countries work together,'' Myllyvirta said.China's decline in coal use, however, did not signal an overall drop in energy consumption. The country's total use of energy rose by the equivalent of 4.36 billion tons of standard coal, an increase of 1.4 percent over the previous year, the statistics bureau said. Consumption of crude oil increased by 5.5 percent and natural gas by 8 percent, the bureau said. Overall consumption of electricity from all sources rose by 5 percent, it said.Consumption of renewable sources accounted for 19.7 percent of the total energy mix, up 1.7 percent from the year before. While solar and wind power are growing more prominent, most renewable energy comes from dams whose environmental impact is beginning to draw more attention. China has suspended approvals for new hydroelectric projects in the mountainous southwestern province of Yunnan following concerns about the impact on the local ecosystem.Meanwhile, production of coal fell by 9 percent to 3.41 billion tons last year. China has for years been closing smaller, less efficient and more dangerous coal mines in a bid to boost productivity in the sector.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe forecast from the India Meteorological Department of above-normal temperatures over much of India in the summer months is bound to bring back memories of last year\u2019s withering weeks. Global weather in recent times has come under pressure from the El Nino warming that began in 2015 and exerted its influence into the first quarter of 2016. What is significant is that the Australian international weather bureau says there is a 50% prospect of a similar phenomenon this year as well, making it a significant alert on hotter temperatures, and possibly a debilitated monsoon and weaker agricultural prospects. The early IMD forecast should help the official machinery to adequately prepare for public distress. A carefully planned school examination schedule could spare students the worst of the torrid season, and this should be among the top priorities. As the temperature edged past 40C last year, schools in some States decided to extend their summer vacations by a week or two, something that may become necessary again. Urban water distress poses another challenge, because big cities in several States have not received adequate rainfall to replenish their reservoirs and are using up groundwater at unsustainable rates. For farmers, another harsh period would add to their difficulties, requiring a sensitive approach to their needs. Administrative decisions for summer management will need to be refined on the basis of coming IMD updates, although the overall trend appears to be clear.\u000a\u000aTemperatures in different parts of the world may have variations due to local weather phenomena, but as the U.S. space agency NASA has pointed out, there has been a record three-year warming trend, with 2016 the hottest; 16 of 17 warmest years based on globally-averaged temperatures occurred since 2001. The effect of El Nino on the global temperature average is only a small part of the overall rise, indicating that the trend could be correlated with the rise in greenhouse gases. India, a major emitter of GHGs, has classified 2016 as the century\u2019s warmest year, with an increase of 0.91C over the long-term average; NASA\u2019s corresponding global figure is 0.99C. These are clear signs that the world must shift away from further high-emission pathways in the economy and adopt leapfrogging technologies. It is also a call for policy initiatives to build resilience by improving water harvesting and expanding tree cover, including in cities. For rural India, building surface irrigation facilities such as ponds through the employment guarantee scheme and climate funds would seem a natural choice, while urban water supply augmentation needs more reservoirs to be built. If this year\u2019s forecast comes true, though, there is no escape route. The only hope would be an early date with the monsoon.

VBONN, Germany (Reuters) - Climate activists will argue in an Oslo court this week that Norway\u2019s plans for Arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional, in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation\u2019s founding principles to limit warming.\u000a\u000aA fishing boat enters the harbour at the Arctic port of Svolvaer in northern Norway March 4, 2013. REUTERS/Alister Doyle\u000a\u000aThe cases, including one in the United States where a group of young people are arguing that global warming threatens their Fifth Amendment right to life, liberty and property, are widening the scope of environmental litigation.\u000a\u000aSome legal scholars say it is a stretch to invoke the Constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases. Governments including the U.S. Trump administration and Norway are dismissive.\u000a\u000aStill, some cases have succeeded, such as a 2015 case that told the Dutch government to cut greenhouse emissions.\u000a\u000aAnd worldwide, 90 national constitutions have some sort of provisions guaranteeing environmental protection. Article 112 of Norway\u2019s constitution speaks of safeguarding a healthy environment for future generations.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want the court to recognize that climate change is not some side issue but a fundamental core issue,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace whose lawyers will go to court in Oslo from Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe constitution represents those basic rights,\u201d she told Reuters in Bonn, Germany, where almost 200 nations are working on ways to bolster the 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump decided in June to pull out.\u000a\u000aThe Norwegian case, brought by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group, argues that a 2015 oil licensing round in the Arctic violates the constitution because Norway has agreed to the Paris accord\u2019s goals to end the fossil fuel era this century.\u000a\u000aNorway\u2019s attorney general argues that the oil licenses, awarded to Statoil, Chevron, Lukoil, ConocoPhillips and others, have no link to the Constitution. Norway\u2019s environmental laws are among the toughest in the world.\u000a\u000aThe plaintiffs\u2019 case is based on \u201ca distinctly broad, political, and expanded interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s article 112,\u201d the Attorney General\u2019s office said in court documents.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists say the case is far more than a stunt. Losing could mean having to pay the state\u2019s legal fees, meaning a total bill exceeding $500,000.\u000a\u000aWorldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits related to climate change in 25 nations, a U.N. study said in March.\u000a\u000aAmong them, a Peruvian farmer launched an appeal in Germany on Monday, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions by energy utility RWE are partly to the blame for melting an Andean glacier that is threatening to cause floods.\u000a\u000aA lower court last year rejected his call for compensation.\u000a\u000aCases have risen since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Adding relevance, researchers increasingly say that greenhouse gas emissions have raised the risks of individual extreme events, from heat waves in Europe to downpours in India.\u000a\u000aThat could herald more claims.\u000a\u000aSUPERSTORM SANDY\u000a\u000a\u201cFlooding in New York after superstorm Sandy (in 2012) would have been less severe without a rise in sea levels,\u201d said Michiel Shaeffer, science director of research group Climate Analytics.\u000a\u000aStill, courts are a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d to try to force change on climate policies, said Oonagh Fitzgerald, a legal expert at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Canada.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd for a lot of people it seems far-fetched\u201d to link climate change with fundamental rights, she said.\u000a\u000aKiran Oommen, aged 20, is among 21 young plaintiffs in the U.S. case accusing the government of allowing emissions of greenhouse gases to rise even when it knew they could disrupt the climate.\u000a\u000aHe said that rising seas threatened his uncle and aunt\u2019s home in Florida and his brother developed allergies because of high pollen levels in Oregon linked to warmer temperatures.\u000a\u000aThe court case is due to start on Feb. 5, after judges rejected attempts by both the Obama and Trump U.S. administrations to have it dismissed.\u000a\u000aAnd the Dutch government is appealing against a 2015 court ruling that ordered it to slash emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, more deeply than planned, to care for its citizens.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe relevant question in all these cases is \u2018is there an obligation on a state that goes further than what the laws of parliament say?\u2019\u201d said Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel of the Urgenda Foundation which represented 900 co-plaintiffs.\u000a\u000aHe said legal arguments in the Dutch case were based mainly on the civil code, backed up by the Constitution, which obliges authorities \u201cto keep the country habitable and to protect and improve the environment.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith extra reporting by Gwladys Fouche and Terje Solsvik in Oslo; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Toby Chopra

VFrom rising levels of air pollution to increased water contamination and a widening range for disease-carrying mosquitoes, climate change is making people sick, a coalition of 11 US medical groups said Wednesday.\u000a\u000aKnown as the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, the group represents more than half of US doctors, and aims to help policy makers understand the health dangers of global warming, and what must be done to guard against it in the coming years.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctors in every part of our country see that climate change is making Americans sicker,\u201d said Mona Sarfaty, a physician and director of the new consortium.\u000a\u000a\u201cPhysicians are on the frontlines and see the impacts in exam rooms. What\u2019s worse is that the harms are felt most by children, the elderly, Americans with low-income or chronic illnesses, and people in communities of colour.\u201d\u000a\u000aA report on climate change and health points out that infectious diseases can spread more widely as ticks carrying Lyme disease and mosquitoes with West Nile virus expand their range. (AFP/iStock)\u000a\u000aThe group is releasing a report that highlights the ways climate change affects health, and calls for a speedy transition to clean renewable energy. The report, called \u201cMedical Alert! Climate Change is Harming Our Health,\u201d will be circulated to members of the Republican-dominated Congress.\u000a\u000aSome of its key warnings relate to heart and breathing problems associated with increasing wildfires and air pollution, as well as injury from extreme heat events.\u000a\u000aInfectious diseases can spread more widely as ticks carrying Lyme disease and mosquitoes with West Nile virus expand their range. Extreme weather, such as hurricanes and droughts, may become more common, destroying not only homes and livelihoods but also wreaking havoc on people\u2019s mental health, it warned.\u000a\u000aMost Americans are not aware that increases in asthma attacks and allergies are linked to climate change, according to the report. A poll from 2014 suggested that only one in four Americans could name even one way in which climate change is harming our health.\u000a\u000aPeople are not powerless, the group urged. They can push for a quicker transition to renewable solar and wind energy, and also do what they can to walk and bike more instead of driving.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere\u2019s the message from America\u2019s doctors on climate change: it\u2019s not only happening in the Arctic Circle, it\u2019s happening here,\u201d said Sarfaty. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a problem for us in 2100, it\u2019s a problem now.

VAustralia's iconic Great Barrier Reef may be saved only if immediate action is taken to curb global warming, say scientists who are conducting aerial and underwater surveys as an unprecedented mass coral bleaching event unfolds for the second year in a row.\u000a\u000aA new study published in the Nature journal has warned that the reef's resilience is rapidly waning.\u000a\u000aWhile protecting reefs from fishing, and improving water quality is likely to help bleached reefs recover in the longer term, the study also showed that it made no difference to the amount of bleaching during the extreme heatwave of 2016.\u000a\u000aScientists from ten research institutions representing Australia's National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, have returned to the reef only one year after scorching temperatures caused the worst coral bleaching event on record in 2016.\u000a\u000aTeams will spend the next few weeks in the air and underwater measuring the extent of the damage from this summer compared to last.\u000a\u000a"We're hoping that the next 2-3 weeks will cool off quickly, and this year's bleaching won't be anything like last year. The severity of the 2016 bleaching was off the chart," said Terry Hughes, from ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.\u000a\u000a"It was the third major bleaching to affect the Great Barrier Reef, following earlier heatwaves in 1998 and 2002. Now we're gearing up to study a potential number four," Hughes said.\u000a\u000a"We have now assessed whether past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 made reefs any more tolerant in 2016. Sadly, we found no evidence that past bleaching makes the corals any tougher," he said.\u000a\u000a"Average sea-surface temperatures for the Australian summer 2016 were the highest ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef," said Janice Lough, Senior Principal Research Scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\u000a\u000a"In each of the three events since 1998, the pattern of bleaching matches exactly where the warmest water was each year. That allows us to predict when and where bleaching is likely to occur this year," Lough said.\u000a\u000a"The bleaching in 2016 strongly reinforces the urgent need to limit climate change as agreed by world leaders in the Paris Agreement, and fully implement the Reef 2050 Plan to boost the Reef's resilience," said David Wachenfeld from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.\u000a\u000a"It broke my heart to see so many corals dying on northern reefs on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016," said Hughes.\u000a\u000a"With rising temperatures due to global warming, it's only a matter of time before we see more of these events. A fourth event after only one year is a major blow to the reef," he said.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VChicago - Environmental groups that vowed to fight President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back his predecessor's plans to curb global warming made good on their promise Wednesday, teaming up with an American Indian tribe to ask a federal court to block an order that lifts restrictions on coal sales from federal lands.\u000a\u000aThe Interior Department last year placed a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands to review the climate change impacts of burning the fuel and whether taxpayers were getting a fair return. But Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order that included lifting the moratorium, and also initiated a review of former President Barack Obama's signature plan to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists say lifting the moratorium will worsen climate change and allow coal to be sold for unfairly low prices.\u000a\u000a"It's really just a hail Mary to a dying industry," said Jenny Harbine, an Earthjustice attorney who filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Montana on behalf of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, Sierra Club, and Center for Biological Diversity.\u000a\u000aThe White House did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. The Department of Justice declined comment.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental groups have been preparing for months to fight the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks, including by hiring more lawyers and raising money. Trump, who has called global warming a "hoax" invented by the Chinese, said during his campaign that he would kill Obama's climate plans and bring back coal jobs.\u000a\u000aAdvocates said they also will work to mobilize public opposition to the executive order, saying they expect a backlash from Americans who worry about climate change.\u000a\u000a"This is not what most people elected Trump to do," said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Poll after poll shows that the public supports climate action."\u000a\u000aA poll released in September found 71 percent of Americans want the U.S. government to do something about global warming, including 6 percent who think the government should act even though they are not sure that climate change is happening. That poll, which also found most Americans are willing to pay a little more each month to fight global warming, was conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.\u000a\u000aWhile Republicans have blamed Obama-era environmental regulations for the loss of coal jobs, federal data show that U.S. mines have been losing jobs for decades because of automation and competition from natural gas; solar panels and wind turbines now can produce emissions-free electricity cheaper than burning coal.\u000a\u000aBut many people in coal country are counting on the jobs that Trump has promised, and industry advocates praised his orders.\u000a\u000a"These executive actions are a welcome departure from the previous administration's strategy of making energy more expensive through costly, job-killing regulations that choked our economy," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue.\u000a\u000aTrump's order also will initiate a review of efforts to reduce methane emissions in oil and natural gas production, and will rescind Obama-era actions that addressed climate change and national security and efforts to prepare the country for the impacts of climate change. The administration still is deciding whether to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change.\u000a\u000aAnd on Wednesday, the administration asked a federal appeals court to postpone a ruling on lawsuits over the Clean Power Plan, the Obama initiative to limit carbon from power plants, saying it could be changed or rescinded.\u000a\u000aA coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia said they will oppose any effort to withdraw the plan or seek dismissal of a pending legal case, while environmental advocates said they're also ready to step in to defend environmental laws if the U.S. government does not.\u000a\u000a"The president doesn't get to simply rewrite safeguards; they have to ... prove the changes are in line with the law and science," said the NRDC's Goldston. "I think that's going to be a high hurdle for them."\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists say Trump's actions will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to other countries that are embracing clean energy, which they say could create thousands of new jobs.\u000a\u000aEven so, they believe efforts to revive coal ultimately will fail because many states and industries already have been switching to renewable energy or natural gas.\u000a\u000a"Those decisions are being made at the state level and plant by plant," said Earthjustice President Trip Van Noppen, who said his group is "continuing to work aggressively to retire dirty coal plants."\u000a\u000a"Coal is not coming back," Van Noppen added. "While the president is taking big splashy action, he is actually doomed to fail."\u000a\u000a___\u000a\u000aBrown reported from Billings, Montana.

VFor perspective, that would have been equivalent to taking 70% of the cars in the US off the roads.\u000a\u000aWhile the Indian Supreme Court batted for the environment by banning the sale of BS-III vehicles\u2014the new pollution standards for vehicles, BS-IV, kick in from April \u2014despite considerable opposition from automobile majors, the US set the world several steps back in its fight against climate change on Tuesday. Though the US is the world\u2019s largest emitter of CO2 in per capita terms and the second-highest in terms of volume, president Trump signed an executive order that dismantles Obama-era measures to reduce America\u2019s emissions. The order directs US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to redraft the Clean Power Plan, that aimed to get coal-fired power generations plants\u2014these are the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the country, accounting for nearly a third of the total emissions\u2014to cut their emissions by 32% over 2005 levels by 2030. For perspective, that would have been equivalent to taking 70% of the cars in the US off the roads.\u000a\u000aTrump, who has proposed cutting the EPA\u2019s budget by a third and has expressly denied anthropogenic climate change, wants the burden on electricity generators reduced significantly \u2013 to \u201cend the war on coal \u2026 and the theft of American prosperity\u201d, as his administration argues. The order also envisages a lifting of the moratorium on coal leasing and ends the requirement that federal officials factor in climate-change impact while taking key decisions. Coal mining jobs in the US that number around 75,000 today have been declining, and the present dispensation at the Oval Office has hinged its rhetoric to creating more jobs for Americans.\u000a\u000aThe regulatory relaxations Trump is promising may help improve the health of coal companies, 50 of which have filed for bankruptcy since 2012. A Washington Post analysis which argues most of these measures are unlikely to disrupt the broader trend of a shift of the electricity mix in the country away from coal and towards natural gas and renewables offers some hope.\u000a\u000aAlso Watch:\u000a\u000aIt is, of course, not surprising the Trump administration would shrug off climate concerns, given the president\u2019s pre-election rhetoric. While Scott Pruitt, the\u000a\u000aTrump-select who heads EPA, wants to drastically limit the regulator\u2019s powers and jurisdiction\u2014he also believes that CO2 is not a \u201cprimary contributor\u201d to global warming\u2014the Republicans have introduced a one-line Bill in the Congress, HR 861, that reads: \u201cThe Environmental Protection Agency shall terminate on December 31, 2018.\u201d The Trump administration had also earlier announced that it would reconsider the strict emission and fuel-efficiency standards on cars and light trucks.\u000a\u000aThe fear, thus, is that the Trump administration could eventually upend a carefully negotiated global accord\u2014arrived at the Paris summit in 2015 where the US committed to cut its emissions by 25-28% over 2005 levels by 2025. Even though the executive order is silent on this\u2014the administration at the moment is divided on the issue\u2014there are enough signals from Trump that make it difficult to rule out the US reneging. Given the grave consequences of this\u2014other countries will almost certainly follow suit\u2014all efforts have to be made to convince president Trump of the disaster that awaits the world if temperatures rise by more than 2oC.

VThe Indo-Gangetic plain, India\u2019s most populous and fertile region, will face extreme climatic conditions such as severe droughts if the burning of fossil fuel continues unabated and government policies fail to intervene, a group of Indian and Chinese researchers has warned.\u000a\u000aThe droughts, a possible result of the reckless burning of fossil fuels combined with regional warming, will lead to a fall in agricultural produce, compromising India\u2019s food security, the researchers projected.\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t the only conclusion - because of dependency on the intensity of monsoon and the variability of government intervention, \u201cextreme wet events\u201d or floods will be a probability too.\u000a\u000aA two-year study was conducted by researchers attached to the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing, the Beijing Normal University and the University of Cambridge. The group comprised two Indians, five Chinese and one German.\u000a\u000a\u201cDissecting the projected change led to the conclusion that not only will incidences of climatological and extreme drought increase dramatically in the future, but extreme wet events will also become more probable due to increased variability, indicating that extreme events, including droughts and floods, will become more common in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,\u201d said Debashis Nath, one of the Indian reseachers.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the scientific journal Earth\u2019s Future in March, analysed climate data from the region between 1961 and 2012 and juxtaposed it against two scenarios till the end of this century. The first scenario was one where government and global policies led to increased irrigation and cut down the emission of greenhouse gases and the second whereby authorities failed to take those same steps and the region became vulnerable to climatic changes.\u000a\u000aThe situation is complicated by the fact that agriculture in India is mostly rain-fed.\u000a\u000aThe existing data analysed by the group was worrying in itself.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, the probability of drought is 45% and the region has become drought-prone in recent decades. Cereal production has declined from the year 2000, which is consistent with the increase in drought-affected areas from 20% to 25% to 50% to 60% before and after 2000,\u201d explained Reshmita Nath, one of the researchers attached to CAS.\u000a\u000aThe other Indian researcher, Debashis Nath, is also affiliated to CAS.\u000a\u000aThe team projected existing data on 27 different climate models followed by scientists across the world to look for future trends \u2013 and the result was consistent and grim.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that the area affected due to drought events will be higher during the global warming scenario and the frequency of extreme drought events will increase dramatically in the future,\u201d Nath said.\u000a\u000aThe researchers detailed several droughts and floods that have hit the region since 2000, which caused \u201cconsiderable losses including death, crop failure and eco-system destruction\u201d.\u000a\u000aThis study, they said in the published paper, should help the government to plan for \u201cagricultural adaptation strategies, advanced water management, and (protecting) human health\u201d in future.\u000a\u000aWhat did the study cover?\u000a\u000aThe region studied included Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, West Bengal and .parts of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.\u000a\u000aThis region is home to approximately 40% of India\u2019s population and yields approximately 50% of the country\u2019s total agricultural production.\u000a\u000aThe climate and agricultural data were sourced from the National Sample Survey Office and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN\u000a\u000aThe paper was published under the headline \u201cMultimodel Projections of Extreme Weather Events in the Humid Subtropical Gangetic Plain Region of India\u201d.

VLos Angeles, March 30 (IANS) A group of US scientists have predicted that 31 to 67 percent of Southern California beaches could be severely damaged due to rising sea levels by 2100, a new study has revealed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe study was published online on Wednesday by the American Geophysical Union in their Journal of Geophysical Research, Xinhua news agency reported.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real. The effect of California losing its beaches is not just a matter of affecting the tourism economy," Sean Vitousek, lead author of the study, said in a statement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human management efforts must increase in order to preserve them," said Vitousek.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScientists applied the "CoSMoS-COAST", a newly-developed shoreline change computer modelling system for coastal hazard assessment and management planning, to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 km of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Beaches in Southern California are a crucial feature of the economy, and the first line of defence against coastal storm impacts for the 18 million residents in the region. This study indicates that we will have to perform massive and costly interventions to preserve these beaches in the future under the erosive pressures of anticipated sea level rise, or risk losing many of the economic and protective benefits beaches provide," said US Geological Survey (USGS) geologist and co-author, Patrick Barnard.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the window to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius appears to be closing. Associated projections for sea-level rise generally range near or below 1 metre by 2100.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aksk/vm

VUnited Nations green panel chief Erik Solheim. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aUN green panel chief Erik Solheim has lauded India\u2019s efforts in embarking on a path to an \u201cinclusive green economy\u201d, saying that moving towards a low-carbon future would serve its own interests well. \u201cWhat we can see in India is a country beginning to embark on a path to an inclusive green economy because it makes perfect political and economic sense,\u201d Solheim told IANS in an email interaction from Arkhangelsk in Russia, where he is attending an international conference on development of the Arctic.\u000a\u000aPraising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director said the country has the potential to unlock huge development and growth with a shift to renewables. But India, he said, is facing multiple challenges.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a need to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty, address long-term energy security and cut urban air pollution. It simply cannot afford to conduct business as usual, because the arguments for this shift are so compelling.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Solheim, innovations in expanding solar energy in places like Tamil Nadu and Kerala send a very strong message that resonates across the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge private sector uptake. India revolutionised the information technology sector and I see no reason why it shouldn\u2019t do the same for renewable energy.\u201d Advocating renewable sources, Solheim said these \u201care the future\u201d and fossil fuels are the past.\u000a\u000aWatch this also:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cInnovations in how we harness wind and solar power and energy storage is also accelerating and pushing down prices. These sectors have established themselves as providers of greater energy security with more jobs, better quality jobs and better paid jobs.\u201d He said no country or company could afford to ignore this trend.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to embracing a low-carbon future and building a green economy, the train has already left the station. More importantly, countries like India and China are embarking on this journey not because they wish to please others, but because they are ultimately serving their own interests,\u201d he noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat means ensuring their citizens can breathe clean air. It means building resilient economies and ensuring long-term inclusive wealth,\u201d he said. For Solheim, who has spent a lifetime fighting for the environment, renewables are a major economic opportunity and not an obligation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn that respect I am convinced there is sufficient momentum and a strong incentive to stay on this path,\u201d he added.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIn March, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order, ostensibly promoting U.S. energy independence and economic growth, but with potential collateral damage to global efforts to limit climate change. What exactly did he authorise, what are its implications, and what does it mean for India\u2019s strategic interests in energy and climate change?\u000a\u000aThe executive order defines America\u2019s interest narrowly in terms of developing the country\u2019s energy resources. It establishes a time-bound process to review several Obama-era regulatory actions that might \u201cburden\u201d their development, and revokes certain actions. A centrepiece is a review of the U.S. Clean Power Plan, which aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the American electricity sector. This was a key element in President Barack Obama\u2019s plans to meet America\u2019s climate pledge under the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aOther actions lift a moratorium on leasing federal land for coal mining, and revisit rules to limit methane emissions. Yet another withdraws estimates of the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d, an economic approach that sets a dollar value to the gains from reducing carbon, providing a basis for further regulatory action. In brief, the aim is to invigorate domestic energy production but by setting the clock back to an era before any climate-focussed regulation, thereby giving a boost to coal, oil and gas production.\u000a\u000aFrom a virtuous to vicious cycle\u000a\u000aDespite green advocates in the U.S. putting on a brave face, the cumulative effects of these actions undoubtedly have implications for the trajectory of America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. They are correct in arguing that efforts to boost the coal industry are likely fruitless. Even without the Clean Power Plan, the falling price of wind and solar energy and the availability of cheap gas could signal the end of coal in the U.S. But the same cannot be said for efforts to limit methane. And the removal of the single agreed social cost of carbon as a basis for regulatory efforts hamstrings the effectiveness of other regulations. These orders set back climate mitigation efforts in the U.S. The only question is how much, and whether America\u2019s Paris Agreement pledge is still within reach.\u000a\u000aBut the deeper significance of the order rests in the political signal it sends to the world, and the reactions it may elicit. The Paris Agreement is, at the core, a confidence game. Each country is required to submit a national \u2018pledge\u2019 to limit emissions growth, which is to be reviewed internationally, and updated and enhanced every five years. The intent is to generate a virtuous cycle of enhanced actions over time, as countries gain confidence in each other\u2019s commitment to climate action.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s order risks turning a fragile global virtuous cycle into a vicious one; with global confidence punctured, other countries may follow the U.S. lead and dilute their national actions too. While the order is silent on America\u2019s formal commitment to the Paris Agreement for now, an explicit announcement on this is expected in May, when the G7 leaders are scheduled to meet. A formal withdrawal, though complex and time-consuming, could further dent appetite for collective action.\u000a\u000aFor veteran climate watchers, what makes this order particularly galling is that the Paris Agreement was, in substantial measure, written to accommodate the U.S. and enable its participation. And this is not the first time the U.S. has pulled the rug out from under the global community. In the mid-1990s, it notably walked away from the Kyoto Protocol, which requires developed countries to take the lead. With this order, as a senior U.S. government official put it: \u201cThe U.S. is going to pursue its interests as it sees fit\u201d based on \u201can America First energy policy.\u201d\u000a\u000aImplications for India\u000a\u000aIn this context, what are India\u2019s interests, and how best can it pursue them? It is certainly the case that the developed world has consistently taken on less leadership than it should have, and the global climate regime could be better moored in principles of equity in addressing climate change. It would be tempting to conclude that India could use the U.S. retreat to stage one of its own, go slow on its own obligations, and adopt an approach of benign neglect towards the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aHowever, this would be flawed and incomplete thinking. India\u2019s interests are best served by buttressing the Paris Agreement, using its mechanisms to hold to account the developed world, and maintaining its own pledges.\u000a\u000aIndia has a lot to gain from a virtuous cycle because it is extremely vulnerable to climate impacts. While the ability of the Paris Agreement to slow warming may be more modest than is ideal, it will certainly have more effect than no agreement at all.\u000a\u000aMoreover, India has little to gain from going slow on implementing its own pledge. India\u2019s greenhouse gas limitation pledge is appropriately cautious and, in key areas such as renewable energy promotion, existing domestic policy targets are more ambitious than India\u2019s Paris pledge. Its approach is based on accelerating a transition to renewable energy, which would bring gains in terms of energy security and air pollution. But in doing so, India importantly retains the right to meet its energy access needs and energy for development through fossil fuel use, particularly coal, if needed. The Paris Agreement does not constrain this approach, which is based on Indian interests.\u000a\u000aShould the Paris Agreement unravel, there will almost certainly be a push to re-negotiate a new agreement when political conditions in the U.S. change. At that time, developed country emissions will be lower, India\u2019s emissions will likely be rising faster than any other country, and it will have considerably more pressure to take on more ambitious pledges that could, in fact, risk constraining its energy choices.\u000a\u000aCould India\u2019s stance actually make a difference to global climate outcomes in the context of U.S. recalcitrance? Unambiguously yes. India is emerging as a swing player in global climate politics. With the U.S. adopting the role of the leading naysayer, the Chinese have skilfully stepped into the role of climate champions, reaffirming their own commitment to the Paris Agreement. As a large emerging country, whose yearly emissions follow only these two nations, India has enormous leverage as a deciding factor in the future of the Paris Agreement. It should insist that Western countries maintain their obligations, including financial. Indeed, the Trump order provides an opening to enhance India\u2019s global standing. Skilfully executed, such a climate position could even be useful in a larger foreign policy sense, serving as a soothing element in an otherwise fraught relationship with China, and signalling independent pursuit of interests to the Americans.\u000a\u000aHistory will likely judge the Trump order an own goal, born of the poisoned politics that prevails in the U.S. today. It will likely hurt the interests of the U.S. in the long run because it postpones an inevitable but complex readjustment of energy systems around renewable energy, undermines confidence in the U.S. as a reliable global partner, and even revokes preparation for climate impacts meant to safeguard American citizens. Fortunately, India is in a position to think and act more clearly. It should do so by re-affirming its Paris pledge and placing its weight behind implementing the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aNavroz K.

VAmong the initiatives rescinded by Trump is the Clean Power Plan that required the US to slash fossil fuels for energy production to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aThe 2015 Paris Agreement was built upon the foundation of countries pledging action to counter climate change. US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order overturning much of what his predecessor had promised can\u2019t come in its way as market dynamics will continue to push the US to a clean energy economy, a New York-based environmental advocacy group has said.\u000a\u000aIt believes that notwithstanding US plans, countries like India and China are continuing on the path to bring in low carbon development in their respective economies, which is not just good for curbing global warming but also offers a cleaner and healthier lifestyle.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe the US will likely stay in the Paris Agreement as the Trump team understands that being a global pariah on climate change will hurt their efforts with other countries on various issues,\u201d David Doniger, Director for Climate and Clean Air at the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), told IANS in an email interview.\u000a\u000aAmong the initiatives rescinded by Trump is the Clean Power Plan that required the US to slash fossil fuels for energy production to meet commitments under the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aDoniger, who played a crucial role in formulating the Montreal Protocol, an international pact designed to stop the depletion of the earth\u2019s ozone layer, said now is the time for countries like the India and China, as also the EU and others, to take the lead in continuing the progress on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cAddressing this issue is too critical for humanity so other countries can\u2019t afford to sit idly by as the current US administration sends troubling signs,\u201d he said. The Paris Agreement aims to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by cutting greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.\u000a\u000aWatch this also:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDoniger said the Paris Agreement was built upon the foundation of countries taking action that was in their own interests.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course, politics changes in countries at times, but these short-term changes shouldn\u2019t stop climate action. Any country that sits on the sidelines will realise that it is quickly left behind and it will become an outlier on the global stage. Being a global outcast makes it much harder to achieve other things with countries,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAt present, 141 countries have ratified the Paris Agreement that asks 197 signatory countries to reduce emissions to limit the rise in global temperature. An optimistic Doniger said coal power plants and coal mining are on the decline in the US.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s order doesn\u2019t change those trends, he said, as power companies are moving away from coal towards energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural gas.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese trends will continue even with this order as states move forward with clean energy policies, renewables continue to outcompete coal generation and market forces push towards more renewable energy.\u201d\u000a\u000aDoniger did not foresee any ramifications of the Trump order on emerging economies like India and China, especially when both are already on the path to low carbon emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Trump order shouldn\u2019t change the trajectory of clean energy in emerging economies. Both India and China are acting on clean energy because it\u2019s in their own interests and because their citizens will reap the benefits of stronger climate action.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo signals in the US should change that domestic motivation. In fact, we could see an even stronger motivation for climate action in these countries as they take on an even larger leadership role,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSignaling a court battle, Doniger said Trump\u2019s executive orders can\u2019t even stop the US action on climate.\u000a\u000a\u201cFinal rules can\u2019t be undone with the stroke of a pen and market dynamics will continue to shift the US to a clean energy economy despite President Trump\u2019s efforts. They can tear down these regulations only using the same legal process it took to build them. Their final decisions must pass muster in the courts.\u201d \u201cWe expect that this will end up in court,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe NRDC says the US electric power sector is in the midst of a significant transition. Solar and wind represented 65 percent of all capacity added in 2016 as both sources of renewable energy continued to surge.

VWASHINGTON: The landmark Paris climate pact was a bad deal for the US as it "front-loaded" its costs while India and China "back-loaded" theirs, causing a contraction in the American economy, the Trump administration has said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"What Paris represents is bad deal for this country. We front-loaded our costs. China and India back-loaded theirs. That caused a contraction in our economy," Scott Pruitt, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was quoted as saying by Fox News yesterday.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPruitt, however, called for continued engagement with the international community on the issue of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Engagement internationally is very important. To demonstrate the leadership that we have shown on this issue with China and India and other nations is very important. Those discussions should ensue," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe said that China and India have benefited from the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"When you look at what happened in Paris, at the Paris agreement and Paris accord, China and India weren't required to take any steps toward reduction of carbon di-oxide (CO2) until the year 2030," Pruitt said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"That discussion, to think that China and India are more committed to the CO2 reduction in this country I think is quite false," Pruitt claimed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAccording to the EPA administrator, the Trump administration has demonstrated its commitment to climate change through the steps it has taken.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Because of the technology, we can burn coal in clean fashion. We shouldn't have this commitment by the US government to say that fossil fuels are bad. Renewables are good. The US EPA and the US government should not pick winners and losers. That's what happened in the last several years," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPruitt asserted that fuel diversity is very important.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"We have shown leadership. We have made great progress with air quality since 1980. We made progress in the CO2 reduction side as well, at the same time, growing jobs. And so we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country. Neither does the President," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe said there is a warming trend in the climate change and the human activities contribute to the change in some measure.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe 2015 Paris agreement's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels.

VAtrauli: A dusty plastic sheet covers a large diesel generator in a corner of a petrol station in Atrauli, a village in Uttar Pradesh, a modest but telling sign of progress.\u000a\u000aThe gas station used to shut at 7pm every day because the lights would often go off, and there was no way to know when they would come back on, said Sudhakar Singh, the manager. \u201cThe main power supply was very irregular, and operating the generator was expensive, so we could not afford to stay open beyond 7pm,\u201d Singh told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, as motorbikes and trucks lined up for petrol and diesel.\u000a\u000aLast year, the pump got a connection to a solar mini-grid, a local power network not connected to the national grid, which guarantees six hours of electricity every day. The pump has since stayed open all night. \u201cNow, our expenses are lower and we earn more because we can stay open all night. We have not used the generator once since we got the ... connection,\u201d said Singh.\u000a\u000aPower paradox\u000a\u000aAtrauli\u2019s electricity revolution is a symbol of the energy paradox dogging India, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies, where power cuts are rampant and per capita electricity consumption is about a third the global average.\u000a\u000aFast-dropping costs for solar power, combined with plenty of sun and a huge need for electricity in a country where about 300 million people\u2014a quarter of the population\u2014are still without it means solar energy has huge potential in India.\u000a\u000aDespite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s pledge to supply power to every citizen by 2019 and a surge in solar production, reaching remote villages remains a challenge, with distribution losses as high as 30% on antiquated lines, low tariffs and limited use.\u000a\u000aMost of those without electricity live in the 99% of villages the government deems to be electrified because at least 10% of households and public places have electricity. But at least half the electrified households do not get at least six hours of electricity a day.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the grid has expanded and we generate enough power, distribution companies are not in a position to take that power, and are not interested in going into rural areas,\u201d said Aruna Kumarankandath at the Centre for Science and Environment. \u201cWhen the supply is so unreliable, people use it sparingly, making it an unattractive proposition to invest in,\u201d said Kumarankandath, a renewable energy researcher.\u000a\u000aLights, fans, action\u000a\u000aThe situation is particularly dire in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state where only 37% of households are electrified, compared with 67% nationwide.\u000a\u000aHelp has come from private mini-grids like the one in Atrauli operated by OMC Power, a company with 67 grids in the state. Renewable energy is key to India\u2019s electrification plan, and mini-grids with a capacity of 10 to 500 kilowatts (KW) are playing an increasingly important role.\u000a\u000a\u201cMini-grids use the potential of untapped renewable energy and manage demand efficiently by generating power at the source of consumption,\u201d said Kumarankandath.\u000a\u000aA base home package from OMC Power costs Rs110 a month and comes with a switchboard with an LED bulb and a socket for charging a mobile phone. Additional lights, fans and even a television can be added.\u000a\u000aA 50 KW solar grid with battery storage and a distribution reach of 5km can power small businesses, schools, two telecom towers and over 500 homes, said Sarraju N. Rao, chief technology officer at OMC Power. \u201cThere is enough demand in rural areas. If the supply is reliable and good, people are willing to pay more,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aLocal jobs\u000a\u000aUttar Pradesh is the only state with a policy for mini-grids. It aims to power nearly 20 million households, about a tenth of its population. The state offers a 30% subsidy for these grids, which may also be powered by wind, biomass or water, and must guarantee at least eight hours of electricity to homes, and six hours for commercial needs.\u000a\u000aImportantly, the policy offers exit options when the areas have adequate grid supply: either the distribution company can receive energy from the mini-grids at an agreed tariff, or the project may be transferred to the distribution company.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s ministry for renewable energy released a national draft policy for mini- and micro-grids last June.\u000a\u000aIt aims to deploy at least 10,000 renewable energy projects in the next five years in \u201cunserved and underserved parts of the country\u201d, with an average capacity of 50 KW per project.\u000a\u000aThe ambitious targets come at a time when renewable energy is at a turning point in India, as generating electricity from renewables costs nearly the same as from conventional sources.\u000a\u000aCoal still provides the lion\u2019s share of energy, but as a signatory to the Paris Agreement on climate change, India is committed to ensuring at least 40% of its electricity will come from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030.\u000a\u000aA 10-year blueprint predicts 57% of India\u2019s electricity capacity will come from non-fossil sources by 2027. Solar energy is a particular focus and will contribute 100 gigawatts (GW) of the renewable energy capacity target of 175 GW by 2022.\u000a\u000a\u201cRenewable energy-based mini-grids will boost small businesses, create local jobs and build economies. This will improve living standards in villages,\u201d said Kumarankandath. \u201cThat in turn will ensure women\u2019s empowerment, better health and education. There cannot be a better development agenda for the country,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aIn Atrauli, OMC\u2019s mini-grid is just off the main road, next to the telecom tower it also helps to power. OMC has 280 customers in Atrauli, 60% of them commercial, Rao said.\u000a\u000aOne of OMC\u2019s first customers in the village was Anita, a widowed mother of two, who didn\u2019t have an electricity connection and used kerosene lamps for lighting in her shack.\u000a\u000aFrom one base package of a single light, Anita now has three lights, one each in her room, her son\u2019s room and the kitchen. \u201cEarlier, the children would have to go search for a light to study by. But now they study at home, and I can do housework even at night,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to add a fan next.\u201d Thomson Reuters Foundation

VTelangana is committed to taking steps to deal with climate change, said Jogu Ramanna, the State\u2019s Minister for Environment & Forests.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are already witnessing the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme weather events such as heat waves, intense rainfalls, droughts and hailstorms. We need to prepare our communities to face this challenge,\u201d the Minister said while addressing the closing ceremony of a two-day workshop on climate change for media here.\u000a\u000aHe said the state government had launched a pilot project in Mahbubnagar district for building capacity of agricultural households and making them climate-resilient.\u000a\u000aThe workshop on April 11-12 was organised by Centre for Media Studies (CMS), German Agency for International Cooperation and the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and hosted by the Environmental Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI), Hyderabad.\u000a\u000aIt was part of a series of four regional workshops. The next three will be held in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.\u000a\u000aAll development projects are being examined for climate-friendliness, said B Kalyan Chakravarthy, Director General of EPTRI and Special Secretary, Environment & Forests. He said the media can play a critical role in communicating the challenge of climate change to communities and also influence planners and policymakers. He urged media persons to keep environment and climate at the back of their mind while writing about policies, programmes and initiatives.\u000a\u000a\u201cInadequate or ill-informed coverage of climate change does not help in sensitising people, policymakers and politicians. Clear and authentic media coverage on climate change mitigation and adaptation can help motivate people and communities to act,\u201d said PN Vasanti, Director General, CMS.\u000a\u000aThe workshop included field visits to Jawaharnagar Solid Waste Management Centre and climate-resilient agriculture initiatives at ICRISAT.

VAt the last meeting of the Environmental Goods Agreement in Geneva, in December 2016, participants were unable to close their differences on trade liberalisation of environmental goods (EG). The WTO defines EG as a host of products that can help to achieve environmental and climate protection goals.\u000a\u000aThe EGA builds on a list of 54 environment-related products on which the negotiating countries are advocating to create a consensus seeking to reduce tariffs. In 2001 when discussions began the list of products was much larger.\u000a\u000aCountries originally involved in the discussions are Australia, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Singapore, and the US, and the EU. Israel, Turkey and Iceland are recent entrants. They represent 86 per cent of the annual global market in green products.\u000a\u000aIndia has so far opposed the EGA fearing the developed countries could use it as a new trade-restrictive measure, apart from the fact that it is reluctant to reduce tariff lines for identified goods. Another question that has remained unanswered is the identification of goods, as some of the identified ones can be used for both environmental and general (non-environmental) purposes. A good example is a pipe, which can be used as an input for a renewable energy plant or a waste water treatment plant but can also be used to transport oil.\u000a\u000aIndia needs EGA\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGreen growth has been part and parcel of India\u2019s economic and environmental policies. Ever since India announced its National Climate Change Policy in 2008, a slew of measures to reduce carbon emissions have been taken. India has implemented the National Solar Mission with the ambitious target of achieving 20 GW of solar energy by 2022, besides taking the initiative to anchor an international solar alliance of all solar-rich countries located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. India also declared a voluntary goal of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 2030 from the 2005 level, despite facing enormous development challenges.\u000a\u000aIt is also important for India to explore the possibility of participating in an EGA dialogue which would liberalise trade in EGs. This will help achieve a common global good which has social consequences, not confined to any specific geography.\u000a\u000aSome key reasons why India should participate in the EGA are as follows: At the outset, as the benefits arising out of such an agreement would be shared only by the signatories, if India wishes to join at a later stage, there will be a cost involved.\u000a\u000aThe EGA may facilitate greater import of EGs, technologies, and knowledge-sharing that developing countries could benefit from, but the export potential for India will depend largely on non-tariff barriers (NTBs) being addressed. India\u2019s concerns, therefore, that the developed countries may set up NTBs consequent to an agreement can only be resolved if it is a part of the discussions.\u000a\u000aThe second issue is India\u2019s concern about tariff reductions, which India believes has commercial appeal for developed countries. India also argues that the developed economies have lower tariffs on many of the identified goods and hence the concessions, if made, would be much higher for developing than developed economies, thereby denting its market. The same may not be completely true, given India has a trade deficit of $6 billion in EGs. If India does not reduce tariffs, its domestic consumers will be bereft of EGs which are affordable. Besides, tariff reduction can have benefits of forward linkages for developing countries as it can lead to investments in the relevant sectors. Should India be part of the discussions it can negotiate to introduce tariff lines over an agreed time-frame over multiple intervals. This will also help domestic firms prepare for competition and give them time to adapt.\u000a\u000aNo longer a baby\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThirdly, India cannot afford to undertake an \u2018infant industry\u2019 approach by protecting renewable and other related industries. Global exports of the identified EGs products as in 2015 stood at $492 billion, while India exported EGs worth just $3 billion. The import of EGs by India on the other hand was three times more, at $9 billion, exhibiting capability or capacity differences. This deficiency can be plugged by allowing investments in products that are causing a trade deficit in EGs for India. India faces a huge electricity demand as industries and communities grow and get connected to grids. Today, few indigenous companies would be able to develop the necessary in-house technologies and components for a finished environmental product. International alliances would be vital for creating strong regional and global EG supply chains.\u000a\u000aFourthly and undeniably, one of the key constraints has been the end-use of the identified goods, which may require introducing varied tariff lines depending upon its varied utility. One that is solely being used for environment purposes could receive greater tariff cuts as compared to multiple lines.\u000a\u000aLastly, it has been observed that the investments of the developing world in renewable energy have increased significantly. In 2015, global investment in clean energy touched a record high of $285.9 billion, exceeding the previous record of $278.5 billion achieved in 2011 (excluding large hydro-electric projects). It was also for the first time that investments in clean energy from the developing world were greater than those from developed countries.\u000a\u000aThe developing world (including China, India and Brazil) committed a total of $156 billion in 2015, a 19 per cent increase from 2014, while developed countries invested $130 billion, down 8 per cent. Investment in EGs, especially when India suffers from trade deficit, would help India manufacture locally with foreign investments under the Make in India initiative, and possibly even become a manufacturing hub for EG gradually.\u000a\u000aWay forward\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGiven India\u2019s ambitious clean energy targets, it will be wise to reconsider its participation in the EGA. India\u2019s presence can provide needed balance to the negotiations.\u000a\u000aAn alternative could be for India to explore the possibility of engaging with the existing members after formally consulting other developing economies. They can also devise a news of EGs. Developing countries such as Mexico, India, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, Argentina, Thailand and South Africa have combined EG exports of $25 billion, and a trade deficit of $37 billion in 2015.\u000a\u000aTariff liberalisation in EGs will help India integrate in global and regional value chains. EGA can boost EGs facilitating clean energy and energy efficiency technologies by lowering costs, and augmenting supply and usage. Opening up trade in EGs will help achieve the desired climate adaptation and mitigation goals of not only India, but also globally, by transitioning to a lower-carbon economy.\u000a\u000aIf we fail to act now, it is certain that changing climatic conditions will become catastrophic with irretrievable consequences for humanity in the years ahead.\u000a\u000aThe writer is an economist with the Export-Import Bank of India.

VIn a major boost for clean energy, the has signed an agreement for its 750 MW Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL) project, the International Corporation (IFC) said on Monday.\u000a\u000aThe project, which is expeccted to generate clean energy at a record low of Rs 3.30 per unit, will be functional by next year. The project will supply power to the Delhi Metro and Power Management Company.\u000a\u000aA World Bank constituent, IFC has termed this a major boost to India's 100 GW solar power goal by 2022.\u000a\u000a"With a record low tariff of US cents 4.4 per kilowatt hour offered through a competitive bidding process, the project achieved the lowest tariffs ever awarded for a solar project in India, bringing solar tariffs in the country on par with fossil fuels for the first time," IFC said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIFC is the lead transaction advisor for this project, that will mobilise $550 million in private investment and avoid a million tonnes of green house gas emissions.\u000a\u000a"The Rewa solar park transaction will have an enormous ripple effect, helping create new markets for large solar projects across India and the region," said Philippe Le Houerou, IFC Executive Vice President and CEO.\u000a\u000aHe added that the agreement signed by India in the past and including Rewa park, are the next step in IFC's efforts to help India be a global leader in renewable energy and secure a clean, sustainable future.\u000a\u000aIFC advised in designing the structure, balancing public and market risks, and creating a competitive auction process for RUMSL.\u000a\u000aRUMSL is a joint venture between the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (MPUVN).\u000a\u000aThe Rewa solar power project will also receive financing from the World Bank with more than $1 billion in lending over financial year 2017, as well as supporting the India-led International Solar Alliance, which aims to promote solar use globally by mobilising $1 trillion in investments by 2030.\u000a\u000a"We are very proud that Madhya Pradesh is leading the way in large-scale renewable power developments in India," said Manu Srivastava, Chairman of RUMSL and Principal Secretary, New and Renewable Energy Department of the Madhya Pradesh\u000a\u000aSrivastava added that for the first time in the country, the solar power has achieved grid parity, which means that the ambitious renewable energy targets set by the Indian are within reach.\u000a\u000aThe project was auctioned in three packages of 250 MW each, and will be one of the biggest single site solar projects in the world. The three winning bidders for the project are Mahindra Renewables, ACME Solar, and Solenergie Power.\u000a\u000a"India is IFC's top country exposure, globally.

VMumbai/New Delhi: Some of the world\u2019s biggest pension funds, seeking long-term returns on green investments, are scouting for deals in India\u2019s solar power sector, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is targeting $100 billion in investment in the next five years.\u000a\u000aPower demand in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy is set to surge as the economy grows and more people move into the cities. India estimates peak electricity demand will more than quadruple in the next two decades to 690 gigawatt (GW), which would require rapid growth in generation and transmission capacity.\u000a\u000aThat potential, helped by cheaper solar material costs and government efforts to curb pollution, is drawing global investors, including Canada\u2019s top pension fund managers\u2014Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec (CDPQ), and Ontario Teacher\u2019s Pension Plan (OTPP).\u000a\u000aInvestors\u2019 focus is primarily on solar power generation, funding large-scale solar parks.\u000a\u000aCDPQ, which has C$270.7 billion ($199 billion) in net assets, says it plans to invest in India\u2019s solar sector with Azure Power, a New York-listed firm with about 1 GW of solar capacity under various stages of development.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe plan to do more with them. Our approach is really to pick the right partner and then build a platform that can be sustained over several years,\u201d said Anita George, CDPQ\u2019s South Asia head, adding she wouldn\u2019t rule out investing in other solar ventures in future.\u000a\u000aOther international investors have already entered India\u2019s renewable energy sector, such as Dutch fund manager APG, Canada\u2019s Brookfield Asset Management, the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, and European utilities EDF, Engie and Enel.\u000a\u000aAPG Asset Management, which last year agreed to jointly invest $132 million with India\u2019s Piramal Enterprises into solar power, is looking for more deals.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe expect to be able to announce another investment in the Indian renewable energy sector in the coming months,\u201d said Hans-Martin Aerts, APG\u2019s infrastructure head for Asia Pacific.\u000a\u000aAlok Verma, an executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, which has advised companies on renewable deals, said he expects at least 5 GW of solar power to be added from next year, most of it supported by overseas funds.\u000a\u000aAiming high\u000a\u000aSolar power generation capacity in India has more than tripled in less than three years to over 12 GW, helped by lower module prices and borrowing costs, and a government drive - but that is still only around 4% of total power capacity of about 315 GW.\u000a\u000aChina, the world\u2019s biggest solar producer, more than doubled its capacity last year, to 77.42 GW.\u000a\u000aSuyi Kim, Asia Pacific head at CPPIB, Canada\u2019s largest pension manager, said solar appears more attractive in India than wind power. \u201cIn India, my impression is that solar seems to be more attractive. But it\u2019s case by case,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aIndia typically logs more than 300 days of sunshine a year.\u000a\u000aKim declined to comment on any specific investment plans, but two people with knowledge of developments said CPPIB was scouting for deals.\u000a\u000aFunding and M&A in India\u2019s solar sector amounted to around $1.6 billion in January-March, says research firm Mercom.\u000a\u000aWhile deal sizes have been relatively small, some companies such as Japan\u2019s SoftBank, along with partners, have pledged to invest $20 billion in Indian solar power generation projects.\u000a\u000aSoftBank said the timeline for investments would depend on state and central governments. \u201cWe remain committed to building a GW-scale portfolio of solar projects in India,\u201d said Raman Nanda, CEO of SB Energy, a joint venture of SoftBank, Foxconn Technology Group and Bharti Enterprises. \u201cWe will do this through strategic partnerships.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot all sunshine\u000a\u000aNone of this comes without risk, of course.\u000a\u000aInvestors could face payment delays from India\u2019s heavily-indebted power distribution firms, and some experts note that the bidding for projects in government auctions is too aggressive, with per unit prices slumping more than 70% since 2010.\u000a\u000a\u201cGetting returns on investments ... and getting paid by distribution companies are the major risks being assessed by foreign investors,\u201d said Sumant Sinha, CEO at ReNew Power, a renewable energy firm backed by Goldman.\u000a\u000aIntermittency - power is only produced under bright sunlight - is another issue, as there are additional costs for using inverters or diesel generators to use solar power at night.\u000a\u000a\u201cBased on current market conditions and policies, I see a path to 65-70 GW (solar capacity) by 2022, but not more,\u201d said Mercom CEO Raj Prabhu.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s still some way short of the government pledge for 100 GW by 2022.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo reach 100 GW by 2022, distribution company finances need to improve drastically, power demand has to increase quickly, and transmission infrastructure needs to keep up,\u201d Prabhu said.

VPresident Donald Trump celebrated 100 days in office Saturday with a campaign-type speech that will be parsed around world capitals for the attack on the Paris Climate Accord, which he said was one-sided, and for accusing India, Russia and China of not paying enough towards mitigation of greenhouses gases.\u000a\u000aAlso of interest to the world outside of the United States, specially to the government, businesses and people in India, was his reaffirmation of commitment to protectionism, listing for his supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania his \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order among the achievements of his term.\u000a\u000aOn the climate change accord the president said, \u201cOur government rushed to join international agreement where the United States bears the costs and bears the burden while other countries get the benefit and pay nothing and this includes deals like the one-sided Paris Climate Accord. where the United States pays billions while China, Russia and India have contributed, and will contribute, nothing.\u2019\u000a\u000aAs the crowd booed, he asked them if the accord reminded them of the Iran deal \u2014 \u201cthat beauty\u201d \u2014 an agreement driven by President Barack Obama to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons programme that has been widely greeted by much suspicion and derision among conservatives.\u000a\u000aHe went on to say that he will be making a \u201cbig decision on the Paris Accord over the next two weeks and \u2026 we will see what happens\u201d and said the accord fit a pattern of \u201cglobal theft and plunder of American wealth at the expense of the American worker\u201d.\u000a\u000aTrump argued, citing an estimate, that full compliance with the accord will shrink American Gross Domestic Product by $2.5 trillion over 10 years \u201cthat means factories and plants closing all over our country \u2026 (but) not with me, folks\u201d.\u000a\u000aAnd that was the theme of his pitch on jobs. \u201cWe are ending the offshoring and bringing back our beautiful, wonderful and great American jobs,\u201d Trump added, continuing on that theme. His administration has launched a series of steps recently aimed at preventing loss of American jobs in the IT sector.\u000a\u000aWith the same overarching goal of protecting local jobs, Trump signed last week an executive order that seeks a review of the H-1B temporary visa programme for high-skilled foreign workers that are used heavily by Indian IT firms, which were directly and unequivocally accused by senior White House officials of gaming the system.\u000a\u000aTrump skipped the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner in DC, as he had announced earlier, to address a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a state hit by loss of manufacturing jobs, to talk about his achievements in 100 days in office. The first 10 minutes of his 58-minute speech were devoted to eviscerating news media outlets \u2014 CNN, MSNBC and the New York Times, using many of his old attack lines.

VSeattle: Thousands of people across the US marched on President Donald Trump's 100th day in office to demand action on climate change.\u000a\u000aAt the marquee event yesterday, the Peoples Climate March in Washington, DC, tens of thousands of demonstrators made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.\u000a\u000aOrganisers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city's federal plaza to Trump Tower.\u000a\u000a"We are here because there is no Planet B," the Rev Mariama White-Hammond of Bethel AME Church told the crowd in Boston.\u000a\u000aParticipants said they're objecting to Trump's rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.\u000a\u000aTrump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame. More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe.\u000a\u000a"I've seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them," said lobsterman Richard Nelson, of Friendship, Maine.\u000a\u000aPeople in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood. Saharlah Farah, a 16- year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalised groups that have less financial resources.\u000a\u000a"But I see untapped power here today," she said.\u000a\u000aA demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city.\u000a\u000aPeople gathered on Boston Common carried signs with slogans such as "Dump Trump." Handmade signs at Seattle's march included the general "Love Life" and the specific "Don't Kill Otters."\u000a\u000aSome of the marches drew big-name attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the nation's capital and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at a Montpelier event.\u000a\u000a"Honoured to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice," DiCaprio tweeted.

VMaharashtra lost 58.81 square kilometres (14,532 acres) of green cover in the seven years from 2005-06 to 2011-12, a first-of-its-kind satellite mapping of the state has revealed. This is an area equivalent to about 660 Oval Maidans. The iconic maidan covers 22 acres south of Churchgate.\u000a\u000aThe Maharashtra Forest Cover Change study was conducted by the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Applications Centre (MRSAC), Nagpur, and published by the state\u2019s forest department in Nagpur on April 22. MRSAC compared satellite images of Maharashtra from 2005-06 with those from 2011-12 to arrive at the figure. The report said the state\u2019s green cover \u2013 including various types of forests, plantations, mangroves, swamps and other tree-covered areas \u2013 fell from 56,705 sq km to 56,646 sq km over that seven-year period.\u000a\u000aPravin Srivastava, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) for information technology and policy, state forest department, issued a caveat, saying, \u201cThis report relied purely on technology and needs to be corroborated with on-ground studies. This will form the second part of the study and will begin soon. Forest officials will be asked to submit reports about the forest cover in their districts.\u201d\u000a\u000aSrivastava said there were three main reasons for the decrease in forest cover. \u201cDevelopment projects sanctioned in forests have led to deforestation. Long dry spells during the monsoon also affected the cover as forests are rain-fed,\u201d he said. \u201cForest fires caused by excessive heat are another reason.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the area covered by evergreen or semi-evergreen, dense forests fell from 5,426.5 sq km in 2005-06 to 5388.5 sq km in 2011-12, evergreen open forests increased in size from 1378.7 sq km in 2005-06 to 1415.4 sq km in 2011-12. The area covered by deciduous dense forests fell by 922.55 sq km, while 187.47 sq km of deciduous open forest was lost, the report\u2019s summary stated.\u000a\u000aThis is the first time the forest department has used technology to track changes in forest cover, which is a global mandate. Until now, only Telangana\u2019s forest department had used satellite mapping to track its green cover. To reduce carbon emissions by increasing green cover in developing countries, the United Nations introduced a collaborative programme called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REBB+) in 2008. Under the REBB+ convention, any agency that able to increase green cover will be reimbursed for it efforts by developed nations.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith 2.81 crore trees planted in 2016, four crore planned in 2017, and a 50-crore target for 2019, five years from now we will have a strong case to claim reimbursement for our efforts. We now have the technology to prove any increase in green cover over the next five years,\u201d said Srivastava. Speaking about why such studies were not done earlier, he said, \u201cSuch technology was not readily available a decade ago.\u201d

Vand China, part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, have favoured greater transparency in climate negotiations in Germany's Bonn next week as these are crucial ahead of the Paris climate change agreement COP23, climate negotiators said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe countries called for the 46th session on Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 46) to take up the matter of transparency and conflict of interest in its discussions while making a strong proposal to tackle the menace.\u000a\u000aCiting a Corporate Accountability International report released in on Tuesday, an Indian negotiator said there are close to 250 groups, organisations, associations and trade bodies that have access to influence and hamper the climate negotiation process.\u000a\u000aMost of these groups are funded by the same industries responsible for climate change, he contended.\u000a\u000aThe Corporate Accountability International report investigated six of the many fossil fuel- funded lobbies that are being allowed to "undermine" the climate negotiations process at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000aIt names the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Association, the Business Roundtable, FuelsEurope, the Business Council of Australia and the International Chamber of Commerce, as six industry associations that have been found to have stymieing climate action.\u000a\u000aAn official associated with the Indian negotiation team told IANS last year a similar call was made by countries representing nearly 70 percent of the world population. However, it was met with intense opposition from the European Union, Australia as well as the US.\u000a\u000aThis year, with the whispers of a possible backtracking by the US on the commitments it made in the Paris agreement, the call for identifying groups funded by fossil fuel industry and impeding climate action is growing even stronger, he said.\u000a\u000a"Right now hundreds of business trade associations have access to the climate talks, and many of them are funded by some of the world's biggest polluters and climate change deniers," said Corporate Accountability International's International Policy Director Tamar Lawrence-Samuel.\u000a\u000a"With so many arsonists in the fire department, it's no wonder we've failed to put the fire out."\u000a\u000aTo limit the reach of such groups, the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, in its submission for the Bonn negotiations, suggested an example of WHO Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors, which not only provides for participation of non-state actors but also of protecting against "conflict of interest", "reputational risk" as well as "undue influence".\u000a\u000aThe group proposes that UNFCCC develops a legal framework for non-state actors and non-party stakeholders in climate negotiation process related to implementation of the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aClimate negotiators are gathering in Bonn May 8-18 to develop a "rulebook" in order to translate the Paris Agreement into action against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump mulling a possible pullout of the landmark agreement.\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement aims to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by cutting greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000avg/vd\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VPresident Donald Trump has been asked by 11 American governors not to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate deal, warning that and will reap the benefits of low-carbon leadership if America does not make the transition to clean energy.\u000a\u000aThe 11 governors - including those from California, New York, Oregon, Washington, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, Hawaii, Delaware and Rhode Island - wrote a letter in this regard to Trump yesterday, days after he said that he is going to take a "big decision" on Paris Climate Change Agreement.\u000a\u000aTrump has been highly critical of the Paris Agreement, arguing that the US has been unfairly treated by the international agreement and that countries like and have benefited from this.\u000a\u000a"Collective action to limit emissions world-wide is critical; without collaboration, climate change will cost the world's nations several trillion dollars in damages. Under the Paris Agreement, all the world's major economies are taking action on climate change for the first time, including and India, which have put forward their own commitments to cut their carbon pollution domestically," the letter said.\u000a\u000a"If the US does not maintain global climate leadership through national policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy, China and will. This would be a huge lost opportunity, putting us at a competitive disadvantage and potentially locking us into technologies and economic pathways that are increasingly obsolete while China and India reap the benefits of low-carbon leadership," the governors said.\u000a\u000aObserving that Americans demand the low-cost, clean-air benefits that a clean energy transition can provide, the letter said the leading US companies recognise the need to address business risks and opportunities through the Paris Agreement, and are wisely investing in low-carbon fuels and technologies to stay on the cutting edge of the global economy.\u000a\u000a"Our track record-reducing carbon pollution while growing jobs and our economies-provides proof that we need not sacrifice opportunity for action. Indeed, we can secure that opportunity only by continuing to lead," they wrote.\u000a\u000aThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gases emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020.\u000a\u000aThe agreement was adopted by consensus on December 12, 2015.\u000a\u000aIndia, the world's fourth-largest carbon emitter with its population of 1.3 billion people, ratified the Paris agreement on climate change to become the 62nd nation to join the deal last year.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VWe stand today on the brink of a long-term anthropogenic and ecological change, caused not by the forces of nature but our own exploitation of the planet\u2019s resources. There is compelling evidence that climate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen, and there is a large chance of a global average temperature rise exceeding 2C by the end of this century. It has also been established in various scientific studies that any such warming of the planet will lead to increased natural calamities such as floods and cyclones, declined crop yields and ecological degradation. A large increase in global temperatures correlates with an average 5% loss in global GDP, with poor countries suffering costs in excess of 10% of GDP.\u000a\u000aAs a mitigation policy\u000a\u000aA global and immediate policy response is urgently required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. We want to reinvigorate the discourse towards adopting a multilaterally coordinated imposition of a carbon tax as a potent mitigation policy. A carbon tax aims to internalise the externality of climate change by setting a price on the carbon content of energy consumed or greenhouse gas emitted in the production or consumption of goods. Carbon tax regimes will only be effective if harmonised internationally. Different country-wise policies could lead to \u2018carbon leakages\u2019 where energy-intensive businesses will most likely move to less strict national regimes.\u000a\u000aHarmonised carbon taxes hold advantages over quantitative limits imposed through government control and regulation. First, a carbon tax regime avoids the problems related to choosing a baseline. In a price approach, the natural baseline is a zero carbon tax. Second, a carbon tax policy will be better able to adapt to the element of uncertainty which pervades the science of climate change. Quantity limits on emissions are related to the stocks of greenhouse gas emissions, while the price limits are related to the flow of emissions. From this uncertainty arises another complication of price volatility which is the third reason why a carbon tax policy is likely to cause less volatility in the prices of carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aFourth, quantity limiting policies are often accompanied by administrative arbitrariness and corruption through rent-seeking. This sends off negative signals to investors. In a price-based carbon tax, the investor has an assured long-term regulation to adapt to and can weigh in the costs involved.\u000a\u000aAddresses issue of equity\u000a\u000aFifth, the most contentious issue in any international negotiation on climate change mitigation either at the level of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has been the issue of equity between high-income and low-income countries. The price-based approach in the form of carbon taxes makes it easier to implement such equity-based international adjustments than the quantity-based approach. Finally, the carbon tax will essentially be a Pigovian Tax which balances the marginal social costs and benefits of additional emissions, thereby internalising the costs of environmental damage. It can act as an incentive for consumers and producers to shift to more energy-efficient sources and products.\u000a\u000aSome countries and regions such as the U.S. and the European Union already have fairly successful carbon pricing regimes in place in the form of carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes. Some other countries have introduced general taxes on energy consumption instead of direct taxes on carbon content. This can be a good starting point for a shift in policy by countries while they deliberate on a harmonised carbon tax regime. The political consensus in favour of a direct carbon tax will be difficult to achieve in low- and middle-income countries that have developmental priorities and lack the capacity to administer such regimes. A general tax on energy consumption combined with a technology-centric policy that promotes entrepreneurs and investors who develop low-energy intensive products can be a good starting point from where they can gradually move towards a direct carbon tax. Another near-term approach can be a \u2018cap-and-tax\u2019 which combines the strengths of both quantity and price approaches. Cap-and-tax might also address the concerns of environmentalists that a price-based approach does not impose hard constraints on emissions.\u000a\u000aAfrica as a priority region\u000a\u000aWe conclude with a few areas of further deliberation to move forward on an effective harmonised carbon tax regime. Countries must negotiate and share policy experiences and researches in this area. They also must decide upon the appropriate forum to discuss and implement any such mitigation policy. The WTO could be the preferred forum, given the important nexus between international trade and climate change. Finally, any prospective policy regime must give the highest importance to the African continent. A rapidly growing African economy must then be able to learn from past lessons without having to choose between economic growth and climate change mitigation.\u000a\u000aA carbon tax policy might not seem a magic wand, but it is also less likely to face political opposition and compromise while creating new sectors for businesses and growth.\u000a\u000aArmin Rosencranz is a professor of law at Jindal Global Law School, Sonipat.

VChina and India have surpassed the United States to become the two most attractive countries for renewable energy investment, a report by UK accountancy firm Ernst & Young showed on Tuesday. In an annual ranking of the top 40 renewable energy markets worldwide in terms of allure, China was the top country, followed by India.\u000a\u000aThe United States, which ranked the highest last year, slumped to third place, due to a shift in U.S. energy policy under President Donald Trump. Trump has issued orders to roll back many of the previous administration\u2019s climate change policies, revive the U.S. coal industry and review the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to cut carbon emissions from power plants.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, China announced this year that it would spend $363 billion on developing renewable power capacity by 2020. India\u2019s government has unveiled plans to build 175 gigawatts of renewable energy generation by 2022. Among European countries, Germany ranked fourth, France eighth and Britain moved to 10th place, from 14th last year.\u000a\u000aWhile Britain\u2019s renewable investment environment is more settled than in recent years, which were beset by subsidy cuts, future energy policy after it leaves the European Union is uncertain, the report said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s reappearance in the top 10 is the result of other countries falling away \u2013 notably Brazil, which cancelled a wind and solar auction in December \u2013 rather than any particularly encouraging resurgence,\u201d said Ben Warren, EY\u2019s head of energy corporate\u000a\u000afinance.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VA senior Indian official has been appointed as the deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which the landmark Paris agreement was negotiated and adopted. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aA senior Indian official has been appointed as the deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), under which the landmark Paris agreement was negotiated and adopted. Ovais Sarmad, 57, was appointed to the post at the assistant secretary-general level by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Stephane Djuarric, the spokesperson for Guterres. The appointment has been made after consultation with the Conference of Parties through its Bureau.\u000a\u000aSarmad will succeed Richard Kinley of Canada. His appointment comes at a crucial time when most of the countries have ratified the Paris Climate Agreement and the US President, Donald Trump, has threatened to scrap the pact.\u000a\u000aSarmad holds a Bachelor of Commerce from Hyderabad\u2019s Osmania University, and professional certification in management accountancy from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in London. Sarmad currently serves as chief of staff to the director general of the International Organisation for Migration.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe brings to the position nearly 27 years of experience with IOM, where he worked in several policy and management areas to strengthen the organisation\u2019s operational effectiveness in close consultation with IOM member-states. \u201cHe was instrumental in the establishment of the organisation\u2019s Ethics and Conduct Office and was a key team member negotiating the agreement which brought the IOM into the United Nations System,\u201d said Djuarric.\u000a\u000aSarmad joined IOM in 1990, in Geneva, where he served notably as chief of budget, director of resource management, director of the Global Administrative Centre and chief of Mission to the Philippines.

VToo hot to handle: Urban jungles of skyscrapers and concrete roads contribute to a warmer world. | Photo Credit: VICTOR ROMERO\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aUnder a dual onslaught of global warming and localised, urban heating, some of the world\u2019s cities may be as much as eight degrees Celsius warmer by 2100, researchers have warned.\u000a\u000aSuch a temperature spike can have dire consequences for the health of city-dwellers, robbing companies and industries of able workers, and putting pressure on already strained natural resources such as water.\u000a\u000aThe projection is based on the worst-case-scenario assumption that emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases continue to rise throughout the 21st century. For the latest study, researchers used data from the world\u2019s 1,692 largest cities for the period 1950 to 2015.\u000a\u000aThe top quarter of most populated cities, in this scenario, could see the mercury rise 7 degrees Celsius or more by century\u2019s end, said a study in the journal Nature Climate Change.\u000a\u000aFor some, nearly 5 degrees Celsius of the total would be attributed to average global warming.\u000a\u000aThe rest would be due to the so-called urban heat island (UHI) effect, which occurs when cooling parks, dams and lakes are replaced by heat-conducting concrete and asphalt \u2014 making cities warmer than their surrounds, the researcher said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe top 5% (of cities per population) could see increases in temperatures of about 8 degree Celsius and larger,\u201d said study co-author Francisco Estrada of the Institute for Environmental Studies in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aMr. Estrada and a team used different projections of average planetary warming, combined with the UHI effect and potential harms, to estimate the future costs of warming on cities.\u000a\u000aThe median city, right in the middle of the range, stands to lose between 1.4% and 1.7% of GDP per year by 2050 and between 2.3% and 5.6% by 2100, they concluded. \u201cFor the worst-off city, losses could reach up to 10.9% of GDP by 2100,\u201d wrote the team.\u000a\u000aUHI \u201csignificantly\u201d increases city temperatures and economic losses from global warming, they added.\u000a\u000aThis meant that local actions to reduce UHI \u2014 such as planting more trees or cooling roofs and pavements, can make a big difference in limiting warming and minimising costs.\u000a\u000aCities cover only about 1% of the earth\u2019s surface but produce about 80% of gross world product and account for around 78% of energy consumed worldwide, said the researchers.\u000a\u000aThey produce more than 60% of global carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas for fuel.

VMUMBAI: New research shows how reducing carbon emissions can prevent billions of people from being exposed to unheard-of changes in climate in the coming decades.The study, published in Nature Climate Change, emphasises the human dimension of how unusual a warmer climate would appear to people living in different regions.The research identifies a new climate as 'unfamiliar' or 'unknown' if it would have occured once every few hundred years or more, on an average."Overall, we found new climates emerge faster in inhabited areas, especially in the tropics, than in the world as a whole," explains lead author Professor Dave Frame from Victoria University of Wellington."People living in tropical regions, such as the South East Asian nations and the Pacific Islands , are almost certain to experience 'unfamiliar' or even 'unknown' climates by the end of this century if climate change is not slowed down. The situation is almost as stark for many tropical African countries too."The emerging effects of climate change in the coming decades can be dramatically reduced with mitigation efforts, says co-author Dr Manoj Joshi of the University of East Anglia "Unknown climates might be expected before 2050 in many tropical areas, and before the end of the century in mid-latitude areas.""However, many people alive today could reap the benefits of slowing or stopping climate change. Projections of twenty-first century climate made with significantly reduced carbon emissions show that tropical climates, especially those areas with very high populations, can avoid such emergence, staying far more 'familiar' to the people who live there."Avoiding the emergence of unfamiliar or unknown climates helps societies to better adapt to climate change, adds co-author Dr Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading."Some amount of warming is inevitable. However, keeping climate within some bounds of familiarity mean that people can adapt more easily to whatever change does arrive."The paper, Population-based emergence of unfamiliar climates, was also co-authored by Luke Harrington and Dr Mairead de Roiste from Victoria University of Wellington.

VThe study, by Greenpeace India, says that while the country has made good progress in reaching its 60 GW utility scale solar electricity targets, deployment is particularly slow in the residential rooftops sector. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aIndia might be playing a leadership role in bringing the world together for the International Solar Alliance, but it is struggling with the adoption of solar rooftops in its metro cities, a recent study has shown. Despite friendly policies and net metering guidelines in several states and a subsidy of 30 per cent offered by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the installation of solar rooftop systems has been dismal in leading metros in the country, especially in Chennai and Mumbai, according to the study.\u000a\u000aAccording to the study, titled Indian Cities Slacking on Rooftop Solar, Delhi, which offers metered connections and a generation-based subsidy in its solar policy, has also failed to shine. The study, by Greenpeace India, says that while the country has made good progress in reaching its 60 GW utility scale solar electricity targets, deployment is particularly slow in the residential rooftops sector. The government has earmarked 40 GW as the rooftop solar target by 2022, but as of December 2016, only over 1 GW worth of installations have taken place.\u000a\u000aDelhi, which has a current estimated solar potential of 1.25 GW in buildings and has an official target of installing 1 GW by 2020 and 2 GW by 2025, has installed only 35.9 MW of solar rooftop capacity. Out of this, only 3 MW is from residential installations. Mumbai has also been slow in installing solar rooftops in residential buildings. Out of 1.72 GW estimated solar potential, as calculated by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, the city has installed only 5 MW of residential solar. Tamil Nadu, which offers Rs 20,000 subsidy for domestic consumers under the Chief Minister\u2019s Solar Rooftop Capital Incentive Scheme, has also not been able to make significant progress. The state has a rooftop solar target of 350 MW but not even 2 MW have been installed.\u000a\u000aYou may also like to watch:\u000a\u000a\u201cDespite the national incentive in the form of a 30 per cent capital subsidy, and a range of state incentives and schemes, rooftop solar is yet to take off in the same manner as large-scale solar. However, this does not mean India should lower its ambitious targets, as some have suggested. Rather, the government must step up and play a more proactive role in encouraging rooftop installations,\u201d said Pujarini Sen, Climate and Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace India.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs the convenor and a founding member of the International Solar Alliance, and a country with abundant solar potential, India\u2019s commitment to clean energy must continue to be robust.\u201d\u000a\u000aA Greenpeace poll showed significant public interest in adopting solar power. Close to 55 per cent of the 812 participants expressed willingness to invest and install solar. Despite this interest, awareness and various incentive schemes, the thrust on solar rooftops has largely been in the government, institutional and commercial buildings as opposed to homes.\u000a\u000aThe report cites lack of familiarity with the process and fear of bureaucratic red tape as the main reasons for the slow uptake of solar rooftops in the residential sector. Other reasons are insufficient knowledge among citizens about the financial incentives and attractive return-on-investment, perception that large upfront capital investment is required, and ineffective implementation of net metering in various states. \u201cIf central and state governments are serious about boosting solar, they must do a better job of reaching out to resident welfare associations and community groups to encourage people to shed their inhibitions and embrace rooftop solar,\u201d said Sen.\u000a\u000aHowever, the challenges on the ground are more complex. Developers stress that there is a problem of lack of uniform roofs in the country and the fact that roofs are often used for various purposes that doesn\u2019t leave enough space to install big panels. A 10 KW solar plant that can power three air-conditioners and is sufficient for a three-bedroom apartment needs around 1,000 sq. ft. of terrace area.\u000a\u000aVed Prakash Goyal, an advisor to Applied Solar Power Management, part of the ENGIE group, the largest utility company in the world, said: \u201cIn India, everyone puts the water tank on the south side of the roof and it is the direction where you get maximum solar energy. Plus, you have various things on roofs which reduces the available area needed for solar.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe government has also announced putting 18 per cent tax on solar panels under the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, though this number may be revised. While industry feels the currently proposed tax rate will increase cost of solar projects by 12 per cent, Goyal says that this will not be an impediment as far as solar rooftops are concerned.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe prices of solar modules are going down and it is expected that they might further decrease by roughly five per cent in the next six months, so may be the net effect of GST would be one per cent. In any case solar energy is becoming cheaper to install and the time is ripe for the government to do the needful to boost it further. With the right steps, I can foresee a boom in residential solar rooftops in the next two years.\u201d India, where there is an issue of both land availability and air pollution, is also a country with over 300 million buildings and as many rooftops.

VPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said he would withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry.\u000a\u000aTrump, tapping into the \u201cAmerica First\u201d message he used when he was elected president last year, said the Paris accord would undermine the US economy, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.\u000a\u000aNo one can laugh at us now: Trump\u000a\u000a\u201cWe're getting out,\u201d Trump said at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden under sunny skies on a warm June day, fulfilling a major election campaign pledge.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won't be,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance,\u201d Trump added.\u000a\u000aRepublican US congressional leaders backed Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded Trump \u201cfor dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs.\u201d\u000a\u000aSupporters of the accord, including some leading US business figures, called Trump's move a blow to international efforts to tackle dangers for the planet posed by global warming.\u000a\u000aObama expresses regret\u000a\u000aFormer Democratic President Barack Obama expressed regret over the pullout from a deal he was instrumental in brokering.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got," Obama added.\u000a\u000aTrump, who has called climate change a hoax, said his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement \u201con terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.\u201d He complained in particular about China's terms under the agreement.\u000a\u000aInternational leaders reacted with disappointment, even anger.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe decision made by U.S. President Trump amounts to turning their backs on the wisdom of humanity. I'm very disappointed... I am angry,\u201d Japanese Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto told a news conference on Friday in an unusually frank tone.\u000a\u000aEurope, Asia vow to defend pact\u000a\u000aGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a rare joint statement the agreement could not be renegotiated and urged their allies to hasten efforts to combat climate change and adapt.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the U.S. decision is disheartening, we remain inspired by the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies,\u201d said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\u000a\u000aA summit between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top European Union officials in Brussels on Friday will end with a joint statement - the first ever issued by China and the EU - committing both sides to full implementation of the Paris accord.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Berlin a day earlier, Premier Li said China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, would stick to its commitment to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aRussia also voiced abiding support for the Paris accord, regardless of the U.S. withdrawal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe made the decision to join, and I don't think we will (change) it,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.\u000a\u000aIn India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies and a growing contributor to pollution, a top advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi vouched for intentions to switch to renewable power generation independent of the Paris accord.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe prime minister is very keen on this,\u201d Arvind Panagariya said.\u000a\u000aUS Inc say decision a setback\u000a\u000aWith Trump's action, the United States will walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the pressing global issues of the 21st century. Syria and Nicaragua are the only other non-participants in the accord, signed by 195 nations in Paris in 2015.\u000a\u000aFiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who is the incoming head of the U.N. Climate Change Conferences, which formalised the 2015 pact, said Trump's decision was \u201cdeeply disappointing".\u000a\u000aFiji, like many other small island nations, is seen as particularly vulnerable to global warming and a possible rise in ocean levels as a result of melting polar ice.\u000a\u000aUS. business leaders voiced exasperation with the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein wrote on Twitter.\u000a\u000aTesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils after Trump's move.\u000a\u000aUnder the Paris accord, which took years to reach, rich and poor countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels that are blamed by scientists for warming the planet.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aPittsburgh's mayor, Democrat Bill Peduto, shot back on Twitter that his city, long the heart of the U.S. steel industry, actually embraced the Paris accord.\u000a\u000aThe spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the action a \u201cmajor disappointment.\u201d The UN body that handles climate negotiations said the accord could not be renegotiated based on the request of a single nation.\u000a\u000aAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking in Singapore on Friday, also called the U.S. decision "disappointing... but not at all surprising,\u201d adding that Australia remained \u201ccommitted to our Paris commitments.\u201d\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement \u201cit is regrettable that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will undermine international responsibility and efforts to respond to climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000a'Devastating harm'\u000a\u000aTrump said the United States would stop payments to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, in which rich countries committed billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with floods, droughts and other impacts from climate change.\u000a\u000aThe White House said it would stick to U.N. rules for withdrawing from the pact. Those rules require a nation to wait three years from the date the pact gained legal force, Nov. 4, 2016, before formally seeking to leave. That country must then wait another year.\u000a\u000aApple CEO Tim Cook expressed disappointment and said in an email to employees that he had spoken with Trump on Tuesday to try to persuade him to stay in the Paris accord. \u201cIt wasn't enough,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOther business leaders warned that the U.S. economy would give away technological leadership.\u000a\u000aGeneral Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said he was disappointed, adding: \u201cClimate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.\u201d\u000a\u000aDemocrats also blasted Trump. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision \u201cone of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States had committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. The United States accounts for more than 15 percent of total worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, second only to China.\u000a\u000aLeading climate scientists say greenhouse gas emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and have caused a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.\u000a\u000aA \u201cGlobal Trends\u201d report prepared by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence's office, released on Jan. 9, warned that climate change posed security risks because of extreme weather, stress on water and food, and global tensions over how to manage the changes.\u000a\u000aLast year was the warmest since records began in the 19th Century, as global average temperatures continued a rise dating back decades that scientists attribute to greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aFrank Rijsberman, Director-General of Seoul based Global Green Growth Institute expected international funding for investment needed to fight climate change would suffer, noting a $1 billion reduction in U.S. funding the Green Climate Fund in South Korea.\u000a\u000aEconomists said the U.S. withdrawal would potentially cost U.S. jobs. China and the EU both already employ more workers in the renewable energy sector than the United States, according to the data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).\u000a\u000a\u201cWinding back the climate agenda means that the U.S. will be left behind in the clean energy transition as other global players, such as in Europe and China, demonstrate greater commitment to deploying low carbon and job-creating solutions to climate change,\u201d said Peter Kiernan, of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

VEver since climate-skeptic Donald Trump won the US presidential elections, the international community has held its breath\u2014wondering whether Trump would fulfil his campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris Agreement, and if so, when and how. After months of dithering, and despite mounting international pressure, or perhaps as a peevish reaction to it, Trump returned from the G-7 meeting, where he was isolated on climate change, and promptly announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aMany factors contributed to this profoundly wrong-headed decision, not least, a disturbing lack of knowledge about the Paris Agreement. Trump\u2019s contention that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the US while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling, given the Agreement allows every country to choose its own \u201cnationally determined\u201d contribution (NDC), tailored to its national circumstances. And, it contains no obligations of result in relation to these NDCs. The Paris Agreement\u2019s facilitative approach is a sea change from the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s binding targets and timetables approach, yet Trump\u2019s remarks echoed the arguments the US had used 16 years ago to reject the Kyoto Protocol. Equally baffling is Trump\u2019s assertion that he would renegotiate a fair deal for the US. The Paris Agreement is remarkable for the extent to which it privileges sovereignty and national autonomy. The perceived \u201cunfairness\u201d Trump alludes to stems not from an internationally prescribed target\u2014the Paris Agreement contains none\u2014but a \u201cnationally determined\u201d contribution chosen by the previous US administration of its own volition.\u000a\u000aAnother factor at play is personality politics. Trump harbours, by all accounts, a disdain for international law, a dislike of being lectured by other world leaders, and a churlish desire to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. What better way to thumb a nose at Obama and the world, while playing to his dwindling fan base, than to withdraw from the hard won, painstakingly crafted and widely ratified Paris Agreement. That the US has yet again rejected a climate agreement that it played a central role in negotiating is unfortunate. But once the international community emerges from the understandable pall of gloom that this decision will cast, Trump\u2019s decision will be seen for what it is\u2014the deeply misguided act of a man on the wrong side of history, science, politics and the planet.\u000a\u000aThe exit of the US will doubtless leave a gaping hole in the international climate change regime. The world will suffer for it, in particular if the US remains outside long-term. The Paris Agreement, however, will endure, and may, with some hiccups, even stay on track to meeting its goals. The Paris Agreement, negotiated over several years in a truly multilateral process, is a finely balanced instrument that has near-universal buy-in. The Agreement will remain a bulwark against climate change, and continue to trigger the transition to clean energy and technological innovations needed to address climate change, while leaving the US and its corporations behind. Unlike in 2001, when the US withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, the US is no longer the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gases (GHG) emitter, and action is not restricted to developed countries. China and India, the world\u2019s largest and fourth largest GHG emitters, respectively, are cancelling plans to install new coal plants, reducing emissions faster than predicted, and are likely, by some accounts, to compensate for slower emissions reductions in the US. Also, unlike in 2001, climate action is not the preserve of states alone. There is a proliferation of actors, initiatives and networks across and within states. The business community, including multinational corporations, investors and insurance groups, are constructively engaged in climate action. Non-state and sub-national actors, not least US states like California and cities like New York, helped shape the Paris Agreement, and will continue to implement it. A portal created at the Paris conference to record the efforts of non-state actors contains 12,500 commitments from over 2,500 cities, 2,100 companies and 450 investors, many of them American. The momentum on climate action, as world leaders noted at the Marrakech climate conference, is \u201cirreversible\u201d.\u000a\u000aAny perceived leadership vacuum too will be quickly filled. The lingering threat of US withdrawal these past months has fostered unlikely alliances and a strong sense of solidarity among other nations. The BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries reiterated their \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to the Paris Agreement in April, as did the other G-7 countries last week. The EU and China have also committed to forging ahead to implement the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aIn some respects, the US withdrawal could even lead to a stronger Agreement over time. In advance of a decision on the Paris Agreement, Trump had begun the process of dismantling Obama-era domestic regulations to address US GHG emissions. The US would thus likely have fallen short of its NDC, and downgraded it. Such downgrading would have wreaked havoc with the normative foundations of an Agreement built on good faith expectations of \u201cprogression\u201d and \u201chighest possible ambition\u201d from states. It is also unclear how constructively (or otherwise) the US would have participated in the ongoing negotiations for the Paris \u201crule book\u201d. As it is, with the normative foundations of the Agreement secure from opportunistic manipulation by the Trump administration, the ongoing rule making processes can proceed unhindered. If and when the US decides to re-join the Paris Agreement, the international community will be waiting. Until then, Trump\u2019s narrow minded and self-serving agenda that ignores the needs of the planet and its inhabitants, will be trumped by strengthened multilateralism.\u000a\u000aLavanya Rajamani is professor at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi

VChristiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aThe Paris Climate Agreement is a historic treaty signed by over 190 nations and cannot be renegotiated on the request of a single nation, the United Nations\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change has said. The UNFCCC, under which the landmark Paris agreement was negotiated and adopted, said it \u201cregrets\u201d the announcement by US President Donald Trump that his government will withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\u000a\u000aTrump, making his announcement from the Rose Garden of the White House said his administration will begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or an entirely new pact \u201con terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso watch:\u000a\u000aThe UNFCCC Secretariat said it notes Trump\u2019s intention to renegotiate the modalities for the US participation in the agreement.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Paris Agreement remains a historic treaty signed by 194 and ratified by 147 counties. Therefore it cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single Party,\u201d UNFCCC said. It added that it stands ready to engage in dialogue with the United States government regarding the implications of the announcement.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Paris Agreement is aimed at reducing risk to economies and lives everywhere while building the foundation for a more prosperous, secure and sustainable world. It enjoys profound credibility, as it was forged by all nations and is supported by a growing wave of business, investors, cities, states, regions and citizens,\u201d the UN framework convention said, underscoring its commitment to \u201ccontinue working with all governments and partners in their efforts to fast forward climate action at global and national levels.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdopted in Paris by the 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at a conference known as COP21 in December 2015, the Agreement was signed at the world body\u2019s headquarters here in April 2016. The Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

VAround a fortnight ago, just when US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris climate pact, a veteran naturalist, sitting in the Kanha National Park, said, \u201cI have rarely seen the barasingha munch so much on leaves before!\u201d The barasingha, a rare swamp deer with magnificent branched antlers, is known to feed solely on grass, aquatic vegetation and a few shrubs.\u000a\u000aAccording to local naturalists, there is a change in the barasingha\u2019s feeding habits because its favoured grass is slowly disappearing. The grasslands of Kanha in Madhya Pradesh, with its famed deer and tiger population, were empty as we took a round of a meadow.\u000a\u000aOn 1 June, Trump announced that his country was pulling out of the historic Paris Agreement. The pact, agreed by 195 countries in December 2015, is aimed at countering the threat of climate change by keeping global mean temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aAcross the world, we can already see small changes all around us\u2014beyond the dramatic images of melting polar ice and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate change is as much local as it is global, and it\u2019s the smaller stories on how communities are being affected that often move people the most,\u201d says Bill McKibben, well-known American environmentalist and author of The End Of Nature.\u000a\u000aBut since climatology is complex, and the perceived threats or impact are not immediately visible, it\u2019s a topic which is difficult to communicate. However, there are many local stories in our own backyard. Here is a small example.\u000a\u000aI spent the last fortnight in the forests of central India\u2014in and around two famed national parks and tiger reserves, Pench and Kanha. In the 19th century, this forest landscape was celebrated in two iconic books\u2014Rudyard Kipling\u2019s Jungle Book (1894) and Captain James Forsyth\u2019s The Highlands Of Central India (1871).\u000a\u000aApart from rich biodiversity, the vast forests that Forsyth eulogized in his book, are also home to one of the oldest tribes of India\u2014the Gonds.\u000a\u000aThese forests exist today in fragmented patches. From 1880-2012, the average global temperature on earth increased by 0.8 degrees Celsius, according to US space agency Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. During the same period, India lost about 40% of its forest cover.\u000a\u000aThe Gonds of Pench hold the forest close to their hearts. Their principal deity, Bada Dev, the creator and protector, lives in the saj tree (Terminalia elliptica,or the crocodile bark tree), and their knowledge of the forest and its ways is second to none.\u000a\u000aAage jaisa jungle aur nai raha (the jungles are no longer what they used to be), I was told by the village elders in a Gond hamlet. In the past, it used to drizzle for days at a stretch, but now the rain comes down in short and heavy spells and the water drains away quickly, they said. Annual rainfall figures may not change but the number of rainy days is down and rainfall has become erratic. Due to this change, the soil is unable to absorb the rain and recharge the water table, resulting in drier forests. Scientists at the US\u2019 Stanford University have also corroborated the Gond observation in a study which predicts that extreme dry and wet spells will lead to more droughts and floods in central India.\u000a\u000aNature is a complex web. As moisture in the soil dries up, it affects the regeneration of the forest and its undergrowth\u2014grasses and shrubs. In Kanha and Pench, this has led to weed infestation and the rise of climate-resilient exotic species such as Parthenium hysterophorus, Hyptis suaveolens and Lantana camara, which have overpowered native species.\u000a\u000aFor example, Parthenium, which originates in central and south America, is known to cause widespread damage to grass and farm land and can lead to respiratory problems. Exotic species (species not native to a particular region) tend to be introduced either accidentally, through international trade, or for ornamental reasons.\u000a\u000aIn Kanha, at least two long-term scientific studies show that grasslands known for hosting diverse populations of herbivorous wildlife are shrinking even as the ranks of the herbivores increase.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of the grasslands (meadows) within the reserve have changed drastically, resulting in the preponderance of less palatable and fire-resistant grasses and decrease in cover of perennial fodder species. Several grassland patches have been taken over by alien invasive species,\u201d states a 2016 Wildlife Institute of India report.\u000a\u000aThe profusion of non-palatable grasses has forced herbivores to move out of grasslands and raid croplands in villages\u2014many of them tribal villages\u2014on the edges of forests. And as these herbivores move towards human habitation, predators\u2014especially the tiger\u2014follow in search of food. This in turn leads to increasing human-wildlife conflict, posing a huge challenge for the forest department to manage and protect species.\u000a\u000aClimate change affects forests immensely. Since the beginning of the 20th century, temperatures in India are said to have increased by more than 1.2 degrees Celsius. Add erratic rainfall to the mix, and it\u2019s a far from ideal scenario.\u000a\u000aWe often forget the invisible force of climate in our lives, the little changes that slowly alter our planet. Despite what climate change deniers like Trump may suggest, the connection and impact are impossible to miss.\u000a\u000aOut In The Wild is a column on the good, bad and ugly of nature conservation.

VNew Delhi: Solar power tariffs in India may decline further as a result of the US withdrawal from the Paris climate deal affected by President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAccording to several developers, manufacturers and analysts, Chinese manufacturers may further cut their solar module prices to drive sales in India because they may not have a significant US market left any longer. Modules account for nearly 60% of a solar power project\u2019s total cost and their prices fell by about 26% in 2016 alone.\u000a\u000aOf China\u2019s solar module manufacturing capacity, estimated to be around 70 gigawatts (GW) per year, the major markets are the US, India and China itself. With green energy activity expected to slow down in the US, and the Chinese solar power generation stimulus petering off, China\u2019s solar equipment makers may adopt a more competitive stance on pricing to drive demand.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn order to support demand, China stepped in and launched a major programme in 2014-15 due to which it added a record 35GW of capacity. This is expected to come down this year. There will be a huge capacity that Chinese manufacturers will have to deal with this year. It will further drive down prices with solar power tariffs in India expected to go below the Rs2 per unit mark,\u201d said the chief executive of a solar power firm which participated in the recent solar auction rounds in India.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn case of successful exit from the accord, we may see Chinese manufacturers play a major role in the global solar industry which may not be good for India\u2019s energy security,\u201d said Gyanesh Chaudhary, managing director and chief executive officer, Vikram Solar Pvt. Ltd.\u000a\u000aMost solar power developers in India have been sourcing solar modules and equipment from countries such as China where they are cheaper.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s installed solar power generation capacity has risen over fourfold to 12.2GW from 2.6GW as of 26 May 2014.\u000a\u000aHowever, some believe that there will not be an immediate impact.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody had predicted a tariff of Rs2.4 per unit six months back. But realistically speaking, Rs2.4 per unit is really challenging and for another one year I don\u2019t see much reduction in tariff. Also, because of GST (goods and services tax), overall the capex cost will increase and due to which there will be a 20-30 paise rise in price also,\u201d said Sunil Rathi, director, Waaree Energies Ltd, a solar module manufacturer. India recorded its lowest solar power tariff of Rs2.44 per unit in May.\u000a\u000a\u201cUS demand for solar is not expected to change significantly as key US states have declared openly to continue their support to renewable energy. However, reduction in Chinese module prices is expected to continue till the manufacturers are able to stretch their margins,\u201d said Kulamani Biswal, director, finance at NTPC Ltd, India\u2019s largest power generation utility. NTPC plans to be present across the green energy value chain and is evaluating a plan to set up a solar module facility.\u000a\u000aMajor Chinese solar module manufacturers include Jinko Solar, JA Solar Holdings, ET Solar, Hanwha Group, Chint Solar, GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd and Trina Solar Ltd.\u000a\u000aExperts say a more competitive solar module market will emerge for India following the US\u2019s changed stand on green energy. \u201cIndia\u2019s actions on renewable energy is independent of the US; it is market driven and private- sector led. In fact, it improves the scenario for India as availability of funds and technology increases, prices are expected to fall further,\u201d said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner, power and utilities at PwC India.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith a lower global demand of solar capacity, cheaper capital and equipment will flow to the Indian renewable energy sector,\u201d added Debasish Mishra, partner, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Llp.\u000a\u000aThis may further impact the domestic manufacturers who have approached the government over the dumping of Chinese modules.\u000a\u000aQueries emailed to Jinko Solar, JA Solar Holdings, ET Solar, Hanwha Group, Chint Solar, GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd and Trina Solar Ltd remained unanswered.\u000a\u000aAccording to consulting firm Bridge to India, the Indian solar module market is dominated by Trina Solar (25.7% market share), Hanwha (10.5%) and Risen (7.6%), with domestic manufacturers\u2019 accounting for only 10.6% market share. Waaree Energies\u2019 Rathi stressed that India needs an anti-dumping policy now.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aLast month was the second-warmest May in 137 years of modern record-keeping of average global temperatures, according to NASA.\u000a\u000aThe two top May temperature anomalies have occurred during the past two years. 2016 was the hottest on record, at 0.93 degrees Celsius warmer than the May mean temperature.\u000a\u000aLast month was 0.88 degrees Celsius warmer than the mean May temperature from 1951-1980.\u000a\u000aThis year\u2019s May temperature was 0.05 degrees Celsius cooler than last year. It was just 0.01 degrees Celsius warmer than the third warmest May, which occurred in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe monthly analysis by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is assembled from publicly available data acquired by about 6,300 meteorological stations around the world, ship- and buoy-based instruments measuring sea surface temperature, and Antarctic research stations.\u000a\u000aThe modern global temperature record begins around 1880 because previous observations didn\u2019t cover enough of the planet.

VIllustration: Jayachandran/Mint\u000a\u000aSoon after US President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, leaders of many businesses, universities, states and cities said that they would continue to be committed to battling climate change. Their revolt is interesting because it opens up the possibility of a green strategy that begins from the bottom rather than the top. How effective will such a strategy be?\u000a\u000aClimate change is the classic tragedy of the commons. Nobody owns environmental stability even though everybody depends on it. So everybody\u2019s property is actually nobody\u2019s property. The same dynamic that leads to the overgrazing of common grasslands or overfishing in the high seas also ensures that every person has an incentive to pollute even though the collective burden of such individual action can be catastrophic.\u000a\u000aAlmost all climate change mitigation strategies have focused on an international deal where governments commit their countries to specific targets. Can the problem be approached from the other end?\u000a\u000aElinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in economics for showing how ordinary people can create a framework of rules that help communities tackle the tragedy of the commons. A few days before she died in 2012, Ostrom wrote in an essay that has inspired the headline of this editorial: \u201cWe cannot rely on singular global policies to solve the problem of managing our common resources: the oceans, atmosphere, forests, waterways, and rich diversity of life that combine to create the right conditions for life, including seven billion humans, to thrive. We have never had to deal with problems of the scale facing today\u2019s globally interconnected society. No one knows for sure what will work, so it is important to build a system that can evolve and adapt rapidly. Decades of research demonstrate that a variety of overlapping policies at the city, subnational, national and international levels is more likely to succeed than are single, overarching binding agreements. Such an evolutionary approach to policy provides essential safety nets should one or more policies fail.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is important to note that Ostrom did not keep international agreements out of her list of agencies that should fight climate change. She did not mention companies either. But the underlying point is an interesting one. The risks from climate change are serious enough to require grass-roots action, rather than waiting for a grand international agreement. And it is equally true that only a binding international agreement can impose costs on countries that \u201cdefect\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe subnational challenge is also an important one. India is a classic case\u2014a large country with lots of variations across states. India makes a national commitment to cap its carbon footprint, but does not distinguish between the industrialized states that pollute more than the average and the forested states that act as carbon sinks. There needs to be some mechanism for the former to compensate the latter\u2014an issue that the Thirteenth Finance Commission headed by Vijay Kelkar tried to deal with.\u000a\u000aThe decision of US business, university, state and city leaders to remain committed to the fight against climate change despite the official position of their government on the Paris Agreement is a brave one. Such voluntary action, without binding rules that others will do the same, imposes costs on them. We do not believe that such decentralized action will do the job on its own. Some sort of omnibus international agreement is still needed owing to the inevitable coordination failures.\u000a\u000aYet there are profound possibilities. Large companies that commit to reducing their carbon footprint even in the absence of coercion can make a difference. So can cities that seek to shift from private cars to public transport. Regions with a history of environmental action can also change their energy mix to include more renewables.\u000a\u000aNone of these unilateral actions can ensure that others follow. The incentives for free rides are ever present\u2014City X can continue to pollute while its neighbouring City Y decides to invest in public transport.\u000a\u000aThese are some issues that even Indian companies, states and cities need to grapple with. National climate change commitments are needed, but not everything can be driven from New Delhi. It is worth speculating whether we will see more voluntary action against climate change in India as well\u2014all the more complicated because there is a parallel fight against mass poverty that requires the consumption of more energy.\u000a\u000aCan the global community fight climate change even without an international agreement?

VDonald Trump \u2018proud\u2019 of leaving Paris climate deal. (Reuters).\u000a\u000aUS President Donald Trump strongly defended his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, declaring himself \u201cproud\u201d of the move. \u201cIn order to protect American jobs, companies and workers, we\u2019ve withdrawn the United States from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord,\u201d Trump said to applause, during a speech on the future of the US energy sector. \u201cI will tell you we\u2019re proud of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I go around, there are so many people that say thank you. You saved the sovereignty of our country.\u201d \u201cAnd maybe we\u2019ll be back into it someday, but it will be on better terms,\u201d he vowed. \u201cIt will be on fair terms.\u201d Climate change has become a major bone of contention between the United States and its Western allies, and the issue is set to loom large when Trump meets Group of 20 leaders in Hamburg, Germany next week.\u000a\u000aGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared headed for a collision course with Trump, vowing Thursday to seek a clear commitment to fight global warming from at the July 7-summit, and calling the 2015 Paris deal \u201cnot negotiable.\u201d The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. Trump \u2013 who on the campaign trail labeled climate change a Chinese hoax \u2014 on June 1 announced America\u2019s shock withdrawal from the accord, which he dubbed a \u201cbad\u201d deal. The United States is the world\u2019s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. (AFP) SG 06300413

VWhile releasing a report on renewable energy integration into the power grid, Goyal raised concern on the future of coal-based power plants \u2014 which have traditionally been the baseload electricity source. (PTI)\u000a\u000aAs the country is taking measures to change its energy mix to increase renewable energy contribution, power minister Piyush Goyal acknowledged the contradiction faced by policymakers in the evolving scenario. While releasing a report on renewable energy integration into the power grid, Goyal raised concern on the future of coal-based power plants \u2014 which have traditionally been the baseload electricity source. \u201cThere is a contradiction in terms of coal-based plant growth, renewable energy integration and grid balance,\u201d Goyal said. While confirming the technical and economic viability of integrating 175 GW of renewable energy into India\u2019s power grid by 2022, the report said in such a situation, the plant load factor (PLF) of coal-based power plants would drop by 13 percentage points to 50%, with 65,000 MW plants running at PLFs below 30%.\u000a\u000aTo normalise PLFs of coal-based plants, plants which run below 15% PLF would have to be retired, the report added. That translates into 205 generation units, with a capacity of 46,000 MW and investments of more than Rs 2,30,000 crore. Goyal added that the findings of the study, developed under the US-India bilateral programme \u2018Greening the Grid\u2019, calls for reorienting the policies and regulations to be in line with a scenario where coal and power availability is surplus and renewable energy is cheaper than thermal power.\u000a\u000aThe minister said the country\u2019s plan for sustainable renewable energy is reflected by Coal India and NTPC\u2019s aim of installing 10 GW of solar plants. On the sidelines of the event, a senior government official told FE that the coal-based power stations would face tougher challenge from renewable energy when power storage becomes cheaper \u2014 something which is no longer a distant possibility.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the combined cost of solar power tariff (with storage) comes around Rs 6-8 per unit, whereas coal-based electricity comes at around Rs 4/unit. The report further said 175 GW of renewable energy capacity would generate 370 billion units (BU) of electricity, a 22% share of total electricity consumption in India. Thermal power, with a capacity of 218 GW generated 90 BU in April. 6.9 BU was generated by 57 GW of renewable energy sources in the same period. To boost renewable energy, the government has come up with certain policies such as deemed generation status and exemption on transmission charges.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, renewable purchase obligations also eat into some of the demand for conventional power. However, some subsidies and incentives are being gradually phased out for players in the sector. Accelerated depreciation being halved to 40% and the withdrawal of generation based incentives and 10-year tax holidays.

VThe Modi-Trump summit offers an opportunity to place in context President Donald Trump\u2019s outburst against India earlier this month, as he announced the decision of the US to step away from the Paris climate agreement. If Trump then alleged that India was making its climate pledges conditional on international funding, the India-US joint statement this week strikes a more sobering note, calling for a \u201crational approach that balances environment and \u2026 energy security needs.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth leaders may have succeeded in moving past this moment of bilateral friction but the Paris proposal from the developed world to India was, and remains, simple and stark. First, India would have to create a unique development pathway that lifts its millions out of poverty, without the freedom of careless consumption of fossil fuels. Second, it would have to discover this new pathway by itself. And, finally, despite its self-financed attempt at balancing poverty eradication and climate responsibility, India would be judged and monitored, every inch of the way.\u000a\u000aIn the past India has been accused of being an intransigent climate negotiator. Under Prime Minister Modi, however, India decided to change its climate narrative. Modi positioned India as a country willing to lead in creating a green model that could then be exported to the rest of the world. It helped, of course, that India had already begun its transformation. Eight months before the Paris Agreement, India had already installed 77 GW of renewable energy capacity. At the time, the average Indian, as a relative share of her/his expenditure, spent about 2.5 times more than the average American on renewables. By 2022, India aims to expand its renewable energy capacity to 175 GW and will soon have built up the equivalent of German renewable energy capacity, despite having a size of economy a third smaller than Germany.\u000a\u000aThis transformation underway in India is accompanied by attitudes and decisions in the EU and the US that border on an imperialistic approach to monopolise all available carbon space. With a distinctly condescending tone, developing nations are told by their richer counterparts that demands for \u201csustainability\u201d are premised on ethics and morality, discovered belatedly by the developed countries, after colonisation and exploitation of nations, communities and, indeed, of the carbon space. And as with acts of colonial egregiousness, reparations for carbon colonisation are unavailable.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s outbursts, though disappointing, were part of a continuum of narratives emanating from the West in the recent past. The attacks against China, India and other developing countries prior to the Conference of Parties at Copenhagen in 2009 and their subsequent vilification sowed the seeds of \u201cclimate orientalism\u201d, something that legitimised the current action of the US.\u000a\u000aIn the last seven years, the OECD has added 58 GW of the \u2018dirtiest\u2019 form of energy. Germany still burns three times more coal per capita than India. And as of 2016, when measured against the US, India still obtained a higher percentage of its energy from renewable sources.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, the hypocrisy of the West has not stopped at the water\u2019s edge of fossil fuel usage.\u000a\u000aA small group of developed countries have taken control over the regulatory frameworks governing the Central Banks and financial flows of the world. The competitive prudentialism of the Basel Norms has led to the prioritisation of capital adequacy over credit enhancement. The continued squeezing of sectoral limits driven by the \u2018Old Boys\u2019 Club\u2019 in Basel has led to further roadblocks for the developing world to access commercial capital. The risk assessment through black box techniques has meant that the capital that reaches the developing world is priced significantly higher.\u000a\u000aFurther the sociological aversion of OECD-based pension funds and insurance funds to invest in the \u201cdark and menacing\u201d global south vetoes any possibility of the largest pool of money to participate in infrastructure and developmental activities in emerging economies.\u000a\u000aThere is no denying that carbon imperialism exists. But Trump\u2019s belligerence towards the Paris accords may ironically become its undoing: By highlighting coal and gas, the US president has turned attention on the need for traditional sources. The India-US joint statement cleverly takes advantage of this political impulse and suggests that US energy exports (including coal and gas) should be available to fuel India\u2019s economic development. If ever there was a window of opportunity to dismantle Western shackles on growth and development avenues for the developing world, Trump\u2019s statement personifies it.\u000a\u000aSamir Saran is vice president at the Observer Research Foundation\u000a\u000aThe views expressed are personal

VFormer U.S. President Barack Obama has pointed to the importance of the Paris climate accord while criticizing Donald Trump for pulling the world\u2019s biggest economy out of the pact.\u000a\u000aTrump said last month he would withdraw from the pact and seek to negotiate a better deal, in a move that attracted widespread criticism from counterparts in Europe and elsewhere. The decision by Trump to walk away from the 2015 agreement was also criticized by business leaders, with some describing it as a setback for the environment.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change,\u201d Obama said Saturday in a speech at the opening of the Fourth Congress of the Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. He said it was \u201can agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership will still give our children a fighting chance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe challenges of our times, whether it\u2019s economic inequality, changing climate, terrorism, mass migration; these are really challenges and we\u2019re going to have to confront them together,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aObama, who has been holidaying in Indonesia and on Friday met with President Joko Widodo, also warned in remarks Saturday against rising sectarian politics around the world, as well as growing discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are going to be some big decisions to make about Indonesia and about the United States and about the world in the years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for a while that the world is at a crossroads, at an inflection point.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said in Jakarta there had been \u201cenormous progress\u201d which had occurred \u201cin part because of the stability that the United States helped support here in the Asia Pacific.\u201d\u000a\u000aGlobal Challenges\u000a\u000aBut the former president said there are also challenges, and that globalization and technology had created problems and \u201cshifts in the foundations of societies\u201d and in politics both in developing and developed countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe world is more prosperous than ever before, but this has also brought significant changes that are dangerous.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe start seeing a rise in sectarian politics, we start seeing a rise in an aggressive kind of nationalism, we start seeing both in developed and developing countries an increased resentment about minority groups and the bad treatment of people who don\u2019t look like us or practice the same faith as us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe start seeing discrimination against people based on race or ethnicity or religion.\u201d Those threats must be confronted, Obama said.\u000a\u000aObama, who spent four years in Indonesia as a child, met on Friday with Widodo, known as Jokowi, at Bogor on the outskirts of the capital. \u201cI always found Jokowi to be a man of quiet but firm integrity and somebody who sincerely wants what\u2019s right by all Indonesians,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTheir meeting touched on issues such as infrastructure and economic development, according to Obama, who said Saturday that the U.S. and Indonesia shared the common values of \u201cpluralism and tolerance and openness and rule of law.\u201d

VHow will future climate change affect the poor and how does one address both poverty and climate change? This is a conundrum faced by policymakers in India and other developing countries. Moreover, \u2018climate-proofing\u2019 sustainable development efforts is important; that is to say, current efforts should remain relevant in the face of future climate impacts.\u000a\u000aAmong development practitioners, a paradigm shift has taken place in the last three decades or so: income alone is no longer considered as being sufficient to estimate and address poverty. One can have assets and a reasonable income and yet be poor in terms of education, nutrition, health and other living conditions. Nevertheless, in India and many other countries, governments continue to use income or consumption to estimate poverty, with specified thresholds associated with the \u2018poverty line\u2019.\u000a\u000aOn this basis, using consumption expenditure data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty in India to be at 22% of the population in 2011-12.\u000a\u000aDimensions of poverty\u000a\u000aPeople living in poverty in various parts of the world share multiple conditions and life circumstances that have been measured and studied as a proxy to assessing poverty. Following the work of Amartya Sen, in particular, and other welfare economists and political philosophers, the dimensions that are considered often include living standards, assets, health, income, consumption and status in their societies. Thus, measures such as nutrition, quality of the floor and roof of houses, access to energy services and drinking water, level of education, jobs, and social conditions such as caste all become relevant when one tries to understand the different manifestations of poverty.\u000a\u000aSome countries, such as Mexico, Chile and Colombia, use several dimensions to record poverty using the MPI (Multidimensional Poverty Index), a versatile tool developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) that looks at the dimensions of education, health and standard of living, giving them all equal weightage.\u000a\u000aEach dimension includes several markers or indicators that are measured to recognise deficiencies in each. Those who are deprived in at least a third of the weighted indicators are regarded as poor. Measures such as MPI help us to estimate not only how many people are poor, but also the quality and depth of their poverty. One can also estimate the number of people who are likely to become poor as a result of slight additional deprivations, as well as those who are in extreme poverty. The most recent MPI for India calculated using India Human Development Survey data of 2011-12, estimates that 41% of the people were multi-dimensionally poor.\u000a\u000aThe adverse effects of climate change that are anticipated in South Asia are droughts, floods, heat waves, sea level rise and related problems such as food shortages, spread of diseases, loss of jobs and migration. These will harmfully affect the poorest and further deteriorate the quality of their lives. Numerous studies have shown that the poor suffer the worst effects from climate variability and climate change. One can understand these relationships by recognising that severe storms damage inadequately built houses; floods wash away those living on riverbanks; and the poorest are the most affected by severe droughts that lead to food shortages and higher food prices.\u000a\u000aProjects and programmes designed to help people adapt to the effects of climate change should therefore not inadvertently worsen the living conditions of the poor. Adaptation programmes ought to be designed so that challenges faced by people living in poverty are recognised and reduced. Development policies that consider the context of climate change are often called \u201cclimate proofing development\u201d. But even the experts do not know how this should be done for specific sectors, policies, or particular local situations. Multi-dimensional understanding of poverty becomes important in this context of research and policy.\u000a\u000aMultiple vulnerabilities\u000a\u000aIf one were to estimate the various vulnerabilities for poverty at district levels and then overlay expected climate change impacts for these areas, future local problems due to the combination of these would become clearer for policymakers. It may of course be impossible to predict, with great certainty, the precise impact of future climate change at the local scale and estimate how these may interact with current shortcomings in particular dimensions of poverty. Yet, there is already enough general understanding from different parts of the world to take a commonsensical approach to addressing the combination of multiple vulnerabilities.\u000a\u000aIf we learn for example that a district with severe nutritional deficiency might anticipate extended periods of drought from climate change, then the focus ought to be on improving local food access and to combine this with managing water efficiently to prepare for future water shortages. Similarly, proposed improvements in sanitation and housing ought to factor in the increased likelihood of future flooding events in low-lying areas and use appropriate design strategies that are resilient to water-logging.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, countries agreed to meet 17 universal goals, officially known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs have targets and indicators that cover a broad range of concerns for human welfare. They include food security, education, poverty alleviation, access to safe and adequate water, energy, sanitation and so on.\u000a\u000aThe deadline for reaching the SDGs is 2030. This will be a big test for India and other developing countries because these are in fact the major development challenges that the poor countries have been confronting for decades. India is taking the SDGs quite seriously and the NITI Aayog has been coordinating activities relating to their implementation, and emphasising their interconnected nature across economic, social and environmental pillars.\u000a\u000aYet, it is critical to recognise that climate variability and climate change impacts can prevent us from reaching and maintaining the SDG targets. Measuring poverty through its different dimensions, along with the consumption measures, would help policymakers figure out which aspects of poverty expose the poor and exacerbate their vulnerability to climate change.\u000a\u000aThrough such a process, India could also serve as a standard for other poor and developing countries that are beginning to think about inclusive \u201cclimate proofed development\u201d.\u000a\u000aSujatha Byravan is Principal Research Scientist and Debapriya Das is Senior Research Economist at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP)

VFrench President Emmanuel Macron says his glamorous Paris charm offensive on Donald Trump was carefully calculated \u2014 and may have changed the US president\u2019s mind about climate change.\u000a\u000aMacron defended his outreach to Trump, whose \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies have elicited worry and disdain in Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur countries are friends, so we should be too,\u201d Macron said in an interview Sunday in the Journal du dimanche newspaper.\u000a\u000aAfter a tense, white-knuckle handshake at their first meeting in May, Macron said they gained \u201cbetter, intimate knowledge of each other\u201d during Trump\u2019s visit to Paris last week.\u000a\u000aOn their main point of contention \u2014 Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement \u2014 Macron is quoted as saying that \u201cDonald Trump listened to me. He understood the reason for my position, notably the link between climate change and terrorism.\u201d\u000a\u000aIncreasing droughts and other extreme weather blamed on man-made climate change are worsening migration crises and conflicts in some regions as populations fight over dwindling resources.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe said he would try to find a solution in the coming months. We spoke in detail about what could allow him to return to the Paris deal,\u201d Macron said, according to the newspaper.\u000a\u000aWhile in Paris, Trump remained non-committal about the US eventually rejoining the climate agreement, telling Macron, \u201cif it happens that will be wonderful, and if it doesn\u2019t that will be OK too.\u201d Trump has said the climate deal was unfair to US business.\u000a\u000aThe French leader acknowledged that Trump\u2019s Paris visit \u2014 including a formal welcome at Napoleon\u2019s tomb, dinner in the Eiffel Tower and a place of honour at the annual Bastille Day military parade \u2014 was choreographed to give Americans a \u201cstronger image of France\u201d after deadly Islamic extremist attacks damaged the country\u2019s vital tourism sector.\u000a\u000aIt was also aimed at Trump himself, who has said that Paris has been ruined by the threat of terrorism, which he ties to immigrants.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Donald Trump left having a better image of France than upon his arrival,\u201d Macron is quoted as saying.

VAccording to the report, the projected population in Low-Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ) in 2000 is 63.9 million. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s population along low- elevation coastlines is expected to witness a three-fold rise in the coming decades, says a new report on how climate change will bring devastating consequences to nations in Asia and Pacific. According to the report, the projected population in Low-Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ) in 2000 is 63.9 million. This is, however, projected to increase to 216.4 million by 2060, the report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) claims. Under a business-as-usual scenario, a six degree Celsius temperature increase is projected over the Asian land mass by the end of the century. Some countries in the region could experience significantly hotter climates, with temperature increases in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the northwest part of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) projected to reach eight degree Celsius, it says. The report titled \u2018A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific\u2019 says that more intense typhoons and tropical cyclones are expected to hit Asia and the Pacific with rising global mean temperatures.Under a business-as-usual scenario, annual precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50 per cent over most land areas in the region, although countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan may experience a decline in rainfall by 20-50 per cent.\u000a\u000aAlso Watch:\u000a\u000aCoastal and low-lying areas in the region will be at an increased risk of flooding, it says, adding that 19 of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-meter sea-level rise are located in the region, seven of which are in the Philippines alone. The report says that Indonesia will be the most affected country in the region by coastal flooding with approximately 5.9 million people expected to be affected every year until 2100. Increased vulnerability to flooding and other disasters will significantly impact the region \u2013 and the world \u2013 economically, the report notes. \u201cGlobal flood losses are expected to increase to USD 52 billion per year by 2050 from USD 6 billion in 2005,\u201d it says. It adds that 13 of the top 20 cities with the largest growth of annual flood losses from 2005-2050 are in Asia and the Pacific namely Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhanjiang, and Xiamen (PRC); Mumbai, Chennai-Madras, Surat, and Kolkata (India); Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam); Jakarta (Indonesia); Bangkok (Thailand); and Nagoya (Japan).\u000a\u000aTo mitigate the impact of climate change, the report highlights the importance of implementing the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement. These include public and private investments focused on the rapid decarbonization of the Asian economy as well as the implementation of adaptation measures to protect the region\u2019s most vulnerable populations. \u201cClimate mitigation and adaptation efforts should also be mainstreamed into macro-level regional development strategies and micro-level project planning in all sectors, in addition to the ongoing renewable energy and technology innovation efforts in urban infrastructure and transport. \u201cThe region has both the capacity and weight of influence to move towards sustainable development pathways, curb global emissions, and promote adaptation,\u201d the report concludes.

VUnabated climate change would bring devastating consequences to countries in and the Pacific, which could severely affect their future growth, reverse current development gains, and degrade quality of life, according to a report produced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).\u000a\u000aUnder a business-as-usual scenario, a 6 degree Celsius temperature increase is projected over the Asian landmass by the end of the century. Some countries in the region could experience significantly hotter climates, with temperature increases in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the northwest part of the People's Republic of (PRC) projected to reach 8 degree Celsius, according to the report, titled A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in and the Pacific.\u000a\u000aThese increases in temperature would lead to drastic changes in the region's weather system, agriculture and fisheries sectors, land and marine biodiversity, domestic and regional security, trade, urban development, migration, and health. Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development.\u000a\u000aThe global climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge human civilization faces in the 21st century, with the and Pacific region at the heart of it all, said Bambang Susantono, ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development. Home to two-thirds of the world's poor and regarded as one of the most vulnerable region to climate change, countries in Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty and disaster if mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented.\u000a\u000a"The Asian countries hold Earth's future in their hands. If they choose to protect themselves against dangerous climate change, they will help to save the entire planet, said Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, PIK Director. The challenge is twofold. On the one hand, Asian greenhouse-gas emissions have to be reduced in a way that the global community can limit planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in Paris 2015. Yet even adapting to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise is a major task. So, on the other hand, Asian countries have to find strategies for ensuring prosperity and security under unavoidable climate change within a healthy global development. But note that leading the clean industrial revolution will provide Asia with unprecedented economic opportunities. And exploring the best strategies to absorb the shocks of environmental change will make Asia a crucial actor in 21st-century multilateralism."\u000a\u000aMore intense typhoons and tropical cyclones are expected to hit Asia and the Pacific with rising global mean temperatures. Under a business-as-usual scenario, annual precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50% over most land areas in the region, although countries like and may experience a decline in rainfall by 20-50%.\u000a\u000aCoastal and low-lying areas in the region will be at an increased risk of flooding. Nineteen of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-meter sea-level rise are located in the region, 7 of which are in the Philippines alone. Indonesia, however, will be the most affected country in the region by coastal flooding with approximately 5.9 million people expected to be affected every year until 2100.\u000a\u000aIncreased vulnerability to flooding and other disasters will significantly impact the region and the world economically.\u000a\u000aGlobal flood losses are expected to increase to $52 billion per year by 2050 from $6 billion in 2005. Moreover, 13 of the top 20 cities with the largest growth of annual flood losses from 2005-2050 are in Asia and the Pacific: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhanjiang, and Xiamen (PRC); Mumbai, Chennai-Madras, Surat, and Kolkata (India); Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam); Jakarta (Indonesia); Bangkok (Thailand); and Nagoya (Japan).\u000a\u000aClimate change will also make food production in the region more difficult and production costs higher. In some countries of Southeast Asia, rice yields could decline by up to 50% by 2100 if no adaptation efforts are made. Almost all crops in Uzbekistan, meanwhile, are projected to decrease by 20-50% by 2050 even in a 2 degree Celsius temperature increase (Paris Agreement scenario). Food shortages could increase the number of malnourished children in South Asia by 7 million, as import costs will likely increase in the subregion to $15 billion per year compared to $2 billion by 2050.\u000a\u000aMarine ecosystems, particularly in the Western Pacific, will be in serious danger by 2100. All coral reef systems in the subregion will collapse due to mass coral bleaching if global warming increases by 4 degree Celsius (global business-as-usual scenario). Even with a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase, 89% of coral reefs are expected to suffer from serious bleaching, severely affecting reef-related fisheries and tourism in Southeast Asia.\u000a\u000aClimate change also poses a significant risk to health in Asia and the Pacific. Already, 3.3 million people die every year due to the harmful effects of outdoor air pollution, with the PRC, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh being the top four countries experiencing such deaths. In addition, heat-related deaths in the region among the elderly are expected to increase by about 52,000 cases by 2050 due to climate change, according to data from the World Health Organization. Deaths related to vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue may also increase.\u000a\u000aA business-as-usual approach to climate change could also disrupt functioning ecosystem services, prompting mass migration mostly to urban areas that could make cities more crowded and overwhelm available social services.\u000a\u000aMoreover, a warmer climate for the region could endanger energy supply. Climate change can exacerbate energy insecurity through continued reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels, reduced capacities of thermal power plants due to a scarcity of cooling water, and intermittent performance of hydropower plants as a result of uncertain water discharges, among other factors. Energy insecurity could lead to conflicts as countries compete for limited energy supply.\u000a\u000aTo mitigate the impact of climate change, the report highlights the importance of implementing the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement. These include public and private investments focused on the rapid decarbonization of the Asian economy as well as the implementation of adaptation measures to protect the region's most vulnerable populations. Climate mitigation and adaptation efforts should also be mainstreamed into macro-level regional development strategies and micro-level project planning in all sectors, in addition to the ongoing renewable energy and technology innovation efforts in urban infrastructure and transport. The region has both the capacity and weight of influence to move towards sustainable development pathways, curb global emissions, and promote adaptation, the report concludes.\u000a\u000aADB approved a record $3.7 billion in climate financing in 2016 and has committed to further scale up its investments to $6 billion by 2020.\u000a\u000aPowered by Capital Market - Live News\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aEven in years of good rainfall and availability of water, soaring temperatures owing to climate change could significantly cut into the earnings of farmers, shows a study claiming to be the first of its kind in the State.\u000a\u000aThe variations in yield to temperature of paddy, jowar, toor, and ragi, which covers the major crops sown in the State, were scrutinised in the study \u201cClimate variability and climate change in Karnataka\u201d, commissioned by Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission (KAPC).\u000a\u000aUnirrigated paddy, jowar grown during the rabi season (September to October), ragi and toor were found to be sensitive to exposure to extreme temperatures; and in the case of jowar, the effect of extreme heat was more than the effect owing to variation in rainfall. Not just that, consecutive days of extreme heat even negatively overwhelmed positive effects of good rainfall and average temperature.\u000a\u000a\u201cRoughly, even short-term exposures to extreme heat, where temperatures cross the critical limit for growth, of between eight to 21 days can lower yield of these crops,\u201d said Kamal Kumar Murari, Assistant Professor at Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, who along with his colleagues, T. Jayaraman, Sandeep Mahato, and Madhura Swaminathan from Indian Statistical Institute in Bengaluru conducted the study.\u000a\u000aThe team sought to look at the effect of global warming and climate change in the point of temperatures and not just rainfall which has been studied extensively. Taking taluk climatic data and crop yield data over the years, researchers looked at the impact of rainfall, temperatures leading to growth of cultivated crop, as well as extreme temperatures which surpass the \u201ccritical temperatures\u201d of crops.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the critical temperature of paddy is on the lower end at 33C, while for toor and ragi, it is 35C. However, with the average temperatures of plainlands of Karnataka increasing at more than 0.75C every century, the extreme temperatures are now being seen at a greater frequency than ever. Often, the factor of extreme temperatures outweighs the negative impact of variable rainfall, the study found.\u000a\u000aThis is, however, only the first step to studying the effect of heat, and more crop-specific and block-level research needed to be done so that the State is prepared for climate change, said Ms. Swaminathan. \u201cThere is a shortfall of climate data, which is critical as temperature and rainfall vary in short spaces. This research is to find out the impact and prepare for the future...there is a need in learning how we can cope with climate change that will continue to exasperate issues afflicting agriculture,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aKAPC chief T.N. Prakash Kammardi said that while climate change studies have so far focussed on water and rainfall, this study was commissioned to understand impact of heat itself. \u201cThe climate change challenge in all its aspects is emerging now. In the West, they have done extensive studies, but we have only started now...there are drought-resistent crops, but heat-stress resistent crops are yet to be developed,\u201d he said.

VAn intensifying water cycle will likely cause dramatic increases - nearing 20 percent by 2100 - in the amount of in the U.S., according to a new study.\u000a\u000aAccording to researchers, excessive nitrogen that mixes with rivers and estuaries can profoundly affect water systems; for example it can spur algal blooms, which have negative impacts on human health, aquatic ecosystems and the economy.\u000a\u000aFuture changes in precipitation patterns, induced by climate change, could strongly influence the degree of future nitrogen runoff; however most analyses have been limited to local regions and only rely on a small handful of climate models.\u000a\u000aEva Sinha and colleagues analysed anticipated changes in precipitation according to 21 different climate models, each of which was run for three climate scenarios (varying from aggressive efforts to mitigate climate change to a "business-as-usual" scenario), and two time periods (near future, 2031-2060; and far-future, 2071-2100).\u000a\u000aAcross the continental United States as a whole, models consistently estimate that nitrogen loading will increase under all three scenarios, for both time periods.\u000a\u000aUnder a far-future 'business-as-usual' scenario, the mean projected increase in nitrogen loading within the continental United States is 19 percent, with the Northeast, the upper Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin and the Great Lakes basin experiencing the largest increases, the authors report.\u000a\u000aTo put these numbers in perspective, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently recommends reducing nitrogen input in the Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin by 20 percent relative to 1980-1996 levels to mitigate the negative effects of nitrogen that flows into the Gulf of Mexico.\u000a\u000aHowever, with the estimated changes in precipitation, a 62 percent reduction in nitrogen input would be required to achieve a similar objective.\u000a\u000aSybil P. Seitzinger and Leigh Phillips discuss these results, as well as ways to reduce nitrogen use, in a related perspective.\u000a\u000aThe findings appear in journal\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VNew research from an international collaboration of atmospheric scientists, including from India, has explored for the first time the possibility of using a "cocktail" of geo-engineering tools to reduce changes in both temperature and precipitation caused by atmospheric greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas not only cause the earth to get hotter but also affect weather patterns around the world. Management approaches need to address both warming and changes in the amount of rainfall and other forms of precipitation.\u000a\u000aThe team which includes Carnegie Institution's Ken Caldeira, Long Cao and Lei Duan of Zhejiang University, and Govindasamy Bala of the Indian Institute of Science used models to simulate what would happen if sunlight is scattered by particles at the same time as the cirrus clouds were thinned.\u000a\u000aThey wanted to understand how effective this combined set of tools would be at reversing climate change, both globally and regionally.\u000a\u000a"As far as I know, this is the first study to try to model using two different geoengineering approaches simultaneously to try to improve the overall fit of the technology," Caldeira explained.\u000a\u000aSolar geoengineering (such as injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere) has been proposed as a means to counteract this climate change by deliberately deflecting more sunlight from the earth's climate system.\u000a\u000aHowever, climate-modeling studies have shown that while this scattering of sunlight should reduce the warming caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it would tend to reduce rainfall and other types of precipitation.\u000a\u000aIt has also been suggested that the earth could be cooled by thinning cirrus clouds. This would also reduce warming, but would not correct the increase in precipitation caused by global warming.\u000a\u000aOne method reduces rain too much. Another method reduces rain too little.\u000a\u000aThis is where the theoretical cocktail shaker gets deployed.\u000a\u000a"We simulate climate effect of cocktail geoengineering that combines stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase and cirrus cloud thinning. Cocktail geoengineering can offset carbon dioxide-induced changes in global mean temperature and precipitation simultaneously," the experts say in the study published in the Geophysical Research Letters.\u000a\u000aThe good news is the simulations showed that if both methods are deployed in concert, it would decrease warming to pre-industrial levels, as desired, and on a global level rainfall would also stay at pre-industrial levels.\u000a\u000aHowever, while global average climate was largely restored, substantial differences remained locally, with some areas getting much wetter and other areas getting much drier.\u000a\u000a"The same amount of rain fell around the globe in our models, but it fell in different places, which could create a big mismatch between what our economic infrastructure expects and what it will get," Caldeira added.\u000a\u000a"More complicated geoengineering solutions would likely do a bit better, but the best solution is simply to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000asgh/amit/vm\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VHumanity is consuming natural resources faster and faster, if we were to look at the history of Earth Overshoot Day (EOD). First calculated by economist Andrew Simms, EOD represents the day, each year, when the world goes into deficit spending \u2014 ecologically speaking. The day, this year, is Wednesday, August 2.\u000a\u000aSimply speaking, the day the world completely consumes all the natural resources produced that year is EOD, or the day when our consumption exceeds the earth\u2019s capacity to regenerate natural resources.\u000a\u000aSince it was first calculated, the EOD has been moving up the calendar, from December 19 in 1987 to August 2 this year \u2014 just seven months into the year \u2014 revealing the shocking rate at which environmental degradation is taking place.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Global Footprint Network, which calculates EOD every year, about 60 per cent of the world\u2019s ecological footprint is made up by carbon emissions, which the world is attempting to curb under the Paris climate change agreement.\u000a\u000aHowever, voluntary emission cuts are not enough to keep the planet on a sustainable footing. \u201cIf we cut carbon emissions in half, the date of Earth Overshoot Day would be pushed back by 89 days, or about three months,\u201d the Network says.\u000a\u000aThis means that possibility would take us to October 30, still leaving a deficit of two months.\u000a\u000aOverfishing, wastage of food, overharvesting forest resources are all factors that are contributing to the rapid exhaustion of the world\u2019s natural resources, resulting in depletion, poverty, and a large number of species facing extinction. According to estimates, to sustain the current level of consumption, we need a whole new earth by 2030.\u000a\u000a\u201cEconomic growth and development is critical for India \u2014 improved education, health, and job opportunities along with better infrastructure are much needed,\u201d said Sejal Worah, Programme Director, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) India.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, if not properly planned and implemented, such growth can also pose a significant challenge to the natural environment. The future lies in development trajectories that also reduce humanity\u2019s ecological footprint. We need to adopt innovative technology and sustainable lifestyles and to preserve this planet \u2014 citizens, business and government must all play their part,\u201d she added.\u000a\u000aThe World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s (WWF) Living Planet Report, released in 2016, had said there was a 58 per cent decline in global populations of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles between 1970 and 2012.

One per cent increase of monthly averaged relative humidity is estimated to increase one pneumonia patient at any given month,\u201d said Dr Akhilesh Gupta, adviser and head, Climate Change Programme, Department of Science & Technology.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne-degree increase in given monthly temperature will increase the load of one diarrhoea patient monthly. Vector borne diseases are directly affected by relative humidity. High temperature with constant dew point increases relative humidity and thus vector survival. Dengue and Malaria patients showed increasing monthly malaria cases by 5 with 1 degree Celsius rise in minimum monthly temperature and by 1 patient with increase in 1% relative humidity. Encephalitis showed an increase of two patient load with monthly increase of 1 degree Celsius in maximum temperature,\u201d said Dr R.K. Mall, Department of Science and Technology, Mahaman Centre for Excellence in Climate Change Research, BHU. The study has also been published in the latest issue of MAUSAM, a journal of IMD.\u000a\u000aSir Sunder Lal Hospital was chosen because it is the only Tertiary Care Hospital providing specialty and Super Specialty services to the health care needs of about 200 million people in eastern UP, western Bihar, adjoining MP, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand as well as Nepal.\u000a\u000aThe time series analysis of maximum temperature showed an increase of 0.04 degree Celsius per decade while minimum temperature showed increase by 0.02 degree Celsius per decade. Since 2004-2014 the total number of days above 45 degree Celsius was 8 and above 40 degree Celsius were 44 days per year. The total extreme rainfall days above 50 mm per day were 16 in 2004-2014.\u000a\u000a\u201cClimate variability and human health are complex and multi-layered and predictions of the future health impact of climate change are still uncertain. Over India the annual and seasonal maximum and minimum temperature has increased during the last decades and projection of the future climate scenarios also shows extreme events will exhibit an increase in frequency and intensity resulting in disastrous impact on human life in terms of death toll and disease epidemic,\u201d said Dr Gupta.

VNEW DELHI: India has insisted on its rightful dues from international sources in its fight against climate change and any statement to the contrary is "factually incorrect", the government informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.US President Donald Trump , after pulling out from the Paris agreement, had argued that India would get billions of dollars for meeting its commitment under the pact and also double its coal-fired power plants, gaining a financial advantage over the United States.Replying to a question, the Environment Ministry said that a major part of India's climate actions are funded from domestic sources and external sources have contributed "very little".The government said that in light of the principles of Equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), based on historical emissions, developed countries are required to assist developing countries in climate actions."India has insisted on its rightful dues from international sources of funding but continues to take action as per resource availability," it said.

Photo: HT\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: Each degree Celsius increase in the global mean temperature would, on average, reduce global yields of wheat by 6%, rice by 3.2%, maize by 7.4% and soybean by 3.1%, says a study.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the US scientific journal \u2018Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 (PNAS) on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aNoting that crops are sensitive to climate change, including changes in temperature and precipitation, the study explained that among the changes temperature increase has the most likely negative impact on crop yields.\u000a\u000a\u201cWheat, rice, maize, and soybean provide two-thirds of human caloric intake. Assessing the impact of global temperature increase on production of these crops is therefore critical to maintaining global food supply..,\u201d the study said.\u000a\u000a\u201cResults from the different methods consistently showed negative temperature impacts on crop yield at the global scale, generally underpinned by similar impacts at country and site scales..,\u201d the study said.\u000a\u000aAmong the four crops\u2014wheat, rice, maize and soybean\u2014loss in yield for each degree Celsius increase in global mean temperature is largest for maize.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe impact estimates are consistently negative for four major maize producers, together responsible for two-thirds of global maize production\u2014United States, China, Brazil and India,\u201d it added.\u000a\u000aFor wheat, the study said estimated yield losses for \u201cIndia and Russia are more vulnerable to temperature increase\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe study stressed that \u201cimpacts of increasing temperatures on major global crops show substantial risks for agricultural production, already stagnating in some parts of the world. However, differences in temperature responses of crops around the world suggest that some mitigation could be possible to substantially affect the magnitude (or even direction) of climate change impacts on agriculture.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt, however, noted that these impacts will also vary substantially for crops and regions and highlighted that a \u201creinvigoration of national research and extension programs is urgently needed to offset future impacts of climate change, including temperature increase on agriculture by using crop- and region-specific adaptation strategies\u201d.\u000a\u000aTo control the rise in global temperature, the world finalized a new global climate deal, \u2018Paris Climate Agreement\u2019 in December 2015, which aims to limit rise in global temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times and make efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of 2100.\u000a\u000aThe study noted that, \u201cfarmers have increased yields through adapting new technologies during the last half-century, but yield has been also lost through increases in temperatures already\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cYield increase has slowed down or even stagnated during the last years in some parts of the world, and further increases in temperature will continue to suppress yields, despite farmers\u2019 adaptation efforts,\u201d it added.

VIndia is the third largest carbon emitter in the world. India\u2019s per capita energy consumption at 25 GJ, however, represents approximately a quarter of the energy required for a decent quality of life. The global trajectory to a low carbon economy that limits global warming induced climate change needs to be balanced with the developmental needs of developing countries, including India. This calls for innovative and affordable solutions.\u000a\u000aIndian businesses are already cognisant of the risks of climate change, including adverse implications for corporate reputation including customer rejection of products and services of companies that do not demonstrate progressive environmental credentials. The economic loss in excess of $2 billion caused by the Chennai floods of 2015, an extreme climate event, the second costliest insurance event in India\u2019s history, brought home to corporate India the possible adverse impacts of climate change.Smart businesses are seeing the opportunities in an increasingly fragile environment. They are creating new products and services, such as drought and pest resistant crops, micro irrigation solutions, big data based smart grid solutions, and renewable energy systems. Enlightened companies are also embracing the concept of the circular economy, where resources are circulated within the system releasing minimal waste into the biosphere, and focusing on sustainable supply chain management; for instance, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s REALCAR (REcycled ALuminium CAR) project reclaims over 50,000 tonnes of aluminium \u2013 the weight of 200,000 XE body shells in one year.\u000a\u000aThe government, meanwhile, is putting in place regulatory frameworks to measure and monitor consumption and emission. In February 2017, the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) suggested that the top 500 companies adopt Integrated Reporting on a voluntary basis from FY 2017-18. The report of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure set up by the Financial Stability Board advocates that businesses disclose material climate-related risks in their financial filings, and Indian companies like Tata Steel are already making such disclosures.\u000a\u000aA huge body of research by public policy institutes is also emerging to offer pathways to a low carbon future. The Energy Transitions Commission is exploring how we can accelerate change towards low-carbon energy systems that enable robust economic development and limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2C. The Commission forecasts progress on four dimensions: One, decarbonisation of power, combined with extended electrification. Two, decarbonisation of difficult to electrify activities, through routes such as fuel substitution, carbon capture and storage or use, and product substitution. Three, acceleration in the pace of energy productivity improvement, including the shift towards more service-based and digital economies, more efficient urban design, and the development of a circular and sharing economy. And finally, optimisation of fossil fuel use.\u000a\u000aThe state of the environment calls for a collaborative approach from all stakeholders. With proactive governance and enlightened corporate leadership, we may just win the battle against climate change.\u000a\u000aMukund Govind Rajan is chairman \u2013 FICCI Environment Committee\u000a\u000aThe views expressed are personal

VNEW DELHI: Union Ministers Piyush Goyal Suresh Prabhu and Dharmendra Pradhan along with CEOs from top global firms and key policymakers will deliberate upon the impact of current business actions on climate change at a summit here later this month.The Business and Climate Summit , which is being held for the first time in India from August 31 - September 1, will emphasise the future vision around a low carbon trajectory and build on the partnerships needed to scale up and accelerate the low carbon transition.The Summit was launched in France in 2015. The second edition was held in London in 2016."The summit is taking place at a critical time when India is now at the centre of a global debate on the subject of sustainability."It is still widely acknowledged that India's trajectory to a low carbon economy when it wards off global warming and induced climate change will need to be balanced even today with the developmental needs of our country," Mukund Rajan, Chairman, Ficci Environment Committee, said at a press conference here.Key policymakers including Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant and Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa will share their perspectives on the issues surrounding business and climate at the summit.Representatives from some top global and Indian organisations will also address the event, including Akzo Nobel Bank of America Merrill Lynch , China Carbon Forum, Essar Oil and European Climate Foundation, among others.Ficci past President Naina Lal Kidwai observed that a significant number of jobs will be created in the clean and green energy segment and technology and services in low-carbon space, going forward.She batted for the creation of an ecosystem that enables the private sector to participate in the delivery of public goods and services in a 'for-profit model' and in areas like waste management and treatment."We don't want monopolistic practices that cause the citizens to suffer but they (government) have to recognise that there has to be money in it to attract the private sector," Kidwai said.CEOs from 34 companies are expected to address the summit.

VEnergy security is perhaps the most powerful lever that pivots the growth trajectory of an economy irrespective of the country\u2019s political milieu. Massive international efforts invested in decarbonization over the past few decades have proven that renewable energy, with its enduring potential is no doubt a far more potent propeller of inclusive development than its conventional counterparts. Ideologically too, this movement toward greener energy is redefining what it means to be a responsible entity, be it individual, corporate or nation.\u000a\u000aIndia has a vociferous renewable energy agenda articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Power Minister Piyush Goyal in various fora. The momentum created in the march towards achieving 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022 has resulted in India overtaking US for the first time, in Ernst and Young's Renewable Energy Attrictiveness Index. Bold as India may be in pursuing and even leading the second innings of a global energiewinde, the journey may not come without impediments.\u000a\u000aMaking rooftop solar a success story \u2013 challenges and opportunities\u000a\u000aMuch has been written about India\u2019s ambitious targets for renewable energy. Amidst the clamoring optimism about the efficacy of the combined machinery of government and private enterprise to achieve these targets, it is important to look at challenges in rooftop solar sector\u2013 intended to account for 40 GW of the total 100 GW allotted to solar in India\u2019s grand renewable plan.\u000a\u000aDespite an attractive capital subsidy of 30 per cent and a slew of other incentives by state governments, challenges remain in promoting residential rooftop installations as compared to potential capacity. In a larger sense, it is not only residential rooftop that needs handholding but the entire rooftop segment as a whole. The problem is mainly two pronged \u2013 overcoming infrastructure woes and deftly shaping a policy to outline commercial requirements like a well-defined financial lending model or insurance scheme and technical preconditions that specify a mandatory standard or code for installation, operation and maintenance. A key to tackling these issues is to understand the long-term implications of renewable energy investment.\u000a\u000aBuilding the right infrastructure\u000a\u000aPrimarily, rooftop solar is more of a \u2018distributed generation\u2019 activity, requiring an overhaul in energy infrastructure \u2013 a daunting challenge in itself. State DISCOMs, for instance, do not have a line for evacuation of solar power. The non-availability of power evacuation infrastructure only hastens the necessity to install advanced technologies for energy storage like battery solutions, which only exacerbate the cost of power.\u000a\u000aApart from facing the prospect of piling on new connections to the grid and preventing grid collapse, nurturing solar rooftop would obviously require combating voltage fluctuations, tripping and interference - challenges that are associated with relaying PV power through the grid. Net metering can be effective once these infrastructure challenges are effectively addressed at the ground level.\u000a\u000aThe formidable UDAY scheme, aimed at resurrecting ailing DISCOMs has ushered in an era of much awaited power reforms by making provisions for financial turnaround, operational improvement and reduction in cost of power generation. Most opportunely, the scheme enables the development of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy conservation. It is, thus, high time for DISCOMs to step up and support the renewable energy mission by prioritizing their spending to improve power evacuation infrastructure for rooftop solar system. A well-defined power evacuation process bound by a dedicated timeline and technical standards programme will greatly help in maintaining power quality and meeting national grid code compliance requirements.\u000a\u000aThe infrastructure challenges are not related to the grid alone but permeate the financial ecosystem of the rooftop solar sector as well. To sustain consumer interest, the need of the hour is an innovative financing model for rooftop solar similar to attractive property loans with affordable interest rates and EMI options. Asset Insurance is another major challenge. For example, in case the project is endangered by debilitating factors like a hurricane or even monkey menace, with no insurance mechanism for the small-scale rooftop segment, the IPP is straddled with bearing the cost burden in case of damages.\u000a\u000aFalling solar tariffs may have steamrolled investment in the sector, the flipside of the issue is the impact on module makers. Currently, it is estimated that more than 85% of modules, worth nearly 2.5 bn USD are imported, from no less than 30 countries, owing to foreign funded projects, where developers may insist on buying panels from preferred vendors. In case profit margins keep getting narrower in the wake of crashing tariffs, it would further impact module makers and also the IPPs. These crashing tariffs will have spillover effect on rooftop solar segment as well putting unrealistic demand on the price point of electricity generated.\u000a\u000aHow standards and a conformity assessment programme can help in building a robust rooftop policy\u000a\u000aFor a fast-evolving sector like solar, laying an elaborate, watertight system of standards will provide the much-needed ground to help stakeholders in stabilizing the industry. It is thus imperative that India channelizes the positive environment to develop a rigorous standards ecosystem, encapsulating the entire solar value chain.\u000a\u000aIndia needs mandatory standards and a robust conformity assessment programme governing the quality of the solar systems, solar modules and other paraphernalia. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) regulation released in 2013 states that \u2018the effect of wind, storm, floods, lighting, elevation, temperature extremes, icing, contamination, pollution and earthquakes must be considered in the design and operation of the connected facilities\u2019. It is important to verify if these factors are accounted for at the design stage of the project, in order to ensure reliability and durability. Also, as the founding nation of the International Solar Alliance, perhaps India can take the lead in establishing standards for evaluating the quality of modules over time.\u000a\u000aFor any power generating unit, much more so in case of a rooftop solar module, there is no guarantee for reliability of power supply. Hence, to avoid grid failure, it is essential that the government mandates Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) testing to examine the ability of the rooftop project in supplying power without destabilizing the grid. It would, therefore, bode well to mandate and implement the technical standards for grid connectivity for wind and solar stations laid down by the Central Electrical Authority in 2013.\u000a\u000aDegradation for any solar project begins roughly three years after installation, by when the financiers have already planned their exit. To prevent the IPP from shouldering the brunt of operational and maintenance issues, in the absence of an evolved insurance policy framework, it is vital that nonresidential rooftop power purchase agreements allow for a significant amount in escrow, to enable the IPP to bear the risks without shutting down the project. In the uncertain climate of module manufacturers shutting shop, the PPAs should also mandate appropriate technology transfer to the IPP before conclusion of the contract.\u000a\u000aConclusion\u000a\u000aAs the Indian solar industry matures, it is inevitable that the government will no longer be able to offer generous subsidies to stimulate growth. Establishing a comprehensive standards and conformity assessment ecosystem is therefore critical to sustain the development of the industry, not just till 2022, but beyond. India already embarked on an admirable mission to develop reliable and sustainable energy programme. It will no doubt consolidate India\u2019s position as a global green power, with the planned 100 GW of solar capacity, and the resultant Twh of reliable energy bearing proud testimony to the government\u2019s commitment of reduction in carbon footprints.\u000a\u000aDISCLAIMER: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETEnergyworld.com does not necessarily subscribe to it.

VHurricane Harvey is yet another of several recent weather disasters marked by such shocking staying power, punishing whole regions for days or weeks on end\u2014and longer. Photo: Reuters/Nasa\u000a\u000aNew York: Meteorologists explain that Hurricane Harvey stalled off the Texas coast because two high-pressure atmospheric masses\u2014huge bookends made out of air\u2014have squeezed it in place, and there haven\u2019t been any high-level currents to help steer it away.\u000a\u000aHarvey is yet another of several recent weather disasters marked by such shocking staying power, punishing whole regions for days or weeks on end\u2014and longer. Others include a massive heatwave over Russia and flooding in Pakistan in 2010, the Texas drought of 2011, the California drought that began around the same time and continued through this year, and the flooding last year in Texas\u2019s neighbour to east, Louisiana.\u000a\u000aSluggishness in storms is a big deal, particularly if they\u2019re increasing in frequency. \u201cIt turns a garden-variety disaster into a catastrophe,\u201d said Paul Douglas, a broadcast meteorologist and weather entrepreneur. As Harvey stays put, it functions as a firehose that sucks warm water from the Gulf of Mexico and the atmosphere, and dumps it inland. As of this writing, meteorologists predict Harvey will move north-northeast Wednesday, and up into the Mississippi basin on Friday.\u000a\u000aJust to be clear, climate change itself is no longer up for debate\u2014both in the scientific community and among national governments (with few notable exceptions). Understanding it is relatively simple. Global average temperatures are rising. There\u2019s at least 4% more water vapour in the air than 70 years ago. Ice sheets are melting. Seas are swelling. These phenomena are the direct effects of warming, and humans are causing it.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the part of the science everyone agrees about,\u201d said Adam Sobel, professor of applied physics and math, and Earth science, at Columbia University.\u000a\u000aWhat experts don\u2019t agree on, however, is whether\u2014or how much\u2014manmade climate change is responsible for this meteorological stickiness that\u2019s kept Harvey over South Texas.\u000a\u000aThe questions scientists are now asking about stalling storms aren\u2019t along the lines of \u201cdid climate change cause the hurricane?\u201d Climate change didn\u2019t cause the hurricane. But today\u2019s warmer water and more humid air provided it with rocket fuel, making it more intense, and humanity did conjure those conditions.\u000a\u000aInstead, the experts are asking how huge, \u201cdynamic\u201d atmospheric systems may be changing, at least indirectly, because of humanity\u2019s prodigious greenhouse gas pollution. So, a better question might be, \u201cDoes humanity have anything to do with summertime Northern Hemisphere storms that are prevented from moving off because of changes in the jet stream?\u201d The answer is there\u2019s not enough evidence in yet.\u000a\u000aMichael Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, published an essay Monday in which, among items better understood about hurricanes and warming, he included:\u000a\u000a\u201cMore tenuous, but possibly relevant still, is the fact that very persistent, nearly \u2018stationary\u2019 summer weather patterns of this sort, where weather anomalies [...] stay locked in place for many days at a time, appears to be favoured by human-caused climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn March, Mann and several colleagues published a study in the journal Scientific Reports that demonstrates a relationship between extreme events, such as the 2011 Texas drought and 2010 Pakistan flooding, and a rare stationary phase that upper atmospheric currents sometimes go through in the mid-latitudes.\u000a\u000aStefan Rahmstorf, a co-author of that paper and head of Earth Systems Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, explained that there may really be several things going on. In general, the jet stream, the high-flying river of air that flows west-to-east, has slowed and gone all wavy in recent summers, with pronounced north-south meanders. That\u2019s one thing that may have helped hold Harvey in place. Researchers have sparred since 2012 over whether Arctic warming, which is occurring at twice the global average, is driving this atmospheric wobble, consequently creating more opportunities for persistent weather farther south.\u000a\u000aIn a number of extreme cases analyzed by their paper\u2014California drought, Russia\u2019s 2010 heatwave and Pakistan\u2019s related flood\u2014the meandering north-south river of the jet-stream stabilizes for periods of time in some places, creating an insurmountable wavelike band. The researchers looked for some kind of misbehaviour in atmospheric circulation after realizing that heat-related effects alone couldn\u2019t explain the extreme nature of some disasters.\u000a\u000aNot everybody\u2019s sold on either the general jet-stream wobbliness from a warming Arctic, or the stabilizing atmospheric waves described by Mann, Rahmstorf, and colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s still controversial,\u201d Sobel said. Even Mann, the lead-author, introduced the pattern as \u201ctenuous,\u201d and Rahmstorf said that more real-world case studies and more years of observations are needed.\u000a\u000aWith Houston still under siege and the hurricane season still churning, the thought of more case studies is the last thing anybody wants to consider. And yet, just as it took decades to prove climate change, time and more studies will likely show whether humans have gone beyond global warming, and in fact changed which way the wind blows.

VThe Caspian Sea, the largest inland body of water on Earth, has been slowly evaporating for the past two decades due to rising temperatures associated with climate change, a research has found.\u000a\u000aWater levels in the Caspian Sea dropped nearly seven centimetres per year from 1996 to 2015, or nearly 1.5 metres total, according to the findings published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\u000a\u000aAccording to the data from the study, the average yearly surface temperature over the Caspian Sea rose by about one degree Celsius between the two timeframes studied, 1979-1995 and 1996-2015.\u000a\u000aThese rising temperatures are likely a result of climate change, the study said.\u000a\u000aEvaporation brought about by warming temperatures appears to be the primary cause of the current drop in sea level and the decline will likely continue as the planet warms, the researchers said.\u000a\u000a"From our point of view as geoscientists, it's an interesting place because it's possible to construct a sort of budget for the total amount of water that's there," said study co-author Clark Wilson, a geophysicist with the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas in Austin.\u000a\u000a"The real control that causes it to go up and down over long periods of time is really most likely the evaporation, which is almost completely dominated by temperature," Wilson said.\u000a\u000aThe Caspian Sea, located between Europe and Asia, covers roughly 371,000 square kilometres. The sea contains oil and natural gas reserves, and is an important resource for fisheries in the surrounding countries.\u000a\u000aThe researchers looked at the three primary influences on Caspian Sea water levels -- water from rivers that drain into the sea, precipitation and evaporation.\u000a\u000aThey compiled information about water level changes observed by satellites, records of precipitation and drainage into the sea from rivers, and estimations of precipitation and evaporation from climate models.\u000a\u000aThe researchers then assembled a record of how much each of these factors contributed to observed changes in the Caspian Sea level from 1979 to 2015.\u000a\u000aThey found Caspian Sea levels increased by about 12 centimetres per year from 1979-1995. But in 1996, sea levels began to drop, and declined by an average of nearly seven centimetres per year through 2015.\u000a\u000aEvaporation contributed to about half of that decline, while the combined effects of precipitation and river discharge changes contributed to the other half.\u000a\u000aThe observed evaporation rates are associated with increased surface air temperature and other climate factors such as surface humidity and wind, the study said.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000agb/bg\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VFrom Houston all the way to Mumbai and from Nepal to the desert state of Rajasthan, rains have cut a swathe of destruction with flooded streets and thousands marooned as their cities and villages go under. (Image: Reuters)\u000a\u000aFrom Houston all the way to Mumbai and from Nepal to the desert state of Rajasthan, rains have cut a swathe of destruction with flooded streets and thousands marooned as their cities and villages go under. With people across the globe dealing with the humanitarian and economic fallout of unusually heavy rains this year, are extreme weather events the new normal? Scientists, meteorologists and climate change experts blame rising global temperatures for the erratic weather patterns, leading to instances like heavy rains and floods. Heavy rainfall, cloudbursts, thunderstorms and heat waves are indeed becoming the new normal, said former India Meteorological Department (IMD) director general Laxman Singh Rathore. A worrying trend, added the consultant with the World Bank for South Asia on Climate Change, was that \u201cperiodicity and severity\u201d had increased. \u201cIn case of rainfall, the average precipitation has more or less remained the same, the dry spells have increased but the amount of rainfall remains the same. This means there is heavy concentration of rainfall over a particular region while other areas go dry,\u201d explained Jatin Singh, CEO of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency. IMD recorded 2016 as the hottest year since 1901. And, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report on climate change, observations since 1950 show changes in some extreme events, particularly daily temperature extremes and heat waves.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC report also noted that it is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in the 21st century over many regions. The numbers are alarming. According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 41 million people have been affected due to torrential rains in India, Nepal and Bangladesh this year. Nearly 900 people have died in the three countries, a report on the UN news website said.\u000a\u000aAn IMD report added that 1,600 people in India died due to extreme heatwave conditions which 475 lives were lost in floods and thunderstorms in 2016. Rathore said South Asian countries have been affected due to torrential rains and floods because of high population density. But how does global warming lead to heavy rainfall? Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist researching climate change with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, a premium institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, explained that the atmosphere and the oceans were getting warmer due to increasing carbon dioxide, a result of human activities.\u000a\u000a\u201cA warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. This results in two factors. The first is that warm moist air is lighter than cold dry air and hence makes the atmosphere unstable as it rises up,\u201d said Koll. The second factor, he added, is that since the atmosphere holds more moisture, it dumps it all together \u2014 a heavy rainfall event. These factors leads to erratic weather, including extreme rainfall events across the globe. There are domestic factors, too, that aggravate losses in times of extreme weather.\u000a\u000aFormer IMD DG Rathore pointed out that in case of cities, natural drainage systems have been \u201caltered\u201d at the cost of infrastructure development. One major reason for the 2005 Mumbai deluge, in which more than 500 people were killed with 944 mm of rain in a single day, was the damage done to natural drainage systems like the Mithi river. The river, which runs through the suburbs, has been revived to some extent now. Vineet Kumar, programme officer (Climate Change) with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said research on climate change and its effects was insufficient for exigency plans at the micro-level.\u000a\u000a\u201cDue to this, there is a huge gap in planning a policy to deal with the problems occurring due to climate change. For instance, there are not enough studies on the adverse impact on crops due to this phenomenon to come up with a policy on how to deal with it,\u201d Kumar said. As states like Bihar count their dead \u2014 an estimated 500 killed in the floods this year alone \u2014 and Mumbai gets back on its feet after the heavy rains yesterday, the hope is that next year will be different.

VWith water getting warmer, carbon dioxide level rising and bleaching events becoming more frequent, a team of Australian researchers has issued advice that more research is urgently required to determine whether corals can acclimatise and adapt to the rapid pace of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe researchers from ARC Centre of (Coral CoE) at James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) have recommended for future research.\u000a\u000aThese corals build the frameworks that provide shelter, food and habitat for an entire and if corals are lost, the diversity and abundance of other reef organisms declines, until ultimately the collapses.\u000a\u000aThey advised more research is urgently needed into the poorly-understood mechanisms that corals might use to survive in a rapidly warming world.\u000a\u000a"There is still a lot to understand about corals," said lead researcher Gergely Torda from James Cook University in Queensland,\u000a\u000a"While our only real chance for their survival is to reverse climate change, a nugget of hope exists - that the corals may be able to adapt to their changing environment," Torda added.\u000a\u000aCo-author Dr Jenni Donelson stated that the recent studies show that fish can acclimatise to higher water temperatures when several generations are exposed to the same increased temperature, but whether corals can do the same, and how they might achieve this, is largely unknown.\u000a\u000aThe team agrees that further research identifying how corals respond to climate change is critical, as the Earth undergoes an unprecedented rate of environmental change.\u000a\u000aAIMS Climate Change Scientist, Dr Line Bay said, "There is sufficient inertia in the climate system that we will not be able to prevent further climate-related disturbances affecting the reef in the immediate future."\u000a\u000a"Solutions are required to help corals adapt and acclimate to near-term future climate pressures while we figure out how to reduce emissions and halt and reverse longer-term climate change," Bay stated.\u000a\u000aThe researchers concluded that the time to act is now, as the window of opportunity to save is rapidly closing.\u000a\u000aThe research appears in journal Nature Climate Change.

VMumbai went under water last week; Chandigarh the week before, and Agartala, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad earlier on during this southwest monsoon. The jury is out on whether the extreme rain events were caused by climate change. But there is little doubt that detrimental land-use change played a big part in turning the rains to floods. Heavy, erratic and extreme rainfall is now unavoidable. But what are we doing to protect ourselves and make our cities less flood prone?\u000a\u000aExactly one year ago, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs submitted its report on the 2015 Chennai floods. The report concluded, among other things, that \u201cencroachment of lakes and river beds played a major role in causing massive flood in Chennai.\u201d Noting that the lessons from Chennai floods are \u201can eye-opener and other cities must also learn from it,\u201d the committee urged the state government to \u201ccheck mafia involved in illegal construction for business and usurping water bodies for their real estate business.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Tamil Nadu government has been quick to use the floods as an excuse to evict the poor from their dwellings on the margins of Chennai\u2019s stinking rivers. But, it has done nothing to check the \u201cmafia.\u201d The largest ongoing conversion of wetlands into real estate in Chennai is happening on the sprawling Ennore Creek to the north of the city.\u000a\u000aGoing by the popular meaning of mafia as an organised body of criminals, the Ennore Creek encroachers are not strictly mafia. The crime of encroaching, though, is being committed by an organised body of offenders led by state and central Public Sector Units, and facilitated by the very agencies that were set up to protect the environment.\u000a\u000aIn June 2017, Government of India-owned Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL) sought and obtained permission from the State Coastal Zone Management Authority to construct car parking terminals, coal yards and free trade warehouse zones by reclaiming several hundred acres of the Ennore Creek. This is in addition to 1,090 acres already diverted illegally to accommodate industrial installations belonging to central PSUs Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and a power plant and coal ash dump by NTECL, a centre-state joint venture involving NTPC Ltd and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO).\u000a\u000aKPL\u2019s proposal is pending clearance with the expert appraisal committee of the Union ministry of environment. NTECL\u2019s proposal to further expand its coal ash dump within the creek is pending with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. If cleared, the ensuing construction will not only damage the creek irretrievably but also expose 10 lakh people and critical infrastructure, including a petroleum refinery, to disastrous flooding.\u000a\u000aKosasthalaiyar, Chennai\u2019s lesser known river is also its biggest. Kosasthalaiyar exits to sea through the 8,000 acre backwaters of the Ennore Creek. The river\u2019s catchment is four times the combined drainage areas of Adyar and Cooum. Seen solely from a flood mitigation perspective, what Chennai does to the Kosasthalaiyar and the Ennore Creek will decide whether the city will survive or succumb with the next above-average rains.\u000a\u000aIn his submission to the parliamentary committee, former Union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi sought to defend the lapses of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in the lead-up to the floods by claiming that it is not possible to prepare for a once-in-a-century disaster. The same was echoed by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu Ms. Jayalalithaa who declared that \u201cswift rescue and relief alone are indicators of a good government.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth responses are intended to normalise a human-made disaster, and gloss over the pathology of urban development under successive administrations. The NDMA has effectively said that it will do nothing \u2013 like preventing the encroachment of wetlands by central government-owned entities -- to avert a disaster. In the case of the proposed encroachments by KPL in Ennore Creek, the governments of Tamil Nadu and India have been briefed of the risks and the illegalities.\u000a\u000aThe chief secretary, the State Disaster Management Authority, the environment secretary have all been approached to direct KPL to build its facilities on dry land instead of the river. None has acted. Worse, the Environment Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu actually recommended KPL\u2019s proposal to build inside the Ennore wetlands for clearance. Faced with a dilemma of whether to reduce flood risks for a million people or protect the commercial interests of KPL, the state government has stated its preference clearly.\u000a\u000aWhen the Kosasthalaiyar floods \u2013 and flood it will thanks to the encroachments -- and the lives of Chennai residents are imperilled, it should be remembered that those in power at the Centre and the state could have, but did nothing to avert certain disaster. Like the 2015 floods, the next Chennai floods too will be man-made.\u000a\u000aNityanand Jayaraman is a Chennai-based writer and social activist\u000a\u000aThe views expressed are personal

VVimal Mishra, meteorologist and assistant professor at IITGandhinagar, was part of a recent committee to investigate the floods at Dhanera in Gujarat. Heavy rains had lashed Gujarat and Rajasthan in July, and the normally quiet Rel river had overflown, causing havoc in the neighbouring areas.As part of a team investigating the impact of this flooding, Mishra looked at the statistics of rainfall and river flows, and compared them with historical figures. In two days, the region had got twice the seasonal total of rainfall, the water level in the river had exceeded 50 times the high water mark. \u201cI was shocked by the numbers,\u201d says Mishra.In his own research, Mishra along with his colleagues was investigating the correlation between extreme meteorological events and climate change . Four years ago, he found that the maximum rainfall was not showing an increase over the last century except in four of 57 towns and cities.In his later work, he showed that extremes are expected to increase over the current century. Specifically, he found that one-to-five-day extreme rains, at levels found once in about 500 years, can increase by about 20-30% over the next century if global warming goes unchecked.If Dhanera in Gujarat set new benchmarks for precipitation, then the role of climate change can\u2019t be ignored in the downpour that drowned Mumbai on August 30. If much of the disaster can be blamed on an inadequate drainage system, sustained changes in weather patterns may have only made it worse. In 24 hours, India\u2019s commercial capital was deluged by 331.4 mm of rain, which claimed lives, flooded roads and swamped railways. As the effects of climate change set in, this may become more commonplace in Mumbai and beyond.Raman Iyer, 80, a retired accountant, has witnessed three natural disasters in Mumbai and believes that as the city gets warmer (and safeguards like mangroves disappear), people will face more of them. \u201cWe thought the 1948 cyclone that hit the city was a once-in-lifetime event, then the flooding happened in 2005 and now this massive rainfall,\u201d he says. \u201cAreas that used to be wetlands and marshes are now glass-and-concrete business districts. The city will heat up and each disaster will be worse than the last.\u201dWith temperatures and emissions rising in India, climate change can cause havoc. \u201cOn a high emissions pathway, the probability of a once-in-a-century flood increases 1,000 times for a city like Kolkata in the latter half of this century,\u201d says Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a leading research outfit. \u201cThe probability of intense once-in-30-year floods in the Ganga basin could increase six fold \u2014 that is, it could become once in five years.\u201dSince July 26, 2005, when 944 mm of rain inundated Mumbai, causing unprecedented flooding and loss of lives, the risk of Indian cities from climate change \u2014 and inevitably, poor urban planning \u2014 has been laid bare. Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi have all weathered natural disasters over the past decade. They could only get worse. While India\u2019s urban decay may be triggering unmanageable flooding across the country, experts believe that climatic vagaries may only increase in frequency and intensity. And, the losses are beginning to mount. According to a recent report submitted by a parliamentary committee to the Ministry of Agriculture, climate change could cause damage of $9-10 billion annually from 2020 to the end of the century.Elsewhere, a study by Tamma Carleton, a researcher at UC Berkeley, said that as many as 59,000 Indian farmers committed suicide over the past three decades due to climate change. \u201cI find\u2026 no evidence that populations within India have been able to successfully adapt to a warming climate,\u201d she says. \u201cThe relationship between temperature and suicide is the same across different populations within India, and at different points in time, suggesting that even as India has gradually warmed while experiencing robust economic growth, people appear no better able to cope with high temperatures.\u201dWhile India may be aggressively chasing its climate change mitigation goals, effects of rising temperatures are beginning to tell on its cities, affecting nature, spreading diseases like dengue and disrupting agriculture. (See Deep Impact).Shweta Srinivasan, senior research analyst at the Centre for Science, Technology & Policy (CSTEP), points out that the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is India\u2019s commitment of tackling climate change in the medium term. \u201cIndia has made rather ambitious announcements\u2026. The 175 GW renewable energy and 40% fossil free electricity capacity target, which at the time of announcement looked difficult, seems much more realisable now,\u201d says Srinivasan. \u201cWe grew from 20 GW renewable energy capacity to 54 GW grid in three to four years. Now, scaling up is key.\u201d Institutional arrangements and uncertainty in terms of financing and project sustainability still need to be addressed.CEEW\u2019s Ghosh points out that while some of these effects may already be felt, the impact may not yet be pinned on climate change. \u201cClimate change is also taking a toll on human health. More than 22,500 deaths have been reported due to heatwaves between 1992 and 2015,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, this is an under-estimate as death reporting in the country needs to improve. We are experiencing more frequent outbreaks of climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue and malaria.\u201dGiven its large and growing population, increasing carbon dioxide emissions and rising temperatures, India may be precariously placed. According to the Climate Risk Index 2017 by Germanwatch, a nonprofit focused on climate, India was the fourth worst affected due to extreme climatic events in 2015. What\u2019s more, the country ranked No. 2 on the number of deaths due to extreme weather events, as per the same report. While the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that India is a relatively small contributor of CO2 emissions, globally agriculture contributes 24% of all greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s significant in the domestic context, since agriculture employs nearly half of India\u2019s working population and generates under a fifth of its GDP.Already, some organisations are beginning to push farmers in new directions to manage expected vagaries in rainfall and temperature across the country. For example, two hours from Hyderabad, in the arid districts of Mahbubnagar and Anantapur, D Ramachandrudu, director of Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (Wassan), has spent much of the past decade convincing farmers across 50 villages to rethink the way they source and use water. While government-funded watershed programmes help increase water levels, farmers nullify these gains by boring individual wells on their land to feed their crops.Wassan has been pushing farmers to network their borewells and change cropping patterns (from cash to food crops, for example and from water-intensive paddy to millet), to prepare for climate change. On the ground, farmers struggle to deal with uncertain gaps between rainfall (ranging from 20 days to 45 or even 60 days) and lean on artificial irrigation to bridge the gap.With rainfall forecast set to get more erratic with changing climatic patterns, farmers will be compelled to change hardwired habits even faster. \u201cIn this time of climate change, we want to give farmers more equitable access to water,\u201d says Ramachandrudu. \u201cWe have given them a timetable to ease the uncertainties they traditionally faced.\u201d While change may be afoot in agriculture, it may be needed elsewhere, too.\u201cThe aggressive focus on renewables, particularly solar, is right. But that\u2019s about all,\u201d says former Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh. \u201cDealing with climate change goes well beyond solar expansion. The growth trajectory in coal consumption needs a closer look. Forest protection and regeneration have to have an overriding priority.\u201d As India faces up to the widespread effects of climate change, some experts contend that ecological balance and sustainability have to underpin faster economic growth.Ghosh of CEEW says that from a mitigation perspective, India is aggressively pursuing its ambitious renewable energy targets. \u201cIndia\u2019s efforts to support clean energy imply that the share of coal in new capacity will decline compared with what it would have been in the absence of government\u2019s favourable push.\u201d However, with some 40 coal-fired power plants in the works across the country, it remains unclear how these will fit into this energy mix.While India has had an almost decade-long plan to combat climate change, measuring its efficiency remains questionable. \u201cIndia has a National Action Plan on Climate Change, which was released in 2008 and which outlines various missions for action on both mitigation and adaptation. State Action Plans have also been developed,\u201d says Suruchi Bhadwal, an analyst with The Energy Research Institute (TERI). \u201cSince there is no monitoring and evaluation framework, it is very difficult to judge the progress in this regard.\u201dOther missteps may also need to be corrected for India to mitigate risks from climate change. Consider, for example, the seeming diversion of the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund. Set up to fund climate change mitigation initiatives, a move to instead compensate states, following the implementation of GST, is expected to hamper progress on this front. \u201cThe fund could have been used to increase mitigation ambition, and in that sense, it has been a lost opportunity till now,\u201d says Ghosh of CEEW.Others such as Srinivasan of CSTEP contend that the government is mainly using the funds for land acquisition. \u201cA a robust financing architecture for renewables within the GST is required. One possible focus in the short term should be on improving institutional capacity and supporting utilities in buying RE-based power to make clean energy more competitive.\u201dWhile the flood waters receded after 24 hours around Mulund, the Mumbai neighbourhood in which Iyer, the retired accountant, has lived for five decades, he has a simplistic solution to solve Maximum City\u2019s ills. \u201cCancel all construction near mangroves and plant more trees,\u201d he says, supervising the last of the flood water being pumped out of his house. However,, beyond the concrete sprawl of Mumbai, much more needs to be done to deal with climate change.Experts say that India needs to consolidate its clean energy plans by piecing together a coherent long-term strategy to drive production and adoption of this form of power. \u201cMuch of the focus has been on the supply side. However, we also need to determine timebound targets for energy efficiency across end-use sectors, considering most of India\u2019s infrastructure has yet to be built,\u201d says Srinivasan of CSTEP. \u201cSeveral industries in the value chain need to be developed. These include solar cell manufacturing, energy storage devices and smart grid infrastructure.\u201dTo back this up, India needs to beef up its statelevel institutions to execute some of these plans and consider innovative business models (which drove down prices of LED bulbs, for example) to newer areas such as energy storage. As India comes to terms with climate change, it may need several structural shifts to make sure it is prepared for this.For one, a futures commission may help assess new patterns of economic development, drivers and disrupters of strategic and emerging technologies; apart from newer and more robust agreements for renewable energy; state guarantees to reduce counterparty risk, large land banks and innovative financial instruments. Finally, India will need to invest in wider climate risk assessment programmes to keep up with the latest trends in this area. (Climate) change is clearly in the air.A study published in the Journal of Climatology and Forecasting says that wheat yields are expected to decline by 5-10% with every 1C increase in temperature. Overall crop yields could decrease up to 30% in South Asia by the mid-21st century. India could experience a 40% decline in agricultural productivity by the 2080s. Another study, conducted by UC Berkeley Researcher Tamma Carelton and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, contends that 59,000 farmer suicides over the past 30 years can be linked to climate change.Rising temperatures can cause more frequent and more severe storms over Indian cities, whose infrastructure has failed to withstand even normal rainfall. More frequent storms, like those that swept Chennai, Mumbai, Bihar and Assam, are expected to hit the country. A single day of lost productivity in Mumbai costs Rs 5,000-6,000 crore. According to a paper by Anup Kanth and Diane Archer from The International Institute for Environment and Development, London, climate change will result in temperature rising by 2-4C, an increase of 7\u201320% in annual precipitation with riverine flooding, cyclones, storm surges and rising sea level.According to a report coauthored by Kristie L Ebi and Joshua Nealon, of the departments of global health and environmental and occupational health sciences, University of Washington, and Sanofi Pasteur\u2019s Asia Pacific epidemiology, respectively, the incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold in the past 50 years, with the disease spreading to higher latitudes (the vector mosquito typically doesn\u2019t survive sub 15 degree C), as temperatures rise.According to researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, erratic rainfall and rising temperatures are beginning to change the Western Ghats, an ecological hotbed of flora and fauna. As per one report, dense forests with native species have decreased by 2.84%, 4.38% and 5.77% in the northern, central and southern Western Ghats respectively.The Indira Gandhi canal, Rajasthan, has the largest water diversion project in the country. It has played a big role in greening parts of the Thar desert, but it may have had an impact on the climate of the state as well. In recent years, the monsoon has been increasing in intensity in Rajasthan, and some climatologists suspect that diversion of water and large-scale pumping of groundwater are reasons for this. As the earth warms up, India will be one of the hardest hit, as it is in a vulnerable climatic zone. Increasing carbon dioxide is not the only worry for India. Says J Srinivasan, distinguished scientist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc: \u201cLocal effects of climate change are more important for a region than global effects.\u201dNo climatologist will make a direct connection between a local event like diversion of water and rainfall over that region, but they are certain that regional changes can have long-term consequences. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change specifies that global effects cannot be measured for areas less than 1 million sq km. What happens over Bengaluru or Mumbai, or Delhi cannot be attributed to increases in carbon dioxide. What we do in these cities have more impact than what the US or China does. Recent research substantiates this.In pic: The Indira Gandhi CanalSubimal Ghosh, associate professor of civil engineering at IIT-Bombay, studied the effect of changing land use patterns over north and northeast India, and the effect of these changes on the monsoon. He found that forests in this region contributed significantly towards rainfall through recycled precipitation. Thick vegetation holds moisture well, this evaporates and comes back as rain. Large amounts of trees have been cut in these region to make way for crops, and there is reason to suppose that this change can affect rainfall over the region.Ghosh studied satellite images and rainfall data, and analysed the correlations. He found that large-scale deforestation is responsible for the declining rainfall around the Gangetic plain and northeast India, and parts of central India. The effect is most pronounced over northeast India. Says Ghosh: \u201cRecycled precipitation is 20-25% of the rain during August and September.\u201d This reduction in recycled moisture is seen to be responsible for early withdrawal of the monsoon over north and northeast India.Similarly, studies have shown an increase in heavy rainfall over cities. \u201cCities are not just concrete,\u201d says Dev Niyogi, professor of agronomy at Purdue University. \u201cThey also have transport and air conditioning and other things.\u201d They store heat during the day and release it at night, creating an urban heat island and making cities hotter by about 3-5 degree Celsius than surrounding areas. \u2014 Hari Pulakkat(Additional reporting by Hari Pulakkat and G Seetharaman)

VEminent water activist has urged the Centre to take up cleaning of rivers on a priority basis and emphasised on the need to educate the present generation about the importance of water bodies.\u000a\u000aThe Ramon Magsaysay Award winning campaigner was speaking at an international conference, where speakers also called for a ban on building hotels and houses within 1 km radius of the river banks in the country.\u000a\u000aThe speakers said the Centre should take up steps to improve quality of crops and increase the agriculture productivity yield.\u000a\u000aThe conference, organised by Govardhan Eco Village, set up by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Wada taluka near here, urged the state industrial development corporations to construct special dams for industries and demanded a ban on hotels, tourism activity and housing development within 1 km radius of the river banks.\u000a\u000aAcademicians, policy-makers, scientists and NGOs from and abroad took part in the two-day seminar on "Climate Change Adoption for Sustainable Development", held on August 27 and 28.\u000a\u000aThe participants harped on the need to ban hazardous fishing activities and prevent discharge of harmful effluents and town sewage of solid waste into the rivers.\u000a\u000aSingh, popularly known as the 'Waterman of India', and Spiritual leader Radhanath Swami Maharaj, noted that rivers were the lifeline of the country and there was an urgent need to protect them.\u000a\u000aNo intervention in the name of development should obstruct, pollute, erode or result in adverse impact on ecology and bio-diversity, they said.\u000a\u000aBoth the speakers said modern technology should be used for desilting of rivers and dams.\u000a\u000aThe conference, attended by 120 delegates, demanded that all civic bodies in cities, where water is taken from rivers and other natural resources, implement conservation plan, prevent leakages and recycle water in hotels, residential societies and other places.\u000a\u000aThe speakers said maximum use of solar energy should be encouraged to reduce pollution caused by coal-based plants.\u000a\u000aInaugurating the meet, ISKCON's Swami maintained that the vedic perspective teaches people about dealing with climate change and taking care of the mother earth.\u000a\u000aSingh (67) spoke about how the vedic approach towards environmental crises were about traditional, localised adaption of techniques which were not only decentralised but also cost-effective. They were unlike the modern mitigation techniques which were complicated and cost prohibitive.\u000a\u000aThe Rajasthan-based activist, who has won the prestigious Stockholm Water Prize (also called "the Nobel Prize for water"), called for launching a movement to educate the present generation about climate change and water conservation.\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VFor the second time in a little more than a decade, rain and floods brought Mumbai, India\u2019s commercial capital, to a grinding halt. The city recorded nearly 300 mm of rain on August 29, one of the heaviest spells in the city\u2019s history. It was much lower than the all time single-day record of 944 mm of July 2005, but it was enough to bring the city to its knees.\u000a\u000aThe media reported on the impact on citizens, the failure of the local administration to first anticipate and then deal with the situation. While this remained focused primarily on the causes of flooding, there was another series of reports on larger phenomenon at play: Global warming and changing land use in the city. This makes a deadly combination indeed.\u000a\u000aThe coastal landscape of Mumbai has changed drastically in the last few years \u2014 satellite imagery following the August deluge shows, for instance, how mangrove forests in areas like Thane, Malad, and the Manori creek, have been lost or encroached upon. The new airport that was approved in Navi Mumbai a few years ago will destroy nearly 160 hectares of mangroves. The initial proposals by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority had suggested the reclamation of more than 20 sq.km. of the city\u2019s salt pans for housing and other projects. The desire for more land is clearly jettisoning the security of the city and this is only expected to grow more pronounced as weather patterns become more extreme and also more uncertain with climate change.\u000a\u000aCapacity to cope\u000a\u000aThere are two threads of discussion that are relevant here. On the positive side is the realisation, at least to an extent, of the importance of ecosystems like the mangrove. This is reflected in the creation in Maharashtra of a mangrove cell to protect and regenerate mangroves. Mumbai has some very good patches of mangroves, two of which (in Vikhroli and Airoli in Navi Mumbai) were included in a list of 12 important mangrove systems in India recently released by the Mangrove Society of India. While protection of the mangroves is unlikely to completely prevent the kind of events Mumbai has seen recently, the move will certainly help ensure a better capacity to cope. A 2009 study by scientists at the University of Delhi and Duke University in the United States showed, for instance, that villages with wider mangrove belts suffered relatively lesser damage during the 1999 \u2018super cyclone\u2019 that ravaged the Odisha coast and killed an estimated 10,000 people.\u000a\u000aA study published in May 2017 in the journal Hydrobiologia, pointed out that in the U.S., wetland coastal protection services provide an estimated $23.2 billion per year against economic losses as well as deaths associated with major storm events.\u000a\u000aHuge challenges\u000a\u000aThe bigger challenge in India comes however from the overarching thrust given to industrial expansion and infrastructure development.\u000a\u000aThis is starkly visible in the NITI Aayog\u2019s recently-released \u2018Three year action agenda 2017-18 to 2019-20\u2019. While the action agenda for coastal regions does list issues surrounding coastal zone management and regions vulnerable to cyclones, flooding, earthquakes and tsunamis, these are included only as broad generalities. The major thrust, clearly, is on exploiting the land and the resources along the coasts for aggressive economic growth, suggesting as it does port development as part of the Sagarmala programme, easing of sea-river movement, a massive thrust to tourism develo pment, creation of a 2500 km long East Coast Economic corridor running from Visakhapatnam to Chennai, and the creation of 14 Coastal Employment zones based on the Chinese model of Special Economic Zones.\u000a\u000aConservation and protection are clearly not a priority \u2014 and this is a matter of serious concern, not just for Mumbai but for regions all along India\u2019s coastline. The NITI Aayog report itself notes that nearly 250 million people in the country live within 50 km of the coastline. And no amount of infrastructure development or economic growth will ensure their protection as the case of Mumbai has shown not once, but twice in little more than a decade.\u000a\u000aThe writer researches issues at the intersection of environment, science, society, and technology.

VCompetitive cousinsBristlecone pine trees standing with young limber pines growing around them in the White Mountains in east of Bishop, Calif.PHOTO: APBrian Smithers\u000a\u000aThe bristlecone pine tree, famous for its wind-beaten, gnarly limbs and having the longest lifespan on Earth, is losing a race to the top of mountains throughout the Western United States, putting future generations in peril, researchers said.\u000a\u000aDriven by climate change, a cousin of the tree, the limber pine, is leapfrogging up mountainsides, taking root in warmer, more favorable temperatures and leaving little room for the late-coming bristlecone, a study finds.\u000a\u000aResearchers compare the competing tree species to a pair of old men in a slow-motion race up a mountainside taking thousands of years, and climate change is the starting gun.\u000a\u000a\u201cLimber pine is taking all the good spots,\u201d said Brian Smithers, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Davis, who led the research. \u201cIt\u2019s jarring.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe bristlecone pine can live 5,000 years, making it the oldest individually growing organism on the planet, researchers say.\u000a\u000aForests of the diminutive bristlecone pines are found in eastern California, Nevada and Utah. They thrive in desolate limestone soil that is inhospitable to most trees. They grow at high elevation, hammered by wind and extreme temperatures.\u000a\u000aThe punishing conditions give shape to their twisted limbs. To survive long dry spells, parts of the tree dies and sheds its bark appearing dead, except for small spouts of green pine needles, signaling life, researchers say.\u000a\u000aAmong the oldest and most famous is Methuselah standing in the White Mountains of eastern California. It remains unmarked among its grove, so vandals cannot find it.\u000a\u000aThe bristlecone pine\u2019s distant relative, the limber pine is also a hearty survivalist, living 2,000 years. Researchers say they found that the limber pine, which typically grows at lower elevations, has begun to \u201cleapfrog\u201d past the bristlecone.\u000a\u000aThe three-year study involved counting the trees newly sprouting within the last 50 years above the historical tree line. Most of those growing at the higher elevation are limber pine, researchers said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s very odd to see it charging upslope and not see bristlecone charging upslope ahead of the limber pine,\u201d Smithers said. \u201cOr at least with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aSmithers said he could not estimate how many bristlecone pine trees exist throughout the Western U.S. They are not at risk of extinction, but they could be crowded out in some places they\u2019ve grown for thousands of years.\u000a\u000aThis research on climate change\u2019s impact on these two species of trees can be used to understand more complex forests with several types of trees harvested for timber, Smithers said.AP\u000a\u000aFact file:\u000a\u000aThe bristlecone pine is the oldest individually growing organism on the planet\u000a\u000aIt can live for nearly 5000 years\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s found in eastern California, Nevada and Utah

VThousands of Pacific walrus are coming to Alaska\u2019s northwest shore again in the absence of summer sea ice and not all are surviving.\u000a\u000aA recent survey of a mile of coastline near the Inupiaq Eskimo village of Point Lay found 64 dead walruses, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told The Associated Press .\u000a\u000aMost of the animals were younger than a year old. The cause of death is not known, said agency spokeswoman Andrea Medeiros, but stampedes set off when startled walruses rush to the sea, crushing smaller animals are a likely suspect.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur thinking is, because of the age of the animals, they were young animals, it\u2019s likely that it was caused by a stampede, probably more likely than disease, given the age class,\u201d Medeiros said.\u000a\u000aA polar bear, hunter, airplane or boat can cause a stampede. Alaska native residents of Point Lay, who may legally hunt walrus for food, expressed concern after seeing an airplane flying near the herd and possibly circling.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat certainly is a concern,\u201d Medeiros said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we want people to be doing.\u201d\u000a\u000aFish and Wildlife Service guidelines instruct pilots of single-engine planes to stay at least a half-mile away from walruses on land or ice, and if closer, to fly above 2,000 feet.\u000a\u000aThe guidelines call for helicopters and multi-engine aircraft to stay a mile away, or if closer, above 3,000 feet. The agency warns that it is only guidance but creating a disturbance is a violation of federal law.\u000a\u000aSeveral hundred walruses came ashore near Point Lay on August 3, the earliest recorded appearance of a herd in a phenomenon tied to climate warming and diminished Arctic Ocean sea ice.\u000a\u000aA week later, the number had grown to 2,000. In the past month, 30,000 to 40,000 walruses at times have crowded the beach, Medeiros said.\u000a\u000aResidents of Point Lay reported three to five dead walruses in early August. A community member who works with the Fish and Wildlife Service counted 64 dead walruses earlier this week and tagged them so they would not be counted in a later survey.\u000a\u000aShaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who wrote the 2008 petition to list walruses as threatened or endangered species, said the Fish and Wildlife Service should review guidelines for protecting walruses.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese animals are suffering a great deal of stress from climate change, and when they\u2019re pushed ashore, they should get very strong protections from disturbances,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe ultimate threat to walruses is the rapid loss of sea ice due to climate disruption, she said, adding that rollbacks of climate change protections by the Trump administration will further endanger the animals.AP\u000a\u000aHAZARDING A GUESS\u000a\u000aBecause of the age of the animals (younger than a year), it\u2019s likely that it was caused by a stampede, probably more likely than disease.\u000a\u000aA polar bear, hunter, airplane or even a boat can cause a stampede. Alaska native residents expressed concern after seeing an airplane flying near the herd and possibly circling.\u000a\u000aHistorically, sea ice has provided a platform for rest and safety far from predators for mothers and calves north of the Bering Strait. But now, instead of staying on sea ice over the deep water, walruses have gathered on shore to rest.\u000a\u000aCalves born earlier this year are especially vulnerable when shoulder to shoulder with mature females that weigh more than a ton.\u000a\u000aThese animals are suffering a great deal of stress from climate change, and when they\u2019re pushed ashore, they should get very strong protections from disturbances.\u000a\u000aShaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

VHarsh Vardhan also urged all stakeholders, including the industry and the consumers, to move towards more environment friendly cooling agents. Photo: Mint\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: Lessons taught by ancestors on conserving the environment have been forgotten and global warming \u201cis a message from God\u201d for course correction, Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday.\u000a\u000aVardhan said various international agreements on environment and climate change will not show results unless work in carried out at the ground level. He, however, lauded the international community for coming together to address the problem of global warming that threatens the world.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur ancestors handed over to us clean rivers, rich fertile land, pure air, forest. But in the process of improving our lives, we did things that led to degradation of environment. This is why God has sent us a message under the name of global warming and climate change,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aVardhan was speaking at an event organised on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol.\u000a\u000aThe Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion.\u000a\u000aThe minister also urged all stakeholders, including the industry and the consumers, to move towards more environment friendly cooling agents used in refrigerators and air- conditioners. Citing the Montreal Protocol, Vardhan said such treaties under the aegis of the United Nations (UN) have helped achieve many important milestones to conserve the environment.\u000a\u000aThe minister also spoke of the strong policy leadership given by India during the negotiations for the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Under the amendment, three different schedules have been set for countries to freeze and then reduce the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).\u000a\u000aThe developed countries, led by the US and Europe, will reduce HFC use by 85% by 2036 over a 2011-13 baseline China, which is the largest producer of HFCs in the world, will reduce HFC use by 80% by 2045 over the 2020-22 baseline. India will reduce the use of HFCs by 85% over the 2024-26 baseline.

VCheyenne: Handing a major victory to environmentalists, a court cast doubt Friday on a longstanding U.S. government argument that blocking federal coal leasing won't affect climate change because the coal could simply be mined elsewhere.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists have been trying for years to block federal coal leases on climate-change grounds with limited success. The ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will require the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to provide more data to support its argument that coal makes no net contribution to climate change after it's burned in power plants. The BLM oversees leasing of vast Western tracts that supply much of the nation's coal.\u000a\u000a"This is big. And we're certainly going to be wielding this and using it to confront other mining approvals both in the Powder River Basin and beyond," said Jeremy Nichols with WildEarth Guardians.\u000a\u000aThe Sierra Club and WildEarth Guardians sued to block four leases that would allow mining to continue at the Black Thunder and North Antelope Rochelle mine, the two biggest in the U.S. by production. Both are in the Powder River Basin, where vast, open-pit mines supply around 40 percent of the nation's coal.\u000a\u000aIn analyzing the leases, the BLM found that burning the coal deposits would result in 382 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, or about 6 percent of the U.S. total in 2008.\u000a\u000aBut the BLM argued that because utilities could simply get their coal from mines that don't lease federal deposits, blocking the leases would have no net effect on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe appeals court wasn't persuaded, ruling that the BLM didn't provide sufficient data to back up that argument. It told a lower court to seek more analysis from the agency.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, mining will continue at three of the contested leases the BLM sold to Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, the St. Louis-based companies that own the two mines. A fourth contested lease near Black Thunder hasn't sold yet.\u000a\u000aBLM officials didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a staunch supporter of the coal industry, said he was disappointed in the ruling but pleased that mining could continue.\u000a\u000aWyoming Mining Association Director Travis Deti also called the ruling disappointing.\u000a\u000aWyoming's coal industry has rebounded somewhat since competition from cheaper natural gas made 2016 its worst year in decades. Around 500 miners were laid off in the state's coal patch, and the state continues to face an inability to build new schools, which are funded by coal leasing.\u000a\u000a"Wyoming can continue to cling to the past or get out ahead of these changes by producing the clean power that consumers are demanding," said Sierra Club Wyoming Director Connie Wilbert in a release.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe government is preparing the ground for public consultation on developing a climate adaptation and mitigation strategy for the State.\u000a\u000aThe steering committee on climate change, chaired by the chief secretary, has cleared a proposal to revise the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC). Officials said the revision process had been set in motion, with the focus on reassessing the vulnerable sectors. The Department of Environment and Climate Change (DoECC) is carrying out the exercise with the assistance of the Institute of Climate Change Studies (ICCS) and other agencies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe draft plan is expected to be ready by the year end. It will form the base document for public consultation on formulating the appropriate response,\u201d says Dr. George Chackacherry, Director, ICCS.\u000a\u000aA consultative workshop and sectoral-level discussions have already been held with various departments and agencies and efforts are on to update the facts and figures in the original document.\u000a\u000aThe current SAPCC that was approved by the Centre in 2015 envisages a budget requirement of \u20b91,170 crore for projects to mitigate the impact of climate change in Kerala.\u000a\u000aThe five-year project had identified eight key sectors for intervention, namely agriculture and animal husbandry, fisheries and coastal ecosystems, forests and biodiversity, water resources, health, energy, urban front and transport and tourism.\u000a\u000aThe plan had listed Alappuzha, Palakkad, Wayanad and Idukki as climate change hotspots with a high degree of vulnerability of natural hazards like drought and floods, impacting on biodiversity and human life.\u000a\u000aThe plan, however, remained bogged down due to the lack of coordination between departments. The SAPCC had also come in for criticism from civil society organisations and stakeholder communities who felt that the absence of public consultation reflected a bureaucratic approach to tackling climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe revision process will follow a participatory approach. We have planned a series of discussions with civil society organisations and representatives of various communities,\u201d says Dr. Chackacherry.\u000a\u000aThere are indications that the vulnerable sectors would be re examined to reflect the emerging threats posed by climate change. Reliable sources said the climate change hotspots were likely to be determined for each sector.

VDespite the Narendra Modi government\u2019s claims of being committed to the Paris Climate Agreement, India registered one of the largest increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2016, in contrast to the other major emitters, which either saw decreases or stable emissions.\u000a\u000aIndia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions rose by an alarming 4.7% in 2016, compared to the previous year, the report released by Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency on Thursday, said. The US saw a decline of 2% and even China reported a decrease of 0.3%.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that global carbon dioxide emissions, which is the primary greenhouse gas, have remained flat in the past two years registering only marginal increases.\u000a\u000aThe report attributed the downward trend to falling coal consumption and a shift towards cleaner fuels. India, however, bucked this trend as well, with coal consumption rising by 4% in 2016.\u000a\u000aBy 2030, India has vowed to reduce its emissions intensity by 35% of 2005 levels and spectacularly expand its renewable energy capacity. The nation aims to have 100 GW of installed solar capacity by 2022. The National Electricity Plan released in 2016 said that 56.5% of India\u2019s installed power capacity will be from renewables within the 10 years to 2027. Currently, the coal and other fossil fuels meet about 70% of India\u2019s power demand.\u000a\u000aGreenhouse gases include not just carbon dioxide but also methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, which constitute 28% of all GHG emissions, and in India contribute to over 30%.\u000a\u000aIncrease in these gases was one of the major causes for GHG rising in India. Methane is the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas. The biggest emitter of methane is cattle, which contribute to almost a quarter of global methane emissions.\u000a\u000aIndia has the largest number of cattle in the world, with around 300 million of them. Cattle farts and belches contain methane.Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, causing more warming over the long term.\u000a\u000aThe top emitters of GHG remain China (26%), U.S. (13%), India (7%).

VClimate change is serious challenge for a country like India where about 50% of the population directly or indirectly depends on agriculture for a livelihood. Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint\u000a\u000aThe farm sector in India is in distress and several state governments have responded with loan waivers, which could affect their fiscal math and the ability to push capital expenditure at a time when the Indian economy has slowed significantly. This comes after India faced deficient rainfall for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015. According to estimates, production of kharif crops in the current year is expected to decline by 2.8% because of an uneven monsoon. The possibility of such weather events is likely to increase in the future. And that means a serious challenge for a country like India where about 50% of the population directly or indirectly depends on agriculture for a livelihood.\u000a\u000aAn analytical chapter from the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), released on Wednesday, highlights some of the damaging macroeconomic impact of weather shocks, particularly for low-income countries. The IMF notes that for the median emerging market economy, growth goes down by 0.9 percentage point in the same year because of a 1-degree Celsius increase from a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. The impact on the median low-income developing country is even higher. What is worse is that the output doesn\u2019t recover quickly after a weather shock. Even after seven years, the per capita output is lower by 1% and 1.5%, respectively, for the median emerging market and the median low-income country.\u000a\u000aWeather does not affect the agriculture sector alone, it affects productivity in general. Research shows that productivity starts declining strongly after peaking at an average annual temperature of about 13 degrees Celsius. Therefore, countries located in areas with higher temperature will face a disproportionate impact of global warming. Loss of output and lower productivity also affects capital formation, which has a bearing on medium- to long-term growth prospects.\u000a\u000aThe necessary steps to minimize the impact of climate change will have to be taken at both the individual country level and the global level. In order to reduce the impact of changing weather patterns, emerging market and low-income economies will have to build significant macroeconomic resilience.\u000a\u000aThe IMF, for example, notes: \u201cThe results suggest that having the right policies and institutions in place may help attenuate the effects of temperature shocks, to some extent. The instantaneous effect of a temperature shock is slightly smaller in countries with lower public debt, higher inflows of foreign aid, and greater exchange rate flexibility.\u201d India is relatively better off in this context, but it needs to preserve and further strengthen macroeconomic stability to be able to deal with such shocks.\u000a\u000aOver the years, India has done well to reduce its dependence on the monsoon, which is evident from the fact that two successive years of drought did not result in runaway inflation. However, more needs to be done to enhance productivity in the agriculture sector. Financial losses can be reduced by higher penetration of insurance products.\u000a\u000aFurther, India can work on programmes that will help improve the quality of land and reduce the risk of climate change. In Ethiopia, for example, food and cash is provided to the poor who participate in local environmental programmes. This has resulted in reduction in soil loss and has increased the availability of water. India can perhaps use employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in a better way to enhance soil and water conservation. India also needs to strengthen its overall capability by investing in and adopting technology as the impact of climate change is not limited to agriculture. For instance, better use of technology can reduce energy consumption for air conditioning. A district cooling system is being constructed in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City. It will be interesting to see if this can be adopted in other cities as well.\u000a\u000aAt the global level, a consensus was attained under the Paris Agreement to contain the rise in global temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius from the pre industrial levels. Advanced countries have also committed to provide financial assistance to developing countries to help cope with the impact of climate change. However, things are not moving as desired. The Donald Trump administration in the US is not keen on continuing with the Paris Agreement. This will damage the project substantially and a renegotiation will only increase uncertainty. It is also being reported that advanced economies may not meet their commitment of reducing emissions. The lack of will among industrialized economies to contain emissions is disappointing, and it could lead to consequences that go beyond the realm of macroeconomics. India would do well to prepare for the challenge.\u000a\u000aHow can India reduce the impact of global warming? Tell us at views@livemint.com

VParis: Emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from livestock are larger than previously thought, posing an additional challenge in the fight to curb global warming, scientists said Friday.\u000a\u000aRevised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle show that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11 percent higher than estimates based on data from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.\u000a\u000aPeriodic reports by the IPCC, drawing from thousands of scientists, help leaders take action on climate change, which has begun to wreak weather havoc around the globe.\u000a\u000a"In many regions, livestock numbers are changing, and breeding has resulted in larger animals with higher intakes of food," said Julie Wolf, a researcher in the US Department of Agriculture and lead author of a study in the journal Carbon Balance and Management.\u000a\u000a"This, along with changes in livestock management, can lead to higher methane emissions."\u000a\u000aEarlier estimates, she added in a statement, were based on "out-of-date data".\u000a\u000aAfter rising slowly from 2000 to 2006, the concentration of methane in the air has climbed 10 times more quickly in the last decade, according to earlier research.\u000a\u000aBesides natural sources such as peatland, wetlands and termites, methane from human activity -- approximately two-thirds of the total -- is produced in two ways.\u000a\u000aThe odourless and colourless gas leaks during the production and transport of coal, oil and especially natural gas.\u000a\u000aIn roughly equal measure, it also comes from the flatulence of ruminants such as cattle and sheep, as well as the decay of organic waste, notably in landfills.\u000a\u000a- 'Hidden climate change cost' -\u000a\u000aMethane accounted for about 16 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the IPCC.\u000a\u000aCarbon dioxide -- produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels -- accounts for more than three-quarters of planet-warming emissions.\u000a\u000a"As our diets become more meat and dairy-rich, so the hidden climate cost of our food tends to mount up," said University of Edinburgh professor Dave Reay, reacting to the study.\u000a\u000a"Cows belching less methane may not be as eye-catching as wind turbines and solar panels, but they are just as vital for addressing climate change."\u000a\u000aThe new study boosts the "estimate of human-induced emissions of methane from all sources by about four percent," said University of Leeds professor Piers Forster, who was not involved in the research.\u000a\u000aMethane is far more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, capturing more of the Sun's radiative force. But it persists for less time in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aTaking that into account, scientists calculate that over a 100-year period the "global warming potential" of the gas is 28 times greater than for carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aThe study noted that methane emissions from livestock have risen most sharply in the rapidly developing regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, the increase has slowed sharply in the United States and Canada. In Europe, emissions of the gas have declined.\u000a\u000aA sharp rise in methane pollution could jeopardise the goal -- enshrined in the 196-nation Paris climate pact -- of capping global warming below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a consortium of 81 scientists warned in December.\u000a\u000a"Such a target will become increasingly difficult if reductions in methane emissions are not also addressed strongly and rapidly," they wrote in an open letter.

VLong thought to be a carbon sink, the world's tropical forests now release more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere than they remove from it, thanks to their continued deforestation and degradation, warns a new study.\u000a\u000aThe study published in the journal Science, analysed the carbon density of woody live vegetation across tropical America, Africa and Asia for the period 2003 to 2014.\u000a\u000aThe researchers combined a comprehensive array of data, including carbon estimates from NASA, satellite imagery and field measurements.\u000a\u000aThe findings showed that carbon losses exceed gains on every continent, with the greatest losses, 60 per cent, occurring in the American tropics.\u000a\u000a"The losses due to deforestation and degradation are actually emitting more CO2 to the atmosphere, compared with how much the existing forest is able to absorb," the lead author of the study Alessandro Baccini of Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts was quoted as saying by the Washington Post.\u000a\u000aFor the carbon loss that did occur, the majority was due to deforestation and degradation, particularly in tropical America and Africa, the study said.\u000a\u000aThe findings point to an urgent need to stop degradation of the world's tropical forests.\u000a\u000aRemarkably, the authors found trends between local policies and carbon abundance.\u000a\u000aFor example in Brazil, decreasing losses in carbon density are evident during the early period of the study, which the authors attribute to retractions in soy and cattle production, increases in monitoring and enforcement together with fines and embargos on illegal deforestation, and the creation of new protected areas.\u000a\u000a--IANS\u000a\u000agb/bg\u000a\u000a(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

VPune: Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) revealed majority of monsoons over the past 18 years had been below average like 2017, which ended on a below average note at -5% departure.From 2000, the country has seen as many as 12 monsoons with less rain than the long period average, more so from 2014 to 2017\u2014 a period marked by consecutive monsoons ending on a negative note.According to IMD, a monsoon season is \u201cnormal\u201d when the total rainfall in the country from June to September is within 10% (plus or minus) of the average rain over the long period. Monsoon 2017 for India recently ended with a total rainfall of 841.3mm \u2014 5% less than the average.The rainfall data from 2000 showed despite monsoon being \u201cnormal\u201d in 14 years as per IMD norms, eight of them ended with \u201cnegative rain\u201d or less rainfall than the long period average.A K Sahai, the head of climate research and services at IMD, Pune, told TOI that below-normal or above-normal monsoon seemed to have an epochal periodicity. \u201cThe monsoon rainfall data spanning over the past 100 years or so shows that some 30-year or 40-year period has been marked by positive monsoon rainfall departures while some others had years with below-average rain,\u201d said Sahai.He said the current epoch had more of below-average monsoon seasons. \u201cAccording to the periodicity, above-average monsoon period should have started by now, but there seems to have been a slight delay in that,\u201d said Sahai.Experts stressed there was a possibility of monsoon weakening due to the impact of the climate change, but this was something that researchers were unclear about.\u201cThere is still no clarity on whether the monsoon will intensify or weaken due to the impact of the climate change. One thing is clear that extreme rainfall events may increase due to the climate change, which may reduce the number of rainy days in India,\u201d said Sahai.A K Srivastava, the head of IMD\u2019s climate monitoring and analysis group, Pune, said, \u201cThe current epoch \u2014 from 1991 to 2020 \u2014 has shown a trend of negative or low rainfall. Past statistics show the epochal behaviour of monsoon, but how long will this rainall trend continues beyond the year 2020 cannot be gauged.\u201d

VOnly one out of four river basins in India can support vegetation during a drought year, posing a threat to the country\u2019s agricultural productivity and food security, a first-of-its-kind study has revealed.\u000a\u000aA two-member team from the Indian Institute of Technology \u2014 Guwahati (IIT-G) prepared an ecosystem resilience map of India from 2000 to 2014 to find that only six of the 22 river basins can support crop yield and vegetation during a drought. This means as much as two-third of the country\u2019s vegetation \u2014 including crop land, forests, grasslands and shrub lands \u2014 is not resilient.\u000a\u000aA resilient ecosystem can absorb hydro-climatic disturbances, such as a drought, by increasing or maintaining its efficiency to use water to help sustain its productivity.\u000a\u000aThe findings assume importance since previous studies have reported an increase in the intensity and frequency of droughts in India. A 2015 study found that droughts have shifted towards the Indo-Gangetic area, central Maharashtra and coastal south-India plains that are important for agriculture.\u000a\u000aOf all the land-based vegetation, crop lands cover about 50% of the total geographical area, and are therefore the most dominant in India. Geographically, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan, Gujarat, and parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Odisha are most vulnerable to drought.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the context of climate change, droughts have become recurring events. With a population of 1.2 billion that needs to be fed, it is important to know which ecosystem is resilient. If the vegetation around the river basin is not resilient, crop production will get severely affected,\u201d said lead investigator Manish Kumar Goyal, also assistant professor, department of civil engineering, IITG.\u000a\u000a\u201cA national water policy does not serve any purpose as some areas have surplus water and others are water deficient. There is a need to have a local strategy, as opposed to a regional or national policy, to address these challenges. Developing local water management practises and drought-resilient crops could be among the solutions,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThe Ganga basin \u2014 the largest in terms of its geographical area and most the populous since it runs through 11 states \u2014 was found to be non-resilient along with basins along the Western Ghats, and India\u2019s central and eastern regions. The Mahi river basin that covers Rajasthan, Gujarat and MP \u2014 is the most non-resilient.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne-third of the population lives in the Ganga river basin, and a non-resilient ecosystem will not be able to withstand droughts, which are expected to increase multifold in terms of intensity, severity and frequency,\u201d said Goyal. \u201cConcrete steps need to be taken in terms of formulating and implementing policies at local level,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aDespite the high annual rainfall and water surplus, river basins along the Western Ghats are unable to maintain their efficiency to use water during a drought year.\u000a\u000aOf the seven land cover types studied, as many as five \u2014 cropland, a mix of cropland and natural vegetation, grasslands, mixed forest and deciduous broadleaf forest \u2014 are not resilient. Only evergreen needle leaf and evergreen broadleaf forests can withstand a drought.\u000a\u000aThe Indus river basin was the most resilient, followed by Brahmaputra, three basins along coastal south India and one located in arid and semi-arid drought-affected regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat.\u000a\u000aWith 60% forest cover, the Brahmaputra basin that runs through Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, West Bengal and Sikkim is highly resilient.\u000a\u000a\u201cForest cover is the most important parameter for ecosystem resilience, and the Brahmaputra basin and Western Ghats can withstand the challenges of climate change that will affect agriculture and water security in the other basins,\u201d said Goyal. \u201cDevelopment needs deforestation, but there should not be continuous deforestation. It should be minimal and within the purview of the ecosystem, so there is no adverse effect on crop production,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, ecosystems in arid regions are habituated to the limited water conditions owing to frequent droughts and are hence resilient. The study is published in Global Change Biology, a high impact factor Wiley journal.

VHYDERABAD: The Telangana government and GHMC must adopt the Surat model to build a resilient city given an increase in erratic rainfall leading to flooding of colonies . This was suggested by urban studies experts at the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), who are also pushing for separate town planning and building permission rules for low-lying and flood-prone areas .Surat has floated a publicprivate trust, headed by a chief resilient officer, to coordinate with various wings of the municipal corporation regarding flooding and water management. \u201cAlmost all Indian cities are witnessing urban flooding due to high intensity rainfall in short periods. Governments need to start building resilient cities that can withstand the shocks of climate change. Like seismic zones , cities should mark flooding zones and building rules should be changed accordingly. Rain water harvesting should also be taken up on a big scale. The Surat model can be customised to suit the needs of Hyderabad,\u201c Prof V Srinivas Chary , ASCI director of urban program, told TOI.Surat, a city with one of the highest per capita income, has witnessed 25 notable floods in 100 years. Of these, eight to nine were in the last 20 years itself. \u201cTwo historic events, the 1994 plague and the 2006 floods, which caused a loss of $2 billion, made the corporation fight back. In 2009, Surat was selected for the Asian cities resilient network for climate change. Later, a multistakeholder trust was formed to study various aspects of urban flooding, water supply , environment and its impact on health," Kamlesh Yagnik, Su rat's chief resilient officer told TOI over phone.The UK-based Rockefeller Foundation chose Surat to be part of 100 resilient global cities. \u201cThe authorities later relocated at least 50,000 families from encroached areas into new buildings,\u201c said Yagnik.GHMC officials feel they face a peculiar situation regarding grant of building approvals. \u201cAs per rules, building permission can be granted in 30 days. But we have a lot of pressure to grant it early. With limited staff, processing and checking the facts on the ground is difficult. We will study the Surat model and check if it can be applied to the city . Hyderabad has been witnessing 8-10 cm rain in a span of oneand-half hour. We need Rs 12,000 crore to clear encroachments on nalas. Last October, we demolished 800 structures soon after the floods, but legal cases followed. This time, we have served notices on 1,000 structures. We have filed a caveat to stop litigation,\u201c GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy told TOI.

VGAUMUKH: The snout of the Gangotri glacier Gaumukh - from where the Ganga river emerges has been so impacted by debris falling from nearby areas due to landslides that it has altered the course of the river.This startling discovery was made during a recently-organised trek from Gangotri to Gaumukh (of which TOI was a part) during which environmentalists and scientists found that not only have cracks appeared in the glacier situated at a height of around 13,200 feet (4,023 m), but also a lake-like structure has formed here from where the main stream of the Ganga (known as Bhagirathi) is flowing. Scientists found that because of the formation of the lake, the river is now flowing from the left side of the glacial snout instead of straight as was the case earlier.Navin Juyal, senior scientist at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, who was part of the trek, told TOI that if the Ganga continues to flow in its changed course from the lake, it might eventually lead to collapse of Gaumukh."A stream emanating from a tributary glacier was blocked probably due to the heavy rain which occurred in the month of July. This impounded stream got breached and released enormous amount of paraglacial debris in the form of alluvial fan, which changed the course of the river. If the glacier continues to melt and water continues to follow on the path of paraglacial debris touching the glacier snout, then large pieces of the snout will collapse," said Navin Juyal, senior scientist, Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad who was part of the 61-member trekking team that visited the area between October 11 and 14.Pictures clicked by Gulab Singh Negi who has been visiting Gaumukh almost every year since 1970s (to capture the change in the glacial snout through photographs), show a drastic change in the appearance of Gaumukh. Not only do the pictures support the claims of the crack that has appeared in the snout but also show how the debris from the nearby mountains has changed the course of Ganga leading to the formation of a lake here.Negi told TOI, "Ganga used to flow in a straight direction from its source Gaumukh earlier, but now it is clear that the river has changed its course. This is due to the lake that has formed because of debris falling from nearby areas due to climate change. Also, cracks have developed in the glacier. It is time that the debris is removed and Ganga is restored to its normal course or the cracks in the glacier will increase."Elaborating on the process behind formation of cracks in a glacier, Juyal said, "Glacier snouts are not stationary structures and therefore prone to cracks. A glacier has movement as its accumulation area which is covered by snow, pushes it forward. If snowfall reduces in the accumulation area, the glacier starts melting."

VMany of the biggest technology companies failed to deliver on commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and are still reluctant to commit fully to renewable energy, according to Greenpeace USA\u2019s Guide to Greener Electronics. (Image Source: AP) Many of the biggest technology companies failed to deliver on commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and are still reluctant to commit fully to renewable energy, according to Greenpeace USA\u2019s Guide to Greener Electronics. (Image Source: AP)\u000a\u000aThe environmental group Greenpeace issued a report on Tuesday giving technology titans including Samsung Electronics, Amazon and Huawei low marks for their environmental impact.\u000a\u000aMany of the biggest technology companies failed to deliver on commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and are still reluctant to commit fully to renewable energy, according to Greenpeace USA\u2019s Guide to Greener Electronics. The report, which assessed 17 top global tech companies in three areas, also faulted many of them for failing to use more recycled materials in their products and slow progress in phasing out use of toxic materials.\u000a\u000a\u201cTech companies claim to be at the forefront of innovation, but their supply chains are stuck in the Industrial Age,\u201d Gary Cook, a campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said in a statement. The report details the hidden cost behind what may be the most sought-after and celebrated consumer products in the 21st century: mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers.\u000a\u000aSince 2011, Greenpeace has urged global tech companies to transition to renewable energy, prompting some of them to switch to environmentally friendly power sources for their data centers. The group is setting broad sight: tackling energy issues in manufacturing and supply chains, designing longer-lasting products to reduce electronics waste, and urging the entire industry to rethink its \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d business model altogether.\u000a\u000aThe report highlighted that tech companies\u2019 manufacturing processes are not as environmentally friendly as their innovative images might suggest. While the energy consumption in the tech industry rose rapidly to fuel the supply chains and the manufacturing of these products as well as the data centers where social media, cloud computing and other applications run, so have the greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000aSamsung Electronics received a grade of D in its use of renewable energy, which accounted for just 1 percent of its manufacturing process, compared with Apple, which relied on renewable energy for 96 percent of its operation. Samsung, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones and key component suppliers of many of the tech companies featured in the report, saw its greenhouse gas emissions rise 24 percent in 2016 from two years ago. It also received low marks on its efforts to reduce and disclose hazardous chemicals at workplaces and to design long-lasting products.\u000a\u000aSamsung Electronics did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Chinese smartphone makers Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, which have gained a significant market share in the last few years, have scored below average in all categories and lacked transparency and commitment in renewable energy, the report said.\u000a\u000aAmazon was the only US company that received the lowest mark, an F, in its overall environmental performance, along with the Chinese phone makers. Greenpeace said Amazon was among the least transparent companies and did not report the greenhouse gas footprint of its own operations. Among the 17 companies, Amsterdam-based Fairphone and Apple were assessed to be performing better in various areas.\u000a\u000aGreenpeace urged the companies to use more renewable energy, especially switching the energy sources that power their supply chains. It also urged the tech companies to remove hazardous chemicals and other materials from their products and workplaces and design longer-lasting devices to help reduce waste. If the tech industry does not change to renewable energy, the world won\u2019t be able to tackle climate change, said Greenpeace campaigner Lee Insung.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the next three to five years, the use of renewable energy and how well the companies cope with climate change will determine their core competitiveness,\u201d Lee said.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App

VBEIJING: China will have to launch more ambitious renewable energy and non-fossil fuel targets and ramp up efforts to enforce them to avoid missing global climate accord requirements, two government think tanks said on Monday.\u000a\u000aChina's capacity for renewable energy, including hydro, wind and solar, will significantly exceed Beijing's own target set in the five-year plan to 2020, according to the report jointly issued by China National Renewable Energy Centre (CNREC) and the Energy Research Institute of Academy of Macroeconomic Research.\u000a\u000aThe world's top energy consumer pledged to install 340 gigawatts (GW) of hydropower capacity, 210 GW of wind and 110 GW solar by 2020 in the five-year plan.\u000a\u000aBut to meet commitments agreed to in 2015 in the Paris global pact to fight climate change, China should raise its target for non-fossil fuel to 26 percent of its total energy mix from a current target of 15 percent by 2020, the report said.\u000a\u000a"The Paris agreement of reducing the global temperature by two degrees puts pressure on the short-term energy transition from coal and oil to non-fossil fuels," said Wang Zhongying, deputy director general at CNREC.\u000a\u000aChina, the world's second-largest economy, overtook the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007.\u000a\u000aChina pledged to bring its carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 or earlier as part of a joint pledge made with the United States ahead of the 2015 Paris talks.\u000a\u000aIf current government policy is enforced properly, non-fossil fuels should account for 60 percent of energy supply by 2050, higher than an official government target of reducing coal alone to just half, the report said.\u000a\u000aStill, getting stranded clean power in the west to urban users has been a major headache for the government as Beijing seeks wean the nation off coal, the nation's favourite fuel.\u000a\u000aAn official at the National Energy Administration said at the conference on Monday he reckons the country will solve the problem of wasted energy by 2020.\u000a\u000aChinese authorities have been striving to improve energy efficiency and upgrade energy infrastructure by introducing measures including national carbon trade, green certificates and promoting energy storage systems.\u000a\u000a"(But) to ensure compliance with the Paris agreement, strong support to renewable energy deployment is needed on both the national and local levels," said Wang.\u000a\u000a

The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the UN weather agency's annual flagship report, tracks the continent of dangerous gasses in atmosphere in the post-industrial era (since 1750).\u000a\u000aThe report also said that the last time Earth experienced similar CO2 concentration rates was three to five million years ago, when the sea level was up to 20 metres (66 feet) higher than now.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe historic agreement approved by 196 countries two years ago is facing renewed pressure following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to quit the accord.

VNEW YORK: Climate changes may be forcing bamboo lemurs - one of the most endangered primate species on Earth - to change their dietary habits, causing them to slowly starve, an international study warns.The study, published in the journal Current Biology, analysed the anatomic, behavioural and paleontological data of lemurs along with climate data.Lemurs almost exclusively eat a single species of bamboo, including the woody trunk, known as culm.However, they prefer the more nutritious and tender bamboo shoots and use their specialised teeth to gnaw on culm only when necessary, during the dry season.Researchers suggest that as Earth's climate changes, bamboo lemurs will gradually be forced to eat culm for longer periods and this could slowly starve them."For extreme feeding specialists like the greater bamboo lemur, climate change can be a stealthy killer," said Patricia Wright at Stony Brook University in the US."Making the lemurs rely on a suboptimal part of their food for just a bit longer may be enough to tip the balance from existence to extinction," Wright said.Wright and her colleagues from Finland and Australia first showed that the greater bamboo lemurs are equipped with highly complex and specialised teeth, just like giant pandas - the only other mammal capable of feeding on culm.These teeth make it possible for them to consume and survive on woody culm for parts of the year, researchers said.The team spent hours watching them in their natural habitat in Madagascar 's Ranomafana National Park over a period of 18 months.Researchers collected more than 2,000 feeding observations in total. Those data showed that the lemurs spend 95 per cent of their feeding time eating a single species of woody bamboo.However, they only eat the culm from August to November, when dry conditions make tender shoots unavailable, researchers said.Climate models suggest that the areas where the lemurs currently are found are likely to experience longer and longer dry seasons in the future. As the lemurs are left with only culm to eat for longer periods, it could put their survival at risk, they said.The findings may have implications for understanding the fate of bamboo-feeding giant pandas, too. Giant pandas are threatened by deforestation and changes in the distribution of bamboo.However, the new data suggest that a changing climate may also endanger bamboo feeders in a more subtle way, by affecting the seasonal availability of preferred and more nutritious bamboo parts.

VNAGPUR: Faced with unseasonal hailstorms , wet and dry droughts, and damage to eco-systems, the state government has finally come out with a climate change policy.The comprehensive policy, announced two days ago, has directed all district collectors to prepare strong action plans considering geographical conditions of the district to make disaster management plans in line with climate change indicators.Protecting forests with participation of people, adopting crop pattern with changing situations, going solar for farming, setting up of climate proof villages, promoting organic farming, eco-system based schemes, and judicious use of water are some of the recommendations of the climate change policy announced by the government.As per the government, Nandurbar followed by Dhule, Buldhana, Jalgaon, Hingoli, Nashik, Jalna, Gondia, Washim and Gadchiroli districts are top on vulnerability index of climate change effects.The Centre had in 2008 directed all states to prepare an action plan. As reported by TOI in 2014, the 19-member Maharashtra State Council on Climate Change was formed in September 2008. Its chairperson was the chief minister, and it included ministers and experts.The council had awarded work on preparing state\u2019s action plan on climate change to The Energy Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi, on August 20, 2009, for Rs98 lakh. Finally, after eight years, the state has announced adaptation and mitigation strategy based on the TERI plan.Based on the plan, the state has warned that owing to climate change there will be adverse impact on horticulture crops like pomegranate, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangoes etc by 2030. Besides, increasing temperatures and irregular rains will lead to spread of diseases.The government has defined a role for every department to tackle climate change. Forest department has been told to increase ecological services, by even paying people to protect forests, and reduce biotic pressure on forests. It has been told to take up scientific management of forests.Similarly, water resources department (WRD) has been told to rejuvenate rivers, recycle waste water, and improve water management among a host of other directions. Other departments like agriculture, energy, health, public works, rural and urban development, finance and planning, and environment have been asked to devise eco-friendly strategies while implementing projects.As per the division-level index, by 2030 the minimum temperature in Nagpur will increase by 1.18-1.40 degrees, Amravati (1.44-1.64), Aurangabad (1.44-1.56), Nashik (1.4-1.68), Pune (1.15-1.28), and Konkan (1.1-1.28). Similar projections have been made for 2050 and 2070 also.To gear up to face the challenge, the state has recommended various steps for all departments by categorizing them in first and second priority. Forest department has been told to take up all recommendations on top priority.

VMUMBAI: Thane district is expected to replace Greater Mumbai as the prime economic hub of the state. The projection has been made by The Energy and Resource Institute ( TERI ), Delhi, in its report \u2018Assessing Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Strategies for Maharashtra\u2019.Recommendations from the report were recently approved by the state cabinet for implementation as part of the government\u2019s action plan for climate change. TERI started work on the report in 2010 and submitted it to the government in 2013 but it was formally accepted only early this month.The report states Mumbai\u2019s percentage contribution to the state GDP is expected to decline as it reaches saturation. TERI has projected Thane to grow at 8.1% annually till 2051, while Greater Mumbai is expected to grow at a slow pace of 4.1%.\u201cAlthough this is a stark change it is not a surprise since Thane is geographically adjacent to Mumbai, and with severe space constraints in Mumbai, Thane has started to develop rapidly and in the future could be expected to take over Mumbai as the prime economic hub of the state,\u201d the report states.It paints a grim picture for Mumbai vis--vis other districts in the state. \u201cWhile in 2001 the top three districts Thane, Mumbai (suburban) and Pune contributed to around 35% of the state\u2019s GDP, in 2051 Mumbai (suburban) was replaced by Nashik as one of the three largest districts, and along with Pune and Thane contribute 36% of the state\u2019s GDP,\u201d reads the report.The Economic Survey of Maharashtra (2016-17) figures for gross district value added shows Mumbai is the largest contributor to the state GDP and has maintained a steady 35% lead over Thane since 2011-12. The projected decline in Mumbai\u2019s relative growth rate vis--vis Thane is still to materialise.Economics professor Sangita Kamdar at the School of Business, Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (Vile Parle), said Mumbai\u2019s prohibitive land prices were pushing industries to Thane and Pune. \u201cMumbai will eventually become a financial district. It is not that Mumbai will decline, but the other districts will catch up with Mumbai as manufacturing moves to these districts and generates employment,\u201d she said.The projected decline in Mumbai\u2019s GDP growth rate has not factored in any impact of sea level rise or climate change. The report states Mumbai is vulnerable to sea level rise. The net level sea rise trend for Mumbai is 1.2mm/year.Quality of life, especially in the island city, may also be adversely impacted with warm nights and maximum discomfort from felt temperatures. According to TERI, Mumbai region will experience temperatures in 2030 higher by 1.3-1.4 degrees Celsius over normal temperatures during 1970-2000. The city\u2019s minimum temperature is also expected to increase by 2030, translating to warmer nights and associated discomfort.Explaining the phenomenon of warmer nights, Dr P K Nandankar, Indian Meteorological Department (Pune) said in coastal areas there is an abundance of moisture in the atmosphere which causes discomfort. On account of clouding, excess heat radiated from the earth does not escape into the atmosphere but is trapped in clouds, further increasing the temperature.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe UN Environment Emissions Gap Report 2017 warns that a big carbon emissions gap exists between the levels that can be achieved in 2030 with present climate commitments, and what needs to be done using set pathways to limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2 Celsius or a more ambitious 1.5 C by the year 2100.\u000a\u000aThe report says full implementation of the unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and comparable action afterwards \u201ccould result in a temperature increase of about 3.2 C by 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels\u201d, while full implementation of conditional NDCs would marginally lower that projection by about 0.2C.\u000a\u000aThe breaching of the safe limits that is possible even with current climate commitments \u2014 the NDCs that form the core of the Paris Agreement \u2014 indicates that governments will need to deliver much stronger pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions when they are revised in 2020, said the report released ahead of the 23Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Bonn, commencing on November 6.\u000a\u000aFossil fuels and cement production account for about 70% of greenhouse gases, the report noted. The alarming number and intensity of extreme weather events in 2017, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, add to the urgency of early action, it said.\u000a\u000aSeveral green options\u000a\u000aThe report reveals a large gap between targeted 2030 emission levels and those consistent with least expensive pathways to the 2C and 1.5C goals. The 2C emissions gap for the full implementation of both the conditional and unconditional NDCs for 2030 is 11 to 13.5 gigatonne CO 2 equivalent (GtCOe). The gap in the case of the more ambitious 1.5C target is 16 to 19 GtCO 2 e. Should the U.S. follow through with its threat to leave the Paris Agreement in 2020, the picture could become bleak.\u000a\u000aThe Paris accord pledges only a third of what is needed to avoid climate catastrophe, and adopting new technologies in key sectors, at investments of under $100 per tonne of emissions, could cut them by up to 36 gigatonnes per year by 2030, which is more than sufficient to bridge the current gap.\u000a\u000aA large part of the potential to close the emissions gap lies in solar and wind energy, efficient appliances and passenger cars, afforestation and stopping deforestation. These six factors hold a total potential of up to 22 GtCO 2 e per annum, the report says. Strong action on plugging other greenhouse gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons, through the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, and other short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon, could contribute.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,\u201d Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, said in a media release.\u000a\u000aCO 2 emissions have remained stable since 2014, driven in part by renewable energy, notably in China and India.

As glaciers in the Western Himalayas continue to disappear, the runoff that supplies Pakistan\u2019s rivers could drop by 40 to 50 per cent\u000a\u000aClimate change has \u201cenormous\u201d geopolitical implications in the Himalayas, particularly in the region between India and Pakistan, where destabilisation of water flows make the area ripe not just for conflict but also for devastation, a top US Senator has warned.\u000a\u000aNoting that Pakistan\u2019s major rivers are all fed by glacial meltwater from India, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told a Washington audience this week that more melting meant more flow, and climate change also can intensify heavy rains during the monsoon season.\u000a\u000aReferring to a study, he said even an optimistic scenario on climate change would cut the Himalayan glacier mass more than a third by 2100.\u000a\u000aBusiness as usual means loss of nearly 70 per cent of glacier mass, Whitehouse said, adding that \u201cbecause they are melting, the glaciers are also shrinking\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis has enormous geopolitical implications,\u201d he said in his key note address to The Hudson Institute, a top US think-tank, on the release of a report \u201cAn Integrated Approach to the Himalayas\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the region, relations between Pakistan and India have long been fraught; in human history, violent conflicts over water are as old as memory; Kashmir is a crucible of contest for riparian control of great rivers; and climate change is destabilising water flows. The result of this combination is a region ripe for conflict, even devastation,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAt some point, the swell of added meltwater is offset by the shrinkage of the glacier, and the system veers from flood toward drought. As glaciers in the Western Himalayas continue to disappear, the runoff that supplies Pakistan\u2019s rivers could drop by 40 to 50 per cent, he noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn top of all of this, India is planning to build dams on the Chenab River in volatile Kashmir, through which the river flows downstream to Pakistan. Pakistan fears India pinching the Chenab\u2019s flow to put pressure on Islamabad, especially in times of heightened conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cSuspicions of riparian mischief run high, and partition-era memories linger. Food security, power generation and public safety are all at stake, giving nuclear-armed adversaries a lot to fight over,\u201d Whitehouse said.\u000a\u000aThe report, produced by a working group of seven US-based experts on Asia, lays out a plan for the US to pursue an integrated approach with friendly states in the Himalayas to address strategic and population security issues, regional connectivity, water usage, climate change and cultural preservation, besides the protection of women and minorities.\u000a\u000aAparna Pande, director of Hudson\u2019s India Initiative, said that weak states and contested sovereignties across the Himalayas have induced a number of regional actors to seek deeper physical and economic connectivity within the region through new infrastructure that supports transportation needs, trade and commerce, and access to resources.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, longstanding border disputes and rivalries mean that efforts to foster greater connectivity in the Himalayas are laden with geopolitical significance,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aPande noted that till recently the US had preferred to adopt a \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach but the Hudson report recommends that it should engage in a more hands-on role in regional connectivity schemes to promote American interests.\u000a\u000aShe said the US would benefit by supporting and expanding the Quality Infrastructure Initiative (QII) developed by Japan as an alternative to Chinese-led initiatives like the One Belt and One Road (OBOR) and the Belt and Road (BRI).\u000a\u000aJeff Smith, Research Fellow on South Asia at The Heritage Foundation said, India\u2019s relationships with many of its neighbours have improved, particularly with Bangladesh, but not with China and Pakistan.\u000a\u000aChinese incursions in Ladakh, control of Gwadar port in Pakistan, military base in Djibouti and the recent Doklam standoff have created avenues for friction and competition between China and India, he said.\u000a\u000aSmith also criticised Pakistan for its role in supporting \u201cinsurgencies, terrorist groups operating within Pakistan targeting India, Afghanistan and the US\u201d.\u000a\u000aSmith said while he did not see Pakistan taking a fundamentally different approach towards terrorists within its borders, Smith said he does see the US taking a different approach as was clear from the statements by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis.\u000a\u000aTheir statements show greater willingness from the US to use transactional approach in conveying to Pakistan that if there are not results, then there will be costs to pay, he said.\u000a\u000aMichael Kugelman, Senior Associate for South Asia at Wilison Center, said that \u201cwater can become a weapon in regional geopolitics\u201d.\u000a\u000aIn its report, Hudson Institute recommends the Trump administration to pursue closer ties with India to help balance an assertive China, reduce Indo-Chinese tensions and demonstrate to Pakistan the severe consequences for supporting extremism.\u000a\u000aIt also urges US to engage in a more hands-on approach regarding trans-Himalayan connectivity to support development that serves the people of the region.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VNew Delhi: The International Solar Alliance ( ISA ) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) today signed a Joint Financial Partnership Declaration with the objective to deepen their cooperation on renewable energy.Speaking on the occasion, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said India has been in the forefront of the 42-nation ISA. \u201cIndia, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has pledged unequivocal commitment for furthering the cause of new and renewable energy since the Paris COP21 UN Climate Change Conference,\u201d Jaitley said.The deceleration for the promotion of solar energy was signed by Upendra Tripathy, Interim Director General of ISA and Nandita Parshad, Managing Director of EBRD for energy and natural resources. Ministry of New & Renewable Energy Secretary Anand Kumar , French Ambassador Alexandre Ziegler and EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti were also present on the occasion.ISA was initially proposed by PM Modi and launched at the India Africa Summit ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. India has committed to host ISA Secretariat for five years between 2016 and 2021. It will also contribute $27 million to the ISA for creating corpus, building infrastructure and recurring expenditure.\u201cISA needs to firm-up such financial partnership deals with more multilateral and bilateral donor agencies in order to meet its stated objectives of getting better technology; aiding easier costing to improve affordability of solar energy,\u201d Jaitley said, adding that both the signing parties should go in for innovation of new and dynamic mechanism for credit enhancement and risk mitigation in the solar sector.ISA is working for deployment of over 1,000 GW of solar energy and mobilising more than $1,000 billion into solar energy by the year 2030. \u201cThe collaboration will provide an opportunity to EBRD to support solar energy investment in the least developed countries, especially in Africa. This will also help funding of solar projects both in African and other countries,\u201d Upendra Tripathy, Interim Director General ISA said.EBRD is keenly interested to increase its green financing portfolio to 40 per cent of its annual business, the ministry of finance said in a statement. Till date, the EBRD has invested more than \u20ac4 billion directly in renewable energy, supporting projects in over 20 countries and funding more than 6.5 GW of capacity, the statement added.

VA globe with the national flags hangs in one of the pavilions at the UN Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday. (Source: AP) A globe with the national flags hangs in one of the pavilions at the UN Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany, on Tuesday. (Source: AP)\u000a\u000aIndia and developing countries scored an important victory at the climate change conference here, with some of their key demands on \u2018pre-2020 actions\u2019 getting agreed upon and included in the draft decisions that will be adopted at the end of the two-week meeting.\u000a\u000aRight from the first day of the conference, India, and \u2018like-minded developing countries\u2019, a negotiating group of more than 20 countries, had demanded that \u2018pre-2020 actions\u2019 \u2013 a reference to obligations mainly of the developed countries under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that still has three years to run \u2013 be included in the official agenda of discussions. They had also been asking for a deadline for the ratification of 2012 Doha amendments to the Kyoto Protocol to give a legal shape to the \u2018pre-2020\u2019 commitments.\u000a\u000aAfter a week of squabbling, the solution that came out was not exactly what the developing countries had been demanding, but still addressed their issues adequately enough. It was agreed that the next two climate conferences, in 2018 and 2019, will have special \u2018stock-taking\u2019 sessions on the \u2018pre-2020 actions\u2019 being taken by different countries. This stock-take would include not just the efforts that countries were taking to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions but also the kind of progress that developed nations were making on their obligations to provide finance and technology support to the developing countries in helping them deal with climate change.\u000a\u000a\u2018Pre-2020 actions\u2019 would also be included for discussion in another scheduled review meeting at next year\u2019s conference where countries have to assess whether all the climate actions they are planning to take was commensurate to keeping the global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 or 2 degree celsius from pre-industrial times, which is the goal of the Paris Agreement.\u000a\u000aIn addition, it was also decided that the head of the conference, currently Fiji, and the secretary general of UN Climate Change would send joint letters to all the countries that have still not ratified the Doha Amendments to do so \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Countries have been asked to submit, by May 1 next year, to provide written information on steps they were taking to fulfil their \u2018pre-2020\u2019 obligations and to ratify the Doha Amendments.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a very satisfactory outcome for us\u2026. A strong message was communicated to developed countries that post-2020 climate action as part of the Paris Agreement cannot be divorced from pre-2020 commitments,\u201d Environment Secretary C K Mishra said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe year 2018 is an important year for the climate change negotiations as it would help finalize the Paris Agreement rulebook and perhaps would also be the last opportunity to close the emissions gap by developed countries,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe breakthrough came on a day that heads of states and ministers gathered in Bonn to give the final touches to decisions that would be taken here. In the last two days, countries have also reached separate agreements on issues related to agriculture, loss and damages, integration of gender in climate policy. All these agreements, including the one reached on \u2018pre-2020 actions\u2019, would be reflected in the final decisions to be adopted at the end of Bonn meeting.\u000a\u000aA number of other issues, including those related to finance, and preparation of the rulebook for the Paris Agreement, are still under discussions.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VCatastrophic threats of large-scale losses of crops or animals \u2013 the type that might come along every 5 to 10 years, for instance, and force those hit to migrate \u2013 might be dealt with in part with insurance plans, Laganda said. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aClimate change threats, from worsening drought and flooding to sea level rise, could increase the risks of hunger and child malnutrition around the world by 20 percent by 2050, food security researchers warned Wednesday. But looking carefully at the very different risks facing each country, region and type of food producer \u2013 from highland rice farmers in Cambodia to cattle herders in South Sudan \u2013 could help reduce that threat of growing hunger, they said. In North Africa, for instance, both herders and farmers face fast-growing risks from more frequent, longer and more intense heatwaves and declining water availability, while population growth and greater urbanisation could also hit food security, according to a report by the World Food Programme (WFP) released Wednesday at the U.N. climate talks in Bonn.\u000a\u000aIn South Asia, by comparison, dense populations of farmers face threats from worsening floods, cyclones and droughts, as well as long-term threats to the stability of monsoons and water flow in glacier-fed rivers.\u201cDifferent groups are affected by different types of risks, at different intensities and at different times,\u201d said Gernot Laganda, the director of climate and disaster risk reduction programmes at WFP. Building greater resilience to the threats will require \u201clayers\u201d of responses, he said.\u000a\u000aCatastrophic threats of large-scale losses of crops or animals \u2013 the type that might come along every 5 to 10 years, for instance, and force those hit to migrate \u2013 might be dealt with in part with insurance plans, Laganda said.\u000a\u000aBut more regular seasonal threats \u2013 of smaller-scale flooding, for instance \u2013 cannot be insured, he said, as the problems come too frequently. In those cases, building savings groups among women farmers, for instance, to ensure cash is on hand to deal with the crop failures, could be a better way to deal with risks. The report aims to give country governments, and food security organisations, a clearer and more specific look at the threats they face, and better tools to deal with them. It looks in detail at particularly threatened regions, including parts of Africa and Asia, and at 15 specific countries, from Afghanistan to Mali.\u000a\u000aOne surprise from the work, Laganda said, is that it was not always the poorest countries that were most vulnerable to hunger threats. \u201cSometimes we assume middle-income countries have a much easier time \u2026 which is not necessarily the case,\u201d he said. South Asia, in particular, has big numbers of hungry people, he said and overall \u201cthe largest vulnerabilities to loss and damage in food systems occur in Asia\u201d.\u000a\u000aIn Africa, drought is the biggest threat to hunger levels, but conflicts also play a big role, he said.\u000a\u000aLaganda said such differences need a careful look if countries and food security agencies are to better manage coming climate threats and achieve the international goal of ending hunger by 2030, one of a set of so-called Sustainable Development Goals. \u201cWe are not going to achieve zero hunger by 2030 if we do not factor climate-related shocks and stresses into our equation,\u201d he warned. \u201cClimate needs to factor into food security discussions \u2026 at a country level in a much bigger form than it does now.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd aid agencies like WFP \u2013 as much as governments \u2013 need to focus more on risk management, he said. Mikael Eriksson, who works on climate, energy and environmental issues for Sweden\u2019s government, said the growing complexity of humanitarian disasters requires innovation and rethinking old ways of doing things. \u201cPrevention is so much more efficient than disaster management,\u201d he said.

VDemonetisation and GST may have had a positive and negative impact on the Indian economy, but no one would have thought that reducing India\u2019s carbon emissions growth would be one of its benefits. Yet, that was one of the major fallouts of the combo regulation, even as global carbon emissions continued to grow this year.Scientists think that India\u2019s emissions will pick up with economic growth in a year or two, and thus put pressure on other countries to reduce their share even further.Global carbon dioxide emissions growth had slowed down in the last three years, giving hope to environmentalists and policymakers around the world that the Paris Climate Agreement might work. But it picked up again this year, as a widely discussed paper in the journal Environment Research Letters showed two days ago. The growth has come mainly from China, which had gone back to using more coal in its power plants. \u201cTime is running out on our ability to keep global temperature increases below 2 Centigrade and,\u201d the authors of the paper wrote, \u201ceven more immediately, anything close to 1.5 Centigrade.\u201dThe research paper and a series of other papers and announcements have coincided with the climate talks in Bonn this week. This annual United Nations conference has continued where the Paris conference left off, looking at where countries have not kept up to their promises in Paris.In the last year, global carbon dioxide emissions had increased by around 36 gigatonnes, and this level had remained roughly steady over the last three years.Although the rate was still high, environmental scientists and policymakers have been pleased at the plateau in the rate of increase. The consensus was that the rate of increase will remain steady and start going down soon. This year\u2019s expected increase of 2% over last year, driven by China, shows that a decrease may not happen soon. \u201cTrends in China are such a big part of the global story,\u201d says Navroz Dubash, senior fellow of the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.The alarm among some scientists is because of the limited carbon budget available for the world to keep temperature increases to below 2 Centigrade. Many scientists think that temperature increases above this level can cause runaway effects that are difficult or impossible to control. Although 2 Centigrade is an arbitrary number, uncertainties in modelling increase rapidly after this temperature, which was why scientists largely think of it as a limit.At current levels of increase, the world will use up the carbon budget to keep temperature increase down to below 2 Centigrade within 15 years. The more carbon budget we use up every year, the less time we have to keep the temperatures to below the 2 C number. This is why the projected increase in the rate of emissions has so worried the scientists. But not everyone is alarmed at the moment.\u201cThe emission rate will go up and down for some time,\u201d says J Srinivasan, distinguished scientist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, \u201cBut my view is that the global carbon dioxide emissions are stabilising.\u201dIn his view, the world is at an inflection point in the way it uses energy, but it is not easy to predict how long it will take for the emissions to start coming down. Most developed countries have stabilised in their emissions, and have started showing a decrease. China, the world\u2019s largest emitter, may have some way to go before stabilisation. India, still some distance away from being a developed country, will take even longer.As the country soon with the largest population, India is a key player in keeping global temperature down. \u201cThe heat is off India at the moment,\u201d says Dubash. \u201cBut it will come back.\u201d(Global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel use and industry (open circles) and gross world product expressed as purchasing power parity since 1990. Numbers for 2017 are projections.)(From top to bottom: Relative to year 2000, gross domestic product, global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel use and industry, global energy use, CO2 intensity of the energy system (global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel use and industry divided by global energy use), and energy intensity of the global economy (global energy use divided by global GDP) from 1990\u20132017)Burning of fossil fuels and industry together contribute nearly 90% of the global emissions, with deforestation and land degradation contributing the rest. When taken by sectors, industry contributes 21% of the emissions. A report four months ago from the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) showed that 70% of the emissions from 1998 are from just 100 large companies. Global emissions will decrease significantly if a few thousand large corporations cut their carbon footprint. So far, their efforts are not significant enough, according to CDP.Of the 1,839 high-impact companies identified by CDP, around 1,000 started disclosing their carbon emissions. Of these, only 14% have set targets for themselves, and very few have goals consistent with the Paris Agreement. Among the high-impact companies, 61 are in India, and 23 disclose their carbon emissions. No one is Paris-compliant. \u201cCompanies are doing something,\u201d says Damandeep Singh, CDP director, India. \u201cBut it is nowhere near enough.\u201dOf late, global emission of methane has been rising, and scientists have not figured out all the reasons. This gas is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its heat-trapping potential, and is produced from both natural and human sources. Agriculture and dairy farming are the most significant human sources of methane while wetlands and oceans form the natural sources.Many scientists fear that rising temperatures can cause methane to escape from sources where it is buried at the moment, causing runaway global warming So they are watching methane emissions closely, but do not know where the increase is coming from. \u201cAt this moment we cannot untangle the natural from the human sources of methane,\u201d says Anita Ganesan, lecturer at the School of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol. A few months ago, Ganesan had shown that methane emissions from India were not rising.Although the news is not good overall, many scientists are hopeful of a slowdown in the greenhouse gas emissions growth and their eventual decline. Forests form an important part of the future methods to control emissions.Large-scale deforestation caused forests to emit carbon in the 1980s, but this trend seemed to have turned around at the moment.Although tropical forests are still being destroyed, the global story is not bad. \u201cThe rate of deforestation has slowed down at a global scale,\u201d says Govindasamy Bala, professor at the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences in IISc.\u201cNow forests are a net sink for carbon.\u201d While how this happens has not been directly measured, scientists think that now forests can take in up to 30% of the carbon that is being emitted. And can take more. Which is where remedial action can begin immediately.

VKolkata: An economist who was part of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, says it is imperative that cities and states participate in India\u2019s climate response action plans and have a say in the commitments made at the global level.Joyashree Roy, economist at Jadavpur University and global change programme coordinator, was speaking in the context of West Bengal\u2019s representation at the Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, earlier this month. Only senior scientist Dipanjana Moulin represented the environment department at the summit. \u201cStates must demand greater participation in determining India\u2019s climate response at the national and global levels. For Bengal, this is an investment opportunity as well,\u201d Roy said.She added: \u201cCity and state-level action has to streamline with the national goals.\u201d Kolkata and south Bengal are among the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change, with sea-level rise estimated to cause huge inundation and displacement. Climate change mitigation will affect eastern states the most as they are rich in coal. According to Roy, Bengal must start a dialogue on investment to clean up the coal sector with the zest it had exibited in the run-up to the GST rollout.\u201cA senior official needs to take a leadership position on how the National Clean Energy Fund accrued from coal cess is disbursed among coal-rich states in the east, including Bengal, to invest in clean coal technology,\u201d said Roy. As the world talks about deep decarbonisation, India has no alternative but to become carbon-neutral. Bengal and other coal-rich states will require funds to be spent on environment clean-up, coal substitute, carbon capture and storage technology.

VSHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh is facing impacts of climate change as temperatures are rising and rainfall as well as snowfall are becoming erratic, affecting agriculture, horticulture and livelihoods. Most weather stations in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir are facing increasing trend of temperature in the last three decades.Giving an overview of changing weather patterns in Himachal Pradesh, director of Shimla Meteorological Centre Dr Manmohan Singh said monsoon in state was expanding but overall rainfall was on a decline. He added that most weather stations were reporting increasing trends in temperature in Himachal Pradesh as well as Jammu and Kashmir in the past 30 years. He added that snowfall days in Srinagar and Shimla were showing a decreasing trend.Senior scientific officer at Himachal Pradesh Council of Science and Technology Dr S S Randhawa said glaciers were direct indicators of climate change. \u201cIn Spiti valley, deglaciation has been to the extent of 10-12% during 2001 and 2007. The rate of retreat of glaciers in Baspa and Parvati basins has also been fast since 1962, in some cases as high as 172 meters per year. Area under snow cover too has changed between October to June in six basins,\u201d he added.Randhawa said decline in snow cover ranges between 5-37% in 2010- 2014 period as compared to 2015 and 2016. The number of lakes formed with water melted from glaciers and also due to landslides too is going up with 116 lakes in 2013 to 192 in 2015 in the Chenab basin, he added.Prof S K Bhardwaj from Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in Solan said climate change was affecting quality as well as yield of apple crop. With this, farmers of the hill state had started growing other fruits such as pomegranate and even vegetables like cabbage in apple orchards, he added.

VIndia is wooing private investors to contribute to clean initiatives such as renewable energy, green buildings and electric vehicles to meet its ambitious targets under the Paris Agreement even as finance from developed countries seems to dry up, the government has said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a strong linkage between economy and climate, we are working with a balanced approach,\u201d Suresh Prabhu, Union minister of commerce and industry, said in his address to the Climate Business Forum, organised by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).\u000a\u000aAn IFC analysis shows India will need $3.1 trillion in private investment between 2018-2030 to meet its emissions targets.

India still relies on heavily polluting sources like coal to generate 59% of its power. But over 300 million people in India are still without electricity.\u000a\u000aMoving to low carbon sources of energy requires investment and government support. Some argue that the move to renewable energy sources is an economic opportunity that India can take advantage of.\u000a\u000aIndia has said that developed countries have the responsibility to aid developing countries in this transition through financial contributions and technology transfer.

VNew Delhi: India's ambitious plans to meet its climate targets under the Paris Agreement represent about $3.1 trillion worth of investment opportunities by 2030, a report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) said on Thursday.According to IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, the sectors offering those investment opportunities are renewable energy, green buildings, transport infrastructure, electric vehicles and climate-smart agriculture.As per the IFC estimation, India's renewable energy sector that aims to install 175GW of capacity by 2022, has opportunities worth $448 billion. India aims for a 40 per cent of its installed capacity to be renewables (solar, wind, etc) by 2030.Aiming to tap rapid urbanisation, where according to earlier reports 70 per cent of the required construction by 2030 is yet to come, the report predicts $1.4 trillion worth investment opportunities in green-building and infrastructure.IFC further analyses that $250 billion investment could come in transport infrastructure and $667 billion in electric vehicles to meet the government's goal of electrifying all new vehicle by 2030.On solid waste management, IFC report states that $11 billion worth investment could come in this sector, to bridge the gap between the significant amount of waste produced and the availability of appropriate infrastructure for solid waste management by 2030.The report sees potential investments worth $128 billion in climate-smart urban water to collect, treat and manage urban wastewater to curb urban water stress and $194 billion climate-smart agriculture to boost agricultural productivity, enhance resource efficiency and resilience, and to modernise the sector in India."The only way that the South Asian countries can take advantage of these climate investment opportunities is with a strong and engaged private sector," said IFC CEO Philippe Le Hourou.Part of a regional study that examines the climate-investment opportunities in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the analysis says that all these countries together represent 7.38 per cent of the global carbon dioxide emissions.The report also identifies $172 billion of climate-smart investment opportunities in Bangladesh, $42 billion in Bhutan, $2 billion in the Maldives, $46 billion in Nepal, and $18 billion in Sri Lanka."We also need to have a comprehensive approach to creating markets for climate business in key sectors. That means putting in place necessary policy frameworks, promoting competition, and building capacity and skills to open new markets," added Le Hourou.

VThe climate change envoy also said that India is on the growth path to address needs of a large population and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.(Image source: Twitter) The climate change envoy also said that India is on the growth path to address needs of a large population and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.(Image source: Twitter)\u000a\u000aIndia has the \u201cintellectual capacity\u201d and potential to be a model for the rest of the world in tackling environmental issues, especially through the use of renewable energy sources, Sweden\u2019s envoy for climate change has said. Lars Ronnas, Swedish Ambassador for Climate Change, on his first visit to India, also asserted that there are \u201cvery strong interests\u201d in his country for bilateral cooperation in this field.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou (India) are the major economy, and China. And, it rests on India\u2019s shoulders\u2026the responsibility and the challenges, as to how we should design our society. And India has the potential to be a model for the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe climate change envoy also said that India is on the growth path to address needs of a large population and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia also has a very young population who are driving things. There are skilled people and you (India) have the knowledge and the intellectual capacity to do so. Also, the strong move towards use of renewable energy in India is encouraging,\u201d Ronnas told PTI in an interview.\u000a\u000aAsked in what areas of environmental sectors Sweden can cooperate with India, he said, there are \u201cgood prospects\u201d of Indo-Swedish collaboration.\u000a\u000aThere are scopes for working together in the area, from public transport to waste-to-energy, but first \u201cwe need to find a business model\u201d, the climate change envoy said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia and Sweden are different in size and other aspects. We are one of the top countries in innovation and business is global. And, we have some headways in terms of how to address waste, a major problem in all mega cities. So, the scope for collaboration, I am quite convinced they are.\u000a\u000aThe initiative for any further partnership has to come from India, but \u201cSweden is willing\u201d, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a number of MoUs already. Our PMs (Narendra Modi and Stefan Lofven) met last year. The business councils in Sweden are very much engaged.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, there is a very strong interest in my country for collaboration. We need to see how we can find collaborative approaches with different stakeholders,\u201d Ronnas said.\u000a\u000aAsked in which areas, India can focus in combating climate change, the envoy said use of green cars (electric, hybrid) and cycles can be promoted.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn many countries, we are seeing a lot of middle-aged men and women in the midst of their career, in good jobs, going to work cycling. But, if cycling has to be promoted, the authorities must ensure, the designated tracks are there and that those are not used by cars and other vehicles,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe also gave the example \u2018Bonus-Malus\u2019 system in Sweden for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, to emphasise his point.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the (Swedish) government new budget bill, it is proposed that if you buy a new car, based on combustion engine, you pay additional taxes, and if you by an environment-friendly, hybrid or electrical car, you get substantial benefit. If approved, it will apply from first half of next year.\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBesides, we have imposed carbon tax on vehicles since 1990s, as a means to cut emission, he said, adding the use of biogas-based fuel has also contributed to reduction in emission.\u000a\u000aRonnas arrived recently in India, and yesterday at an event at the TERI School of Advanced Studies in south Delhi, launched \u20187 Days Challenge\u2019 programme that will encourage students to take more sustainable and smart actions around choices they make as they \u201ceat, move and live\u201d through their daily lives.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe young generation must challenge my generation that they can do it in a different way than we have been doing. They should set an example in striving towards a sustainable living, creating a more sustainable planet,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aPrior to Delhi, he also visited Pune and Mumbai, and met top officials in the central and Maharashtra governments.

VImplemented properly, India\u2019s renewable energy push could do more than just slow down global warming. It could help pull millions out of poverty, especially in rural communities.A new study by the Washington DC-based think-tank, World Resources Institute , says that India\u2019s renewable energy push could help tackle poverty in rural communities by providing steady incomes, healthcare benefits, and skill-building opportunities to unskilled and semi-skilled workers.\u201cCreating good quality renewable energy jobs that will help reduce poverty in rural, underdeveloped regions is a less considered, but crucial added benefit,\u201d said Andrew Steer, President, World Resources Institute, which was established in 1982.India\u2019s target of adding 160GW of solar and wind energy capacity by 2022 is expected to generate more than 330,000 new jobs over the next five years. These jobs would be in construction, project commissioning and design, business development, and operations and management.According to a study by the New Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water and the Washington Dc-based think-tank Natural Resources Defense Council, these jobs will be \u201cfull-time equivalent\u201d. So, potentially these jobs could provide steady incomes.\u201cWind and solar growth can be a win-win opportunity for India; helping the country secure a clean energy future while tackling poverty,\u201d said Bharath Jairaj, Director of WRI India\u2019s energy program and lead author of the report.At last count, the solar and wind industry in India employed 151,000 people. The International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) estimates the solar industry in India employs 103,000 people, including 31,000 in grid-connected and 72,000 in offgrid applications, while another 48,000 people work in the wind sector.Globally, the renewable energy sector is emerging as a big employer. In its 2017 review, the Abu Dhabi-based intergovernmental body promoting renewable energy, IRENA, estimated that 9.8 million people were employed in the sector in 2016. The renewable energy sector is growing.According to IRENA, globally the jobs in the sector increased by 2.8% over 2015. Most of the renewable energy jobs are in China, Brazil, United States, India, Japan, and Germany, with 62% of the renewable energy jobs located in Asia.However the transition to a low-carbon pathway could take time, given the country\u2019s large unmet demand for electricity and need to rapidly ramp up economic growth. \u201cSteps are being undertaken to de-couple the Indian energy system from carbon in the long run. However, poverty eradication remains an overriding priority for us as we strive to ensure housing, electricity and food security for all,\u201d said Environment Minister Harshvardhan in his address to heads of state, ministers and other leaders at the UN-sponsored climate talks in November in Bonn.This \u201clong-run\u201d could get considerably shorter according to the study, Can Renewable Energy Jobs Help Reduce Poverty in India?The growing employment opportunities in the sector could support India\u2019s rural poor by offering an alternative to subsistence farming. But this would require policy interventions.\u201cUnless decision-makers act, this growth will leave the rural poor behind, unable to attain the thousands of new jobs created. Now is the time for leaders in business and government to build a clean energy sector that delivers electricity and employment to poor communities across India,\u201d said Jairaj.The poor - women in particular - find it difficult to take advantage of the growing employment opportunity. The lack of secondary schooling and lack of access to training centres in rural areas are among the barriers. \u201cEven when poor Indians overcome obstacles to attend training programs, the institutes\u2019 curricula don\u2019t often align with industry needs, making it difficult for graduates to secure goodquality jobs,\u201d said Pamli Deka, manager of WRI\u2019s Electricity Governance Initiative.To ensure that rural areas benefit from direct job creation in the renewable energy sector, the focus has to be on building the capacities of unskilled and semiskilled workers. In effect, the effort must be to create a cadre of trained workers who can step in to provide immediate assistance at renewable installations. That would ensure that in case of unavailability of technicians to immediately address issues, the energy-generation unit does not face closure. There is a need to review the manner of training programmes taking in students. There needs to be a degree of flexibility in the qualifying requirements.Not all training programmes require secondary education. This would create an employment pathway for the rural poor away from subsistence farming. Aligning institutes\u2019 curricula with industry needs would improve employment prospects as well. At present, many employers in the sector do not source their workforce from the training institutes.\u201cIn fact, we found that many clean-energy employers prefer to train people they hire, because they believe that the training institutes fail to provide the required and relevant skills,\u201d said Deka.Interventions like these could open up the renewable sector\u2019s growing employment opportunities to the rural poor. Beyond this, the benefits of transitioning to clean energy and electrifying rural communities will extend far beyond employment opportunities.For the world\u2019s poorest people, increased energy access means more time for children to study after school, greater productivity and income for families, and improved health outcomes.

VNotably, winds blowing during the Southwest monsoon have been found to be the most potential ones to harness energy. (Representational Image) Notably, winds blowing during the Southwest monsoon have been found to be the most potential ones to harness energy. (Representational Image)\u000a\u000aA wind assessment study recently conducted by the researchers at the IIT-B has revealed that even as climate change poses a constant threat to future generations, it could also prove to be a boon with increased generation of wind-powered electricity. The study, published in the Meteorological Applications, suggested that power generation from offshore wind turbines, if set up at Rameshwaram and Kanyakumari, off Tamil Nadu coast, and Jakhau along the Gujarat coast, could increase anywhere between 30 and 45 per cent.\u000a\u000aAt present, India generates power from onshore wind turbines. However, with the union government eyeing an expansion through offshore installations, these can be potential sites for power generation in the future, revealed the study.\u000a\u000aAs a part of their study, Sumeet Kulkarni from the Risk Management Solutions Department at IIT-B, along with senior scientists M C Deo and Subimal Ghosh from the Department of Civil Engineering, have studied winds in two time-slices \u2014 1979 to 2005 and 2006 to 2032. The results obtained revealed an increase in the wind speeds in the future, thereby confirming the possibility of higher power generation.\u000a\u000aKulkarni said the efficiency of wind potential extraction greatly depends on future climatic conditions too, which are likely to vary due to sustained greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThis, because greenhouse gas emissions have a direct effect on ambient temperature capable of altering air pressure and wind circulations,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aNotably, winds blowing during the Southwest monsoon have been found to be the most potential ones to harness energy. But, this holds true for Jakhau and Kanyakumari, both located along the west coast which experience strong winds during the season, typically between June and September. With only weak pulses of pre-summer and monsoon winds reaching Rameshwaram, situated on the east coast, this site has better potentials during the Northeast monsoon months, underlined the IIT-B team.\u000a\u000aHowever, Kulkarni said, as changing climate is believed to trigger more events like the El Nino (Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the years ahead, the overall circulation of winds could be affected, which could be used for more power generation.\u000a\u000aEl Nino usually makes an onset during October, and usually, its cycle lasts for a year, effecting winds during winter and subsequent summer months. Kulkarni said, \u201cIt has been found that during El Nino years, the Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) are higher in winter, thus interfering in the wind circulation patterns across the Indian peninsular regions \u2014 also the locations where the sites under study are located. The changing behaviours of wind circulation could mean that there can be more power generation possible even during winter months.\u201d\u000a\u000aSenior scientist Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, who has been appointed as a member of the Inter Panel Committee for Climate Change (IPCC) this year to study oceans reiterated the occurrence of extreme El Nino and La Nina conditions in the years ahead.\u000a\u000aKoll said, \u201cIt is true that wind circulations are affected by ENSO and has the capacity to alter the overall tele-connections. We will experience El Nino and La Nina, which will be far stronger than those recorded ever,\u201d adding, that the winds blown during Southwest monsoon are much stronger than those during the winter monsoon (Northeast monsoon).\u000a\u000aThe IIT-B study also derived that wind potential is set to increase substantially over the next three decades, with Rameshwaram topping at 29 per cent higher wind energy generation capacity, followed by Jakhau (24 per cent) and Kanyakumari (19 per cent). Thus, the actual extractable wind energy, the team suggests, will improve by 46 per cent at Rameshwaram, Jakhau (by 40 per cent) and Kanyakumari (by 35 per cent) in the coming decades.\u000a\u000aHowever, Koll is of the opinion that India needs to study and explore more in the area of energy generation using wind power, given the vast coastline it inhabits. \u201cIn fact, we can also become the market leaders in the South Asia region and there is definitely huge scope, similar to solar power, for this method of power generation,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Research News, download Indian Express App

VThough Trump never tweeted about it, this multilateral environmental accord, brokered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1987, was signed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan and fully supported by the Democrats. (Reuters)\u000a\u000aGeorge Bernard Shaw once said that \u201cEngland and America are two countries separated by the same language\u201d. When the UN conference on the Montreal Protocol on the substances that deplete the ozone layer ended in Montreal on November 24, albeit in the wee hours of November 25, I thought this could also be said for Paris and Montreal, not only because of the French language but also the agreements signed there on global action on the climate. The UN meeting in Montreal celebrated the 30th Anniversary of the success of the phase-out of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). The meeting in Bonn a week before, after its 25 years of global efforts, was still wondering how to even finalise the rulebook to stabilise the climate and keep the temperature rise to not more than to 2 degrees Celsius before 2100, while making efforts to limit that rise to 1.5 degrees \u2014 the objective of the Paris Climate Agreement. While US President Donald Trump is walking out of the keenly-negotiated Paris pact, he has surprisingly decided to support the Montreal Protocol, including its 2.0 version that now includes full-blast action against climate change. He has even agreed to take a nearly 25 per cent share of funding of over $500 million pledged by the developed countries to provide to the developing countries. The deal to provide $500 million over the next three years for the purpose was sealed in Montreal last week. It was warm news in the freezing temperatures at Montreal in contrast to the cold winds blowing from the Bonn climate conference.\u000a\u000aThe extraordinary success story of the Montreal Protocol never seems to have a full stop. Though Trump never tweeted about it, this multilateral environmental accord, brokered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1987, was signed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan and fully supported by the Democrats. Under the treaty, developed countries pledged all the incremental financial support to the developing countries during their transition away from ODS. More importantly, that pledge was honoured year after year without interruption, even during the global financial crisis. It has now reached a cumulative amount of $3.5 billion. Developing countries responded by implementing the transition to ozone-friendly technologies. The protocol has already achieved its goal of phasing out nearly 100 percent of millions of tonnes of more than 90 man-made ODSs like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), used mainly in refrigeration, air conditioning, foams and solvents. The factories producing these chemicals have literally shut down.\u000a\u000aIf the slogan \u201cYes We Can\u201d has a real-life example, it is this one. In one single generation, these ozone depleting chemicals were invented, their catastrophic impact on the stratospheric ozone layer that shields life on the Earth was scientifically identified, global action to phase them out was agreed through an international agreement, developing countries were provided by the developed countries all the incremental costs and technologies \u2014 and the phase-out of these chemicals was achieved exactly on the targeted year and day. Never before has such an astonishing chain of actions been triggered and taken to its completion. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called it \u201c\u2026the single-most successful international environmental agreement to date\u201d. Erik Solheim, Executive Director, UN Environment, during the opening ceremony on November 24, called the Montreal Protocol \u201ca testimony of the spirit of togetherness of nations and humans\u201d. That \u201ctogetherness\u201d has carried the Montreal Protocol\u2019s success beyond the phase-out of ODS. Major ODS like CFCs are also Green House Gases (GHGs). Thus, their phase-out under the Protocol has, as a side benefit, also resulted in the permanent cumulative emission reduction of GHGs to the extent of 130 giga tonnes equivalent of carbon dioxide by 2010, compared to just about one giga tonne of GHGs reduction aimed by 2012 under the Kyoto Protocol. In reality, GHGs increased during this period.\u000a\u000aWhile the Montreal Protocol did successful market transformation to an ozone-friendly world, the Kyoto Protocol remained fatally flawed. The 2015 Paris pact, a follow-up to the unfinished Kyoto Protocol, is still faltering and fudgy. The \u201ctogetherness\u201d highlighted by Solheim is conspicuous by its absence from climate agreements. However, it was ever evident under the Montreal Protocol. The latest achievement came when, in 2016, all 197 countries agreed to deploy the institutions nurtured under the Montreal Protocol for the last 30 years to now phase-down the deadly GHG \u2014 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) \u2014 some of which are more than 10,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. The developed countries, led by the US, pledged financial and technology support. That was an unprecedented decision, because the seminal objective of the Montreal Protocol was to get rid of ODS and not GHGs. \u201cIt was like using Non-Proliferation Treaty for nuclear weapons to control the trade in drugs and crime,\u201d said an African environmental law expert, commenting on the decision in Kigali. The Montreal Protocol, in other words, was used as a \u201csurrogate mother\u201d to carry the seeds of the Paris pact to deliver a climate-friendly baby.\u000a\u000aThere are two-fold reasons for that unusual action: First, HFCs were introduced as substitute for CFCs and other ODS due to their zero-ozone depleting potential. The countries therefore considered that getting away from HFCs would correct their unintended error and contribute to mitigation of climate change. Second, the developed countries agreed to the incremental funding for the developing countries for their \u2014 yet another \u2014 transformation from HFCs to non-HFCs. Thus, the Montreal Protocol has now entered its version 2.0 and became the treaty to reduce the emissions of the most potent global warming gas \u2014 HFC \u2014 which, incidentally, is also one of the six groups of the GHGs under the Paris pact.\u000a\u000aDeveloped countries will start reducing HFCs as early as 2019, while developing countries will start later. Phasing down HFCs under the Protocol is expected to avoid up to 0.5 degrees of global warming by the end of the century, while continuing to protect the ozone layer. If the energy efficiency improvements due to use of non-HFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning appliances are taken into account, then the avoided warming would be even more. That will be equivalent of achieving at least 25 per cent of the objective of the Paris pact. The world should now concede some cool points to President Trump and his administration amidst the warming and hot chaos.

VAlthough climate change deniers number too many for the Earth\u2019s well-being\u2014Donald Trump, president of the US, the largest carbon emitter in the world, is one\u2014and there are others who downplay the risks from this, the latest report of the US\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows how worrying this has become. (Image: Reuters)\u000a\u000aAlthough climate change deniers number too many for the Earth\u2019s well-being\u2014Donald Trump, president of the US, the largest carbon emitter in the world, is one\u2014and there are others who downplay the risks from this, the latest report of the US\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows how worrying this has become. There is, more or less, some familiarity across nations with the current and possible effects of global warming, but NOAA\u2019s latest report indicates that recent initiatives by nations may have had very little impact on reining in global warming. This year may have been slightly better than the last, but Arctic temperatures continued to increase at double the rate of the global temperature increase. More important, the current observed rates of sea-ice decline and rising oceanic temperatures were higher than at any other time in the last 1,500 years; this year\u2019s Arctic sea-ice maximum, measured in March, was the lowest ever observed\u2014at 14.42 million sq km, it was the lowest in the 38-year satellite record, beating 2015\u2019s maximum of 14.517 mn sq km and 2016\u2019s maximum of 14.52 mn sq km.\u000a\u000aThe sea-ice minimum, measured in September, was eighth lowest on record\u2014at 4.64 mn sq km on September 13. This was 1.58 mn sq km below the 1981 to 2010 median extent for the same day. The date of the minimum ice extent for 2017 itself was two days earlier than the average such date. Some may find consolation in the fact that Greenland, the most significant contributor to the sea-level rise, saw a slowdown in ice-mass loss this year, but many climate-researchers say that this may be just an anomaly. What is more worrying is that even if countries do meet their Paris commitments\u2014one research, the findings of which were reported in August by The Guardian, shows there is a paltry 5% chance of reaching the goal\u2014that may not prove enough.\u000a\u000aEven if signatories manage to keep the global temperature rise to under 2-degree C, they would still not be able to reverse the ice-melt cycle. In such a scenario, the push has to come from all quarters\u2014individuals, corporates, and governments\u2014to adopt drastic measures for further emission-reduction. The world certainly cannot afford to lose another decade on negotiations on climate change.

VThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has released a concept note of a proposal to build out India\u2019s manufacturing supply chain covering polysilicon, wafers/ingots, cells and modules to accelerate the growth of the country's solar photo-voltiac sector.\u000a\u000aMNRE is proposing a slew of subsidies and incentives including direct financial support of more than \u20b911,000 crore for manufacturers to expand and upgrade, a 12 GW Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) domestic content requirement (DCR) programme to create robust domestic demand, an increasing DCR requirement from modules to polysilicon, 30 percent central financial assistance, cheaper loans, a custom duty exemption and cheaper power.\u000a\u000aThe concept note is open to comments and suggestions until December 31, 2017. The programme aims to strengthen the Make in India campaign, reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign manufacturers, and make domestic manufacturers competitive with their international counterparts.\u000a\u000aIndian solar installations have risen from just 6 MW in 2009 to a cumulative total of approximately 20 GW to date, with another 9.5 -10 GW of installations expected this year alone, according to the Mercom India Q3 Market Update.\u000a\u000aThe Government is planning a three-pronged approach to support local manufacturers that includes: providing a level playing field with the imposition of anti-dumping duty on cells and modules, creating demand through a DCR program, and supporting manufacturers financially by providing multiple subsidies outlined in this policy proposal.\u000a\u000aTo ensure a guaranteed market, the policy proposes a 12,000 MW CPSU (this is higher than the earlier proposed 7.5 GWs) programme that would have to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\u000a\u000aIf these incentives are seriously implemented and there is clear visibility for the next five years of market demand, then more manufacturers from China and other countries may decide to establish manufacturing units in India.\u000a\u000aThe MNRE is preparing to announce a spate of tenders for solar projects in the coming four months, starting in December 2017. Under the plan, the MNRE expects to work alongside states to announce the tenders needed to reach 20 GW of ground-mounted capacity in solar parks in the 2017-18 fiscal year.\u000a\u000aAnother 30 GW is expected to be tendered in 2018-19 with 30 GW to follow in 2019-20.

VOTTAWA: A video on a starving polar bear in northern Canada's Nunavut region has led to concerns on climate change as well as doubts about the real cause of the beast's emaciation.Earlier this month, video and photos were published showing a scrawny polar bear rummaging in the garbage for food in an abandoned fishing camp on Somerset Island of Nunavut, Xinhua news agency reported.The heartbreaking scene was shared and retweeted around the world for millions of times, with people in the comments arguing over the phenomenon of shrinking Arctic sea ice because of global warming, which makes hunting harder for animals like polar bears."The simple truth is this -- if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems," said Paul Nicklen, a photographer with a documentary team at the "soul-crushing scene".The video directly puts the blame on climate change as the script in the beginning says: "This is what climate change looks like."Yet there are people doubting the whole thing as agenda driven, saying the polar bear could be terribly sick or suffering from vital injury.Leo Ikakhik, a resident in Arviat village on Canada's western Hudson Bay, is a polar bear monitor working for organisations like the World Wildlife Fund Canada . According to him, the polar bear's wretched condition is "just part of the cycle"."Mother Nature is going to do part of that... I would not really blame the climate change. It's just part of the animal, what they go through," Ikakhik said in an interview with CBC Radio One While some people refused to take the video as proof of climate change, a conservation group named SeaLegacy hoped the scene could prompt discussions on the negative influence of warming global temperatures on the Arctic and its wildlife."(The bear) was starving and we want people to know what a starving polar bear looks like, because as we lose the ice in the Arctic polar bears will starve," SeaLegacy co-founder Cristina Mittermeier told CBC Radio One on Friday.A study released in October by a climate research group at the University of Calgary suggested that Arctic Ocean could be ice-free much sooner than the previous predictions of the first ice-free Arctic summer to occur between 2040 and 2050.The consequences would be enormous for polar bears as these seal-predators' only access to food is from the surface of sea ice.

VThe talk about renewable energy is centred around its impact on global warming.\u000a\u000aThe talk about renewable energy is centred around its impact on global warming. Clean energy sources such as wind farms are key to tackling climate change. But recent research suggests something else. Global warming will significantly cut the power of the wind across northern mid-latitudes, including the US, the UK and the Mediterranean region. However, some places, including eastern Australia, will see winds pick up. It\u2019s a first of its kind global study, which talks about the impact of temperature rise on wind energy. The research has found that there will be big changes by the end of the century in many of the places hosting large numbers of turbines. According to a new research published recently in the journal Nature Geoscience, climate change in the future might cause wind resources to decline across the Northern Hemisphere. These losses could be tempered by increases in wind power potential south of the equator under severe climate change scenarios. Wind farms have grown more than fivefold in the last decade and plunging costs have made them a key way of reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning.\u000a\u000aBut in central US, for example, the power of the wind could fall by nearly a fifth. Though the findings don\u2019t disqualify wind as a competitive source of renewable energy yet the researchers do suggest that energy planners should take the future climate into account when creating long-term strategies for renewables. Wind powers only about 3.7% of worldwide energy consumption as of now, but global wind power capacity is increasing rapidly. It is growing at about 20% a year. In the latest study, researchers used an international set of climate model outputs to assess changes in wind energy resources across the globe. The team then used a \u2018power curve\u2019 from the wind energy industry to convert predictions of global winds, density and temperature into an estimate of wind energy production potential. While not all of the climate models agreed on what the future will bring, substantial changes may be in store, especially a prominent asymmetry in wind power potential across the globe.\u000a\u000aLosses of wind energy stretched from central US to the UK, Russia and Japan for both medium- and high-emissions scenarios. If carbon dioxide emissions continue at high levels, wind power resources may decrease in the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s mid-latitudes and increase in the Southern Hemisphere and tropics by 2100. It\u2019s already known that climate change can affect global wind patterns. One reason winds exist is because certain parts of the planet receive different levels of solar radiation. The result is varying levels of atmospheric pressure around the planet, which affects the way air flows from one place to another around the world. So scientists are well aware that changes in global temperatures may affect the flow of air around the planet. These changes in global temperatures, particularly those changes which are occurring faster in some regions, like the Arctic, than in others will have a bigger impact. They could have a big impact on the amount of power wind turbines are able to produce from the air flowing around them. For example, the American Midwest has several hundred wind farms with tens of thousands of wind turbines. The new research shows that wind power production in this area over the next 20 years would be similar to that of today, but that by the end of the century it could drop.\u000a\u000aConversely, the potential wind energy resources in north-eastern Australia could increase significantly due to the changes in the temperature. The reasons for these decreases and increases are not the same, however. Warmer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere at the North Pole weaken the temperature difference between the cold north and warmer equator, and a smaller temperature gradient means slower winds in the northern mid-latitudes. Similar wind resource decreases could occur in Japan, Mongolia and the Mediterranean by the end of this century. The reason the coastal areas would see increased wind energy is that the world\u2019s land is warming faster than the ocean and that difference is the energy source for those winds. The more the land warms, the more it increases the wind power in that area. In the northern mid-latitudes, however, the major driver of wind is the temperature difference between the Arctic and the tropics, and the Arctic is warming very rapidly, reducing that difference.\u000a\u000aIn a world which is constantly affected by global warming, harnessing more wind power in coming decades could be critical for countries trying to meet emission reduction standards set by the Paris Climate Agreement. In addition to North America, the team identified possible wind power reductions in Japan, Mongolia and the Mediterranean. This may be bad news for the Japanese, who are rapidly accelerating their wind power development. The new study results should help decision-makers across the globe to make informed decisions about where to invest in this technology.

VThe civil aviation ministry has decided to summon country heads of all European carriers flying to India over a controversial European Union (EU) tax that would be imposed on Indian carriers from January 1.It is feared that the EU-emissions trading system (ETS), which could cost domestic carriers billions of dollars in EU airspace emissions fees, would lead to an increase in global airfares to or via EU nations by as much as $50-250 (Rs 2,600-13,300)."We have decided to talk directly to the airlines," a senior aviation ministry official said. "If they tax our carriers, we will impose a similar tax on all EU carriers operating to and from India. As airlines would be the end sufferers, they should know the consequences of the EU\u2019s action."\u000a\u000a\u201cWe hope better sense prevails and the EU withdraws the tax. The EU should work with the global community in developing a global approach for tackling emissions in the airline industry,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe EU plans to tax airlines on the basis of carbon emissions. Local carriers, which fly to Europe, would need to pay taxes for landing in and taking off from European airports based on the type of aircraft. Under the ETS, airlines using EU\u2019s airspace will have to pay a fee for carbon emissions that exceed a set cap.\u000a\u000aIndia has termed the tax an \u201cextraterritorial imposition\u201d of the EU\u2019s policies on other countries and has vowed to fight it.

VMUMBAI: From January 1, carbon emissions by aircraft flying into 27 European Union (EU) countries, including the UK will be measured as the airline industry will come under the EU emission trading scheme, making carriers that exceed their carbon limit liable to pay a carbon tax\u000a\u000aThere will be no immediate impact on airfares as the tax will come into effect only after an airline has crossed its carbon emission limit as laid down by the EU. But if an alternative is not worked out by the Indian government and other countries that are opposed to this EU scheme, the one-way cost of an air ticket from India could eventually go up by about Rs 350-750, depending on the length of the trip, say industry experts. Under the scheme, emissions will be measured for the entire length of the trip, irrespective of whether the flight begins or ends at an EU airport. So, for a Mumbai-London flight, the carbon emissions will be measured from the time the aircraft starts moving in the Mumbai airport.\u000a\u000aNone of the airlines in India that fly to Europe had received any communication from EU on the carbon emission upper limit. Once an airline crosses that limit, it will need to buy carbon credits through the emission trade scheme. The Indian government has continued its fight against the scheme. A high-level meeting was held by the ministry of civil aviation (MOCA) officials with representatives from two countries on Tuesday, as MOCA continues to garner support globally against the EU scheme.

VDeutsche AG will pass on to its customers an expected 130 million euros of costs for carbon permits it needs this year under a new European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.\u000a\u000aGermany's biggest airline said on Monday it will add the costs from the ETS to its fuel surcharge, becoming the first carrier to provide details of how it plans to cope with the additional burden.\u000a\u000a"In the face of intensive competition, especially of from non-EU countries whose production is subject to emissions trading to only a small degree, will have to pass on the burden via ticket prices, as suggested by the EU," it said in a statement.\u000a\u000aHowever in the short term will not raise its existing surcharges, which it had increased last month -- to between 102 euros and 122 per flight leg for intercontinental flights and to 31 euros for domestic and European flights -- though it said at the time this was just to cover higher fuel costs.\u000a\u000aFrom this year, all airlines touching down or taking off in the EU will have to account for their CO2 emissions as part of an expansion of the world's largest carbon market.\u000a\u000aAirlines and their associations have balked at the scheme and even challenged it in court, saying it further burdened an industry already saddled with soaring fuel prices, fierce competition and national taxes.\u000a\u000aGlobal airlines group IATA has said it estimates the annual industry-wide cost of the ETS will rise to 2.8 billion euros by 2020 from 900 million this year.\u000a\u000aEurope's highest court last month backed the scheme, meaning all airlines will have to pay for emissions permits, drawing anger from the United States and China.\u000a\u000aAirlines will collectively receive in 2012 free permits amounting to 85% of the sector's total emissions, but because the limit is based on emissions over 2004 through 2006, most carriers are expected to need to buy more.\u000a\u000aLufthansa, which has said in the past that competition was too tough for airlines to pass on costs to their customers, said it will need to buy 35% of the permits it needs for 2012.

VCarbon credits are like shares that are sold in the international market with a view to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aAfter earning carbon credits through regenerative braking, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is now making profits from its second project \u2014 Modal Shifts \u2014 by successfully reducing its carbon footprint and selling the credits thus earned in the international market.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Newsline, DMRC Director (Finance) K K Saberwal said the organisation is earning a part of its income by selling carbon credits \u2014 the first Metro system in the world to reportedly achieve the feat.\u000a\u000aCarbon credits are like shares that are sold in the international market with a view to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases. One carbon credit is equal to one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent gases.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a unique aspect of DMRC \u2014 we earn by selling carbon credits. One project was already sanctioned by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But now, we are earning revenue from our second project \u2014 the Modal Shift. DMRC has been able to demonstrate that the carbon footprint of travelling by Metro is less than that caused while travelling in other modes of transport. Thus, we were able to earn carbon credits and sell them in the international market,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aCurrently, about 25 lakh people travel by the Metro, which is a non-polluting and an environment friendly system. Had the Metro not been there, these people would have travelled by cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers, which would have resulted in higher emission of greenhouse gases. Thus, the United Nations Body administering the clean development mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol has certified that the DMRC has helped reduce emissions, Saberwal said.\u000a\u000aThe income from sale of carbon credits, however, has dwindled over the years, Saberwal said. \u201cThe CERs (Certified Emission Reductions) was selling as high as $20 per certificate at one point in the carbon market. Today, it is less than a euro. The West\u2019s own attempts to reduce carbon footprints has impacted the cost of CERs. But it is still important for us as the phenomenon only proves that the DMRC is an extremely clean mode of transport.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe first project that earned the DMRC carbon credits was the \u2018regenerative braking\u2019 system under the clean development mechanism, Saberwal said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhenever our trains apply brakes, three phase-traction motors produce electrical energy which goes back into the overhead electricity lines. Accelerating trains \u2014 running on the same line \u2014 use this regenerated energy, thus saving on the overall energy use,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App

VNEW DELHI: In a special presentation on the Delhi Metro at the climate change talks in Paris, DMRC said that the system is carbon neutral, removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it contributes.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, who presented the paper at the conference, said, "DMRC is the only Metro getting carbon credits for its regenerative braking and modal shift projects."He also spoke about the revenue that DMRC was earning from the sale of carbon credits from its two greenhouse gas mitigation projects, the first of their kind in the world for the transport sector."The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has a well laid out sustainability plan for the future and the next step is to capture the positive health impacts from DMRC's operations, given the state of pollution in Delhi," said Dayal.Delhi Metro, which carries 2.7 million passengers each day at present, is the world's irst ever rail-based system to earn carbon credits. Through various measures, DMRC has reduced emissions by 1,03,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2012-13. By 2013-14, emission reduction had touched 1,57,000 tonnes.The agency is targeting a sa vings of 26.60 million tonnes by 2031."The main works under aken for GHG mitigation are under the categories of energy-efficient buildings, use of solar energy and Metro operations. DMRC is currently using 150 MW of power, while we have already commissioned a 3 MW plant and awar ded contracts for another 8 MW. By 2021, we will take this up to 50 MW. Other works undertaken include preserva ion of top soil, monitoring of air and noise pollution, dust collection, tree plantation, water recharge, and wheel washing," said sources.With all its new stations being built as 'green buildings', DMRC is recording 3035% savings in energy and a 50% reduction in lighting po wer density .

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aEvery commuter who chooses the Delhi Metro over a car or a bus contributes in reduction in emission of roughly 100 mg of carbon dioxide for every trip of 10 kilometres. Noting the contribution made by metro commuters to reduce global warming, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), that has funded the Delhi Metro, has urged every citizen who has not taken the metro yet to do so on World Environment Day and contribute directly towards saving the environment.\u000a\u000aThe Delhi Metro has helped remove 1.2 lakh vehicles from city roads daily and has cut 1.06 lakh tonnes of fuel consumption annually. \u201cDelhi Metro has greatly contributed towards alleviating overcrowding on the roads and sufferings of daily commuters of the city. It has led to reduction of large number of vehicles on the roads, thus positively contributing towards reducing pollution,\u201d said a JICA statement.\u000a\u000aFurther, the Delhi Metro has saved Rs.1.4 crore in fuel costs daily and has reduced green house gas emission by 6.3 lakh tonnes annually.\u000a\u000aIt has also been certified by the United Nations as the first metro system in the world which will get carbon credits for reducing emission of harmful gases and thus curbing global warming.

VThree lakh electric vehicles on the roads by 2020 would mean a reduction of over 16 lakh metric tons of pollution and savings of over Rs 3,700 crore in foreign exchange over the same period.\u000a\u000aGo Green\u2019 is the motto for all leading economies of the world, as reflected by the increasing focus on electric vehicles. US President has envisioned a target of one million electric cars on US roads by 2015 and allocated USD 2.4 billion to boost the development of electric vehicles. Almost 17 European Union nations including UK, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain provide specific tax rebates to promote usage of electric cars. China has also joined the green initiative and has plans to produce one million electric vehicles annually by 2015. However in India, we are still testing the waters to understand the sustainability of these vehicles in the long run.\u000a\u000aThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has been the frontrunner in taking initiatives for promotion and adoption of electric vehicles. In November 2010, the ministry formulated the Alternative Fuels for Surface Transportation Programme under which it provided 20 per cent subsidy to the manufacturers. The Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh also announced the formulation of an apex body, the National Council for Electric Mobility (NCEM) which would have representation by various ministries to devise a holistic policy for promotion of electric vehicles in the country.\u000a\u000aIt is expected that under this initiative, the government will make regulations specific to financial incentives for manufacturers, parking and toll benefits to customers and research and development grants to build next generation technologies. The Department of Heavy Industries is leading the initiative with Ministry of Urban Development, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Environment and Forests being the other bodies involved.\u000a\u000aThe key objective of the is to provide sustainable electric mobility to make electric vehicles a viable alternate vehicle by ensuring adequate support infrastructure for sufficient dissemination of electric vehicles. The Union Budget also proposed full exemption from basic customs duty and a concessional rate of excise duty on batteries imported by electric vehicles manufacturers. All these recent developments highlight the growing emphasis of Indian government on encouraging the growth of electric vehicles.\u000a\u000aThere is a need to develop India as a market which is currently at a nascent stage with being the only player in the electric vehicles space. Since inception of Reva Electric Car Company in 2001, till 2011, it had total sales of 5,000 cars with nearly 50 per cent domestic sales. Reva is a very well established player globally and currently sells to about 24 countries and is looking to begin distribution in 40-50 countries in 2012. Other players who ventured the Indian market with hybrid technologies include Honda with Civic Hybrid and Toyota with Prius. was not very successful since the product acceptability and consumer awareness was low during the time of launch in 2008. The Toyota Prius, which was launched in 2010, has had a slow market response owing to the current price.\u000a\u000aThe main advantage of electric vehicles besides low pollution is that running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower vis--vis conventional vehicle. Also increasing crude oil prices are driving demand for these vehicles. Electric vehicles are becoming popular among housewives and students who don\u2019t have stringent commuting requirements. Once the supportive government policies are formulated the market for these vehicles would become developed. Besides, India also has the maximum market potential owing to an established auto component infrastructure, low manufacturing and R&D costs, mechanical hardware availability, high urban congestion and the presence of a large domestic market.\u000a\u000aPrice positioning is the main concern for electric and hybrid vehicles, owing to the expensive battery costs. Reva is priced at a price point which is comparable to other petrol-driven A-segment cars while similarly is positioned in a price category which falls in the luxury segment. The high price combined with low consumer awareness and environmental sensitivity is leading to the big question on whether India is ready for such vehicles. In fact, most manufacturers are planning to launch vehicles in other countries or have already launched electric cars globally like Nissan with Leaf and Mitsubishi with iMiEV. However, they are playing it safe in India by watching the government movements and would eventually target Indian market only if the policies formulated under National Council for Electric Mobility are favorable.\u000a\u000aBesides price, infrastructure is also another concern for electric vehicles in India. Since these cars can run approximately 80 km on one charge, they are recommended for short distances as charging infrastructure is not developed in the country. There have been initiatives under which BSES in Delhi established charging ports in 50 locations across its sub-stations in the city. Likewise in Bangalore, parking spaces in malls and offices have been equipped with charging points for electric cars. However, it is important to develop rapid charging stations which can provide quick charging in lesser time.\u000a\u000aThe key challenge here is that for a developing country like India where we are struggling to deal with problem of electricity shortage, do we have enough resources to build charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Also it is difficult to assess in the long run, if we are trying to reduce the carbon footprint by decreasing the fuel-driven vehicles, or on the contrary are we burning more coal in the thermal stations to generate the required electricity for charging these vehicles. As per statistics in India, transport contributes to 7 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions while electricity contributes to 35 per cent.\u000a\u000aCustomer perception and outlook further pose the challenge of product acceptability in India. Electric vehicles are perceived to be under powered vehicles at higher cost. The cars can only cover short distance of about 80 km per charge and hence the value proposition for electric vehicle as a first car is also currently non-existent as compared to the petrol vehicle.\u000a\u000aThe whole phenomenon of electric vehicles have picked up in the recent years owing to the increasing oil prices and pressure on developed nations to reduce the carbon footprint. It is interesting to note that electric vehicles were introduced in 1830s while back in 1900, a majority of the total vehicles in the US and the UK were electricity based. Thus it is certainly a case of reinventing the wheel with India still gearing up to join the green drive.\u000a\u000aGlobally, smart cities are being developed which are focused on promoting electric vehicles usage. Indian government is also planning four smart cities in Manesar, Shendra, Changodar and Dahej to be built along the Dedicated Freight Corridor. These cities are being designed in association with Japanese firms like Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Toshiba and would be would be based on successful models of Japanese cities Kitakyushu, Toyota City and Yokohoma.\u000a\u000aSmart cities are going to be built under the main objective of 3-Rs: Recycle, Reuse and Reduce. It would focus on promoting energy-efficient facilities with networking function along with environmentally friendly public transportation system and personal vehicles. Special purpose companies would be established for project implementation, operation, maintenance and of smart cities. Japanese corporations such as Hitachi, Mitsubishi, JGC Corp and Toshiba are working along with State and Central governments to design and build these eco-friendly smart cities.\u000a\u000aBy 2020, India\u2019s population in cities is expected to grow manifold to a staggering 200 million while pollution is expected to grow by five times as compared to 2010. With this tremendous growth has emerged a very critical issue of keeping air and noise pollution in urban areas under control. It is desired to have 3 lakh electric vehicles on the roads by 2020, including three-wheelers, cars, and scooters which could result in a reduction of over 16 lakh metric tons of pollution by 2020, savings of over Rs 3,700 crore in foreign exchange and significant health costs savings.\u000a\u000aGovernment initiatives are going to be one of the major drivers for bridging the gaps between consumers and electric cars manufacturers. Reduction in cost of vehicles and providing special benefits of parking, charging infrastructure and rebates would boost the adoption of these vehicles in future.

VCHANDIGARH: As part of the plan to develop Chandigarh into a solar city , UT administration has decided to set up a solar cell , which would provide consultancy to departments for adding features of tapping solar energy in upcoming buildings. The cell will work for the development for renewable energy projects and energy conservation programmes.The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has prepared master action plan for transforming Chandigarh into a solar city. The draft report submitted by TERI has recommended energy efficiency measures of 20% for both residential and commercial sectors.The project will be mutually funded by Government of India (GoI) with a matching grant by the administration or Chandigarh municipal corporation, whoever takes up the project. Once the project takes-off, the city will become a model solar city deriving substantial percentage of its energy consumption through renewable energy sources and implementing other energy efficiency measures.Apart from recommending setting up of solar cells, the report has given broad recommendations for setting up a grid-based 25 Mega Watts solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in segment model by putting up panels in city's 12 gardens, bigger than 18 acre in area.The idea is to generate solar energy by putting up panels in open in the various gardens of the city and then uploading the power to the main grid.The electricity consumption in Chandigarh has increased manifold and once the system is put in place, solar-based electricity can be increased gradually. Since there is already a well-knit set up of wires across the city, there is no need to have a parallel network for solar energy and it can be added to the main grid.Under the solar photovoltaic energy programme street lights, indoor lights or portable lighting systems called solar lanterns have been put in different parts of the city as a renewable and pollution free alternative.Solar photovoltaic technology converts the solar energy into electricity and the capacity of the system can be increased or decreased as per the requirement. The installation of these is also very less time consuming.

VIndia could consider taking retaliatory action against the European Union for imposing a carbon tax on airlines operating from India. On the other hand, India will again try to build pressure on EU for withdrawal of the carbon tax when over 20 nations meet in Moscow on February 20 to discuss the issue.\u000a\u000aA senior Government official told Business Line, \u201cImposing some conditions on the European Carrier is one of the views being examined.\u201d Although he refuses to divulge the details, but retaliatory action could be on the similar line. The 27-member European Union has asked all airlines flying in and out of to meet a specific carbon emission requirement, otherwise they will have to pay tax under EU ETS (Emission Trading System).\u000a\u000aThe present operations of Indian carriers to the EU are unlikely to be affected by the imposition of the new tax, but any additional flights to existing or new destinations could run into trouble, he added. At present, Air India and Jet Airways fly to EU countries along with Kingfisher which flies only to the UK. The Civil Aviation Ministry has also asked Indian carriers not to respond individually to any missive from the EU on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe carriers were asked to approach the Government so that a collective India stance could be presented to the EU. Meanwhile, European carriers have told the Indian Government that they have already bought credit worth \u20ac90,000. Meanwhile, India will take the campaign forward in Moscow.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe number of countries protesting the imposition is growing. What is encouraging is that some African countries are also likely to join the ranks of countries protesting the move,\u201d the official said. This meeting is expected to be attended by China and the US.\u000a\u000aEarlier, on September 30 last year, India led 25 other countries to issue the \u2018Delhi Declaration'. The Declaration opposed the EU's plan by saying that it is inconsistent with applicable international law. It urged the EU and its member-States to refrain from including flights by non-EU carriers to/from an airport in the territory of an EU member-State in its emissions trading system. It also urged the EU and its Member States to work collaboratively with the rest of the international community to address aviation emissions.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the Joint Declaration, it was planned to send draft demarche to the EU bilaterally by the nations was also discussed, in which it was highlighted that the EUs approach under the directive is unacceptable and that there is a need to foster development of a full range of solutions that achieve performance, improvements rather than insist on imposing one nation's or region's particular solution on all other countries.\u000a\u000a>ashphadnis@thehindu.co.in

VThe Union ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) is in the eye of a storm over allotment of power plants under the National Solar Mission, in the first batch of its ambitious plans to install 20,000 Mw of grid-connected solar power by 2022.\u000a\u000aThe Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has, after field investigation, made detailed charges of distribution of projects worth Rs 13,000 crore to bidders last year being rigged to favour some companies, in violation of the guidelines. It has accused infrastructure company Infratech of grabbing many of the projects under the garb of nine different entities.\u000a\u000aCSE investigators led by deputy director general found the plant sites of all these converging at the same plot in a village in Rajasthan\u2019s Jaisalmer district. \u201cIt could be all a coincidence,\u201d says CSE director-general Sunita Narain, without suppressing a chuckle, narrating what she says has been a thoroughly enjoyable exercise of investigation. But everyone in the village of Askandra in Jaisalmer, as well as people in the state government which has given subsidised land to Lanco, knew the site of the power plants belonged to the latter, says Bhushan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLanco: The lowdown\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInfratech, the flagship company of Group, was floated in 1986 by Rajagopal Lagadapati, Member of Parliament from Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh. Lagadapati is Lanco\u2019s chairperson and his brother Lagadapati Madhusudan Rao is executive chairperson. Lanco started with construction contracts and then ventured into infrastructure and power. It competes with Tata Power for the status of largest private power producer in India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSource: DOWN TO EARTH\u000a\u000aThe ministry says it is not fully convinced about the accusations. A senior official, defending the company, said original bidders were allowed to transfer up to 49 per cent of shares to another company. And, Lanco does not have more than that. Lanco has issued a denial of the allegations. It said: \u201cEquity participation of Lanco is within the permissible level allowed and these facts were also reported in Lanco Infratech\u2019s annual report. There is no illegality involved as reported by CSE.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt said it had already given the information to NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, which conducted the bidding process. Further justifying its role, it said: \u201cIt is important to note that the bidders who Lanco supported were able to bid at one of the lowest tariffs (rates), as Lanco provided them the latest technology and complete EPC (engineering-procurement-construction) solutions for the projects. As the power purchase agreements for these projects are for 25 years, Lanco\u2019s equity participation in these projects also brings confidence to the bidder to use our technology and EPC solutions in arriving at such a competitive tariff.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, CSE asserts that Lanco has 99 per cent ownership in these through preferential shares. Not desirable because it was smothering competitors and usurping a whole new market, creating a monopoly, said Narain.\u000a\u000aThe had sprouted just days before the deadline for the bids last year, and all of them had no assets to show for net worth. They depended on shares transferred by Lanco to qualify for the bidding process, says Bhushan. The directors of some of the companies were employees of Lanco, with two of the directors found to be teenaged children of a Lanco worker, identified by CSE through their Facebook accounts.\u000a\u000aThe National Solar Mission guidelines require that the bidding company had to be worth Rs 15 crore for setting up a solar photovoltaic project and Rs 220 crore for a solar thermal project. Lanco holds shares worth Rs 15.2 crore in each PV project and Rs 221.7 crore in each solar thermal project, which matches almost exactly the net worth needed for the projects, says CSE.\u000a\u000aThe guidelines also allowed one company to bid for and win only one 100 Mw solar thermal and one five-Mw solar PV project. Of the 1,000 Mw of solar power that was to be generated in the first phase of the mission, Lanco has bagged 235 Mw of the allocation and an assured revenue of Rs 13,000 crore, based on the guaranteed feed-in rate being paid to solar projects in the first phase, says CSE.\u000a\u000aThe companies which won the bids and were found to be floated by Lanco included Khaya Solar Projects, DDE Renewables, Electromech Maritech, KVK Energy Ventures, Newton Solar, Vasavi Solar Saidham Overseas and Finehope Allied Energy. They showed their net worth by share transfer, by issuing \u2018preference shares\u2019\u2019, worth Rs 15.2 crore on the same day, December 31, 2010.\u000a\u000aThese shares were compulsorily convertible, says These would turn into normal shares after two to three years. It means Lanco had 99 per cent shares in all these companies it floated, without appearing to be so, he said. Even with preferential shares, Lanco would have only 49 per cent, a ministry official told Business Standard. Adding that if the guidelines were found to have been violated, penalties were sure to follow.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aAncient bison bones discovered at a Canadian goldmine are helping unravel the mystery about how animals adapt to rapid environmental change, a study reveals.\u000a\u000aThe 30,000-year-old bones were unearthed by University of Adelaide researchers, which helped them analyse special genetic modifications (epigenetic changes) that turn genes on and off without altering the DNA sequence itself.\u000a\u000aEpigenetic changes can occur rapidly between generations, even without going through standard evolutionary processes. Such epigenetic modifications (the effect of environment on genes) could explain how animal species are able to respond to rapid climate change.\u000a\u000aVictor Chang Cardiac Research Institute researchers, collaborating with University of Adelaide's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) have shown that it is possible to accurately measure epigenetic modifications in extinct animals and populations, the journal PLoS ONE reported.\u000a\u000aThey measured epigenetic modifications in 30,000-year-old permafrost bones from the Yukon region in Canada, and compared them to those in modern-day cattle, and a 30-year-old mummified cow from New Zealand, a university statement said. This is the first step towards testing the idea that epigenetics has driven evolution in natural populations.

VVARANASI: "Oceans and climate are linked to each other. Far from the static, Atlantic Ocean contributes a lot to climate change," shared Prof A D Singh, department of geology, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). He has returned recently from an ocean expedition to Atlantic Ocean.\u000a\u000aSingh, who was invited by the Unites States Implementing Organisation (USIO) through the Ministry of Earth Sciences India (IODP-India) to participate as one of the shipboard scientists in the International Ocean Drilling Programme (IODP-399), Mediterranean Outflow Expedition said: "Many large currents flow beneath the ocean at different depths and together these currents form a global conveyer belt that transfers heat and buffer Earth's temperature or climate," said Singh.\u000a\u000aAccording to him, water of Mediterranean Sea is saltier and denser than Atlantic Ocean and therefore it plunges more than 1000 metre down slope, building up mountains of mud at the Strait of Gibraltar, the gateway where the Mediterranean Sea enters Atlantic Ocean that holds a record of climate change and tectonic activity that spans much of the past 5.3 million years. The circulations generated at Strait of Gibraltar passes through Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean and have great record of climate change.\u000a\u000aAnother key discovery at the expedition was related to oil and natural gas exploration. The team of 35 scientists under expedition's scientific leaders Prof Dorrik Stow (UK) and Javier Hernandez-Molina (Spain) also researched on the contourites deposits at the Strait of Gibraltar that are deposits of rocks that have been deposited by the ocean current in the ocean bed. "These contourites are highly rich in hydrocarbons and gas hydrates and it is believed they can confirm their use as fuel in future. Scientists onboard the highly advanced JOIDES Resolution to drill the 8,000 metre of holes into the deep sea floor at seven different sites in the Gulf of Cadiz and on the west Portuguese continental margin. While working at the sea floor, we also witnessed the leakage of some gas hydrates," informed Singh.\u000a\u000aSingh is the second geologists from India who has been a part of a sea drilling project. Prof M S Srinivasan of BHU was the first scientist to be a part of Deep Sea Drilling Project in early 80s. In the expedition scheduled from November 18, 2011 to January 17, Singh along with eminent scientists from 13 countries (including the US, France, Germany, Japan, UK, Australia, China) spent two months at Atlantic Ocean and carried out research on global climate change and explored marine energy resources.

VThe Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, on Thursday said there appeared to be a \u201clack of collective global will\u201d to solve the problem of climate change, which could not be fought individually.\u000a\u000a\u201c...it is necessary to recognise that currently there appears to be a lack of collective global will to address this problem with the seriousness it deserves,\u201d he said at the inauguration of the 12th edition of the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit organised by TERI.\u000a\u000aNoting that the per capita emission in developed countries was 10 to 12 times than that of those in developing countries, Dr Singh said it was necessary to cut total emissions, but a way must be found so that countries are not deprived of their right to develop.\u000a\u000aHe said India was committed to the cause of sustainable development and would play a constructive role to ensure that a \u201cfair and equitable\u2019\u2019 agreement is reached at globally.\u000a\u000aRecalling the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, he said it had stated that the right to development must be fulfilled to equitably meet the needs of present and future generations. It also recognised that eradicating poverty was an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.\u000a\u000aTowards this, India\u2019s Twelfth Plan was being designed to ensure significant benefits for climate change along with inclusive and sustainable development, he said.\u000a\u000aTiger population\u000a\u000aDr Singh also announced the \u201cheart-warming news\u201d that India's tiger population is on the rise. He said the 2011 tiger census showed a 20 per cent rise in the number of tigers over 2006.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have estimated that there are today around 1,700 wild tigers in India out of a global population of around 3,000. I hope that the lessons learnt will be used to conserve other endangered species as well,\u2019\u2019 he added.\u000a\u000aForest cover\u000a\u000aIndia's forest cover, too, had gone up by nearly 5 per cent between 1997 and 2007, with a small decrease since then. \u201cWe hope to see further accretion with the implementation of the Green India Mission which aims to increase the forest and tree cover by 5 million hectares and improve forest cover on another 5 million hectares,\u2019\u2019 he added.\u000a\u000aEarlier, the Prime Minister gave away this year\u2019s Sustainable Development Leadership Award to the President of Finland, Ms Tarja Halonen.

We know that total emissions in the world must decline,but what does this imply for emissions in individual countries? We must find a way of solving this problem in a way that does not deprive developing countries of their right to develop.\u000a\u000aHe referred to the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which provide the basis for creating a workable framework for a successful,rule-based,equitable and multilateral response to issues relating to climate change.\u000a\u000aIndia will play a constructive role in the ongoing negotiations and we will certainly live up to whatever obligations fall upon us as part of a fair and equitable agreement, Singh said.\u000a\u000aWe hope to build a strategy for the Twelfth Five Year Plan which begins in April this year and it will be designed to ensure significant benefits for climate along with inclusive sustainable growth. Food and energy security and sustainable use of scarce natural resources will constitute important constituents of our strategy for sustainable development. We will seek to reduce the emissions intensity of our GDP by 20-25 percent by the year 2020 taking 2005 as the reference level, he said.\u000a\u000aHollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger,who served as Governor of California from 2003 until 2011,told delegates that he wished to make a significant contribution as a crusader for environment the same way he did for fitness.\u000a\u000aI began to weight train at the age of 15 and was awarded the title of Mr Universe at 20.

VPUNE: The sharp and sudden drop in temperature in the second week of February has caused damage to grape and banana cultivations and vegetable crop in Nashik, Pune, Aurangabad and Osmanabad districts.\u000a\u000aPlantations and crops on 1,689 hectares in the four districts have reported more than 50% damage. Grape farms on 34 hectares have also been adversely affected including cracking of grape beads. This has been revealed in an analysis report of the state horticulture department.\u000a\u000aPlantations and crops on 20,775 hectares have reported less than 50% damage, of which 1,913 hectares are under grape cultivation, said D G Bakwad, director, state horticulture department.\u000a\u000a"The temperature dropped by about 8 degrees celsius to 2.8 degrees celsius in Nashik district last Thursday. Jalgaon, which is the largest banana-producing district in the country, also recorded a sudden drop in temperature affecting banana plantations that will result in lower yields\u000a\u000a," he added.\u000a\u000aGrape is an important crop in the state that gives higher returns to farmers.\u000a\u000aThe grape export market in Maharashtra is worth more than Rs 500 crore, hence farmers are more concerned about damage\u000a\u000as to grape farms\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000aBakwad said, "It was so cold that most grape bunches developed cracks and farmers lost the plants. The leaves, which prepare food through photosynthesis, were damaged so badly that the photosynthesis procedure could not take place and the plant cannot produce grapes now. It is the same with banana plantations and other vegetables, where leaves have been badly damaged affecting the yield from the farm."\u000a\u000aThe temperature continued to be low for the next couple of days and the area suffering damage to crops increased in these districts. Compared to vegetables, investment in grape farms runs in lakhs and hence the loss due to damage is also high\u000a\u000a. One hectare of grape plantation needs investment of Rs 1 crore and above including cost of iron rods, cables, saplings, fertilisers, pesticides and human labour\u000a\u000a.Bakwad said, "A report would be submitted to the state agriculture department for further action. Temperature is expected to fall in the coming days, according to the weather department. If it happens, there will be more damage to these crops. Though farmers cover the compound wall of grapes with old saris to maintain some warmth, it is not a reliable method."

VNEW DELHI: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has told chief climate negotiators of South Africa, Brazil and China that \u2018equity\u2019 and the principle of \u2018common but differentiated responsibilities\u2019 will remain central to India\u2019s stance at the UN talks as the world negotiates a post-2020 climate regime. He also said India would continue to work closely with the BASIC nations and the developing countries group of G77+China.The chief negotiators met Singh during their visit to Delhi for the meeting of BASIC countries. The signal from the PM was translated into the joint communique by the four countries after the meeting which concluded on February 14. The statement read, \u201cThey reaffirmed that the process launched at Durban is not to renegotiate or rewrite the convention and that this process and its outcome shall be under the convention and in full accordance with all its principles and provisions, in particular the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.\u201dSources told TOI that the three nations also appreciated the role played by environment and forests minister Jayanthi Natarajan at the Durban meet. Her clear stance had stitched a closer alliance, especially with China, and kept the BASIC group intact despite some internal diversions and ensured that India\u2019s agenda and red lines were not crossed at the climate meet in December last year.At the BASIC meeting in Delhi, they came out in full support of the PM and the minister\u2019s views on equity and in order to quell any doubts stated that the new regime would only come up under the existing convention which already enshrines these principles.The four countries also raised the bar for EU by linking any future talks on a new regime under what is called the \u2018Durban Platform\u2019 to the developed countries turning their commitments given at Durban into exact targets for emission reductions by May 2012.In a hint that the rest of the talks running through 2012 could be jeopardized unless the EU and other developed countries took \u2018economy wide quantified emission reduction objectives\u2019, the four warned that such targets were the first step to future talks.They also took a strong view against the unilateral EU carbon tax on aviation and said such a move \u201cwould seriously jeopardize the international efforts to combat climate change\u201d.Sources at the meeting said all four countries had firmly opposed the aviation tax EU had threatened to impose and it could create an impasse at the UN climate talks.The meeting of the four BASIC members was critical as all countries are expected to submit their formal notes to the UN on how the talks under \u2018Durban Platform\u2019 for the post-2020 climate regime should be framed.

VMANALI: Contrary to the heavy snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, the snow desert of the state -- Lahaul-Spiti -- has received negligible snow this year, triggering global warming fears in the Himalayan regions. Minimum 15 feet of snowfall is normal in the district every year but it did not snow beyond 5 feet this time.\u000a\u000aAccording to residents, they had been noticing a drop in density of snowfall since late 70s. "Our ancestors had started celebrating Fagli festival in February wherein all family and relatives met and made sure they could cope with the harsh winters. But now things have changed," said a resident of Pattan valley, Balbir Kirpu. It is surprising that other areas of Himachal, south of the Rohtang Pass, have received thick snowfall, some after 50-60 years.\u000a\u000aTashi Angrup of the valley said, "The transportation was never affected and all internal routes in Lahaul are clear of snow. This is very strange."\u000a\u000aExperts say that such climate changes are taking place due to global warming. A scientist at Govind Ballabh\u000a\u000aPant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development, Dr J C Kuniyal, said, "It is the environment imbalance that caused variations in snowfall. Increasing population, arbitrary construction and pollution can be the reason."\u000a\u000aKuniyal and his team are studying the changing behaviour of aerosol particles suspended in the air, for many years. Aerosols are responsible for warming or cooling of the atmosphere. He said the pollution has increased the heat absorption capacity of the aerosol causing global warming.

India has termed the tax as "unilateral" and an "extraterritorial imposition" of the EU's policies on other countries.\u000a\u000a"If you don't have a global scheme you will end up with piecemeal imposition of different structures all around the world, which will be impossible to deal with and almost impossible to explain to a passenger that there is a European tax, an Indian tax, a US tax," she said.

VKOLKATA: The West Bengal government's move to extend the national grid to the Sundarbans delta for electrifying villages has come in for criticism from environmentalists.\u000a\u000a"The land is soft and setting up large and heavy transmission poles may lead to greater erosion, and change the tidal patterns when installed in rivers and creeks," S P Gon Chaudhuri, former director of West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Limited (WBGEDCL), told PTI.\u000a\u000aThese transmission lines will also be vulnerable to cyclones that hit the region regularly, he said, adding the option of tapping renewable energy resources should be looked into.\u000a\u000aNew Delhi-based research body Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had noted in its recent report that "In this inter-tidal deltaic and cyclone-prone region, it is difficult to extend and maintain electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) lines from the mainland and islands due to the wide water channels".\u000a\u000aThe West Bengal government has planned to extend the grid-based electricity to the whole of Sundarbans, declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. About 1076 villages are supposed to be covered under this plan.\u000a\u000aThe per capita consumption of electricity in the Sundarbans is less than 50 kwh/year, about 96 per cent of which is supplied through grid.\u000a\u000aAnother problem with grid-based electricity is its irregularity and unpredictability, the report said, adding of the villages that receive power, 85 per cent face daily power cuts for four-nine hours.\u000a\u000aRevenues for electricity distributors are also low as a large number of households are in the BPL category, the settlements are dispersed and due to absence of commercial users of electricity, the CSE study observes.\u000a\u000aNot only does the quality of electric supply gets reduced in such circumstances, but the cost of distribution is also high.\u000a\u000aAccording to estimates by the Sundarbans Development Board in 2010, the demand for electricity in the region is expected to grow 10 to 20 fold between 2010 and 2020.\u000a\u000aThe state-owned renewable energy agency WBGEDCL has estimated that an investment of Rs 1246.43 crore in transmission and distribution will be required for electrification in the area.\u000a\u000aThe CSE report says a hybrid combination of different renewable energy sources including solar photovoltaic, biomass boiler turbine generators, bio diesel and biomass gasifiers, will electrify the delta at an approximate cost of Rs 2500 crore.\u000a\u000aThe Sundarbans have a potential of generating 2250 MW of solar power and 450 MW of wind energy in the tidal mangroves.\u000a\u000aRenewable energy, say experts, might hold the key to the delta's power concerns.\u000a\u000a"The costs will, in fact, be far cheaper compared to the grid generation and distribution combined," says Gon Chaudhuri. He suggests that the best way forward would be to look for hybrid solutions.\u000a\u000a"The islands should have decentralised power from renewable sources, while the areas connected to the mainland should have grid connection," he says.

VNEW DELHI: For the first time, the government has set down the framework and reasoning behind its stance on future climate talks in a policy document \u2013 the Economic Survey. Firmly embedding equity and the principle of \u2018common but differentiated responsibility\u2019 at the heart of its negotiations for a post-2020 global regime, the Economic Survey said, \u201cThe post-2020 arrangements to be evolved under the Durban Platform have to be anchored in the principles of equity and CBDR.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a rare departure, the survey report outlined and explained an element of India\u2019s international policy detailing why it had to place equity at the heart of its stance to ensure atmospheric space for growth even as it took on a substantial financial burden domestically to meet its voluntary commitments like the Solar Mission. The economic as well as scientific logic underpinning the principles was sketched out in the survey.The 20-page chapter on climate change left no doubt that the alternative view floating inside the government for the past some years of showing flexibility on these basic principles has now been effectively shelved.The Economic Survey also ripped into the stance taken by the small island countries such as Grenada and Tuvalu \u2013 who play the \u2018victim card\u2019 to the hilt at the negotiations while aligning with developed country blocs such as the EU on critical junctures. It noted how several of these countries had much greater income, energy and emission levels than India while India had a substantially larger population at risk from climate change. The survey was also critical of a recent report commissioned by the UN secretary-general on climate finance for being silent on several critical issues and being contrary to the provisions of the existing UN climate convention.The survey noted that despite many developed countries reneging on their existing obligations on emission reduction, finance and technology transfer, India had undertaken voluntary actions to reduce energy intensity of its economy at considerable economic cost even as it spent a high amount on adaptation. It recognised that more was needed to help shift the energy sources and distribution to a more equitable level domestically. Full Coverage on Budget 2012: Budget 2012\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VPeople enjoy the sun in Paris. (AFP) March 29: Some people call what has been happening the last few years \u201cweather weirding\u201d, and March is turning out to be a fine example. As a surreal heat wave was peaking across much of America last week, pools and beaches drew crowds, some farmers planted their crops six weeks early, and trees burst into bloom. \u201cThe trees said: \u2018Aha! Let\u2019s get going!\u2019\u201d said Peter Purinton, a maple syrup producer in Vermont. \u201c\u2018Spring is here!\u2019\u201d Now, of course, a cold snap in the northern states of America has brought some of the lowest temperatures of the season, with damage to tree crops alone likely to be in the millions of dollars. Lurching from one weather extreme to another seems to have become routine across the northern hemisphere. Parts of the US may be shivering now, but Scotland is setting heat records. Across Europe, people died by the hundreds during a severe cold wave in the first half of February, but a week later revellers in Paris were strolling down the Champs-lyses in their shirt-sleeves. Does science have a clue what is going on? The short answer appears to be: not quite. The longer answer is that researchers are developing theories that, should they withstand critical scrutiny, may tie at least some of the erratic weather to global warming. Specifically, suspicion is focused these days on the drastic decline of sea ice in the Arctic, which is believed to be a direct consequence of the human release of greenhouse gases. \u201cThe question really is not whether the loss of the sea ice can be affecting the atmospheric circulation on a large scale,\u201d said Jennifer A. Francis, a Rutgers University climate researcher. \u201cThe question is, how can it not be, and what are the mechanisms?\u201d Some aspects of the climate situation are clear from earlier research. As the planet warms, many scientists say, more energy and water vapour are entering the atmosphere and driving weather systems. \u201cThe reason you have a clothes dryer that heats the air is that warm air can evaporate water more easily,\u201d said Thomas C. Peterson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A report released yesterday by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN body that issues periodic updates on climate science, confirmed that a strong body of evidence links global warming to an increase in heat waves, a rise in episodes of heavy rainfall and other precipitation, and more frequent coastal flooding. \u201cA changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events,\u201d the report found. Some of the documented imbalances in the climate have certainly become remarkable. US government scientists recently reported, for instance, that February was the 324th consecutive month in which global temperatures exceeded their long-term average for a given month; the last month with below-average temperatures was February 1985. In the US, many more record highs are being set at weather stations than record lows, a bellwether indicator of a warming climate. So far this year, the US has set 17 new daily highs for every new daily low, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Climate Central, a research group in New Jersey. But, while the link between heat waves and global warming may be clear, the evidence is much thinner regarding some types of weather extremes.

The move can increase freight rates by 3%-15%.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWith EU mulling a tax on the shipping industry that will impose a levy based on carbon emissions on ships entering European waters, the Indian government has prepared a policy document to examine impacts of such a move and list measures to retaliate what it sees as a unilateral move.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe government has also asked aviation sector players in India not to communicate with EU on the carbon tax it has imposed. The decision was taken after official meetings, with the aviation ministry now empowered to take progressively stronger steps to block the EU decision.EU had demanded that airlines flying into European airspace start providing data that would allow regulators to measure the carbon imprint of the flights and levying taxes at the end of the year. Sources in the government said Indian airlines were being asked to ensure that regulations against the government policy are not accepted.India, along with other key countries, like China, Brazil, the US and Russia had agreed to a basket of actions against EU if the latter does not back off. The committee of secretaries agreed to take those measures in sequential manner upgrading the offensive against EU.India has argued that imposition of carbon tax on aviation or maritime activity must adhere to the principles agreed to under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change . That would ensure that it is the manufacturers of inefficient craft that are taxed for emissions and not consumers.China has also asked its airline services to not adhere to the European regulations on carbon tax. There has also been speculation of a Chinese airline cancelling orders from the European manufacturer leading to heightened tension in the markets about an all out trade-war breaking out. India's move to also restrict its airlines from participating in the European carbon tax scheme is expected to add fuel to the fire.

VIn a new measure to check emissions responsible for global warming, the government has notified a domestic carbon trade mechanism that will impose penalties on industries failing to achieve new energy efficiency targets.\u000a\u000aNew rules notified for eight energy-intensive sectors will allow the government to impose a penalty of over Rs 10,000 for missing the target by 1 tonne of oil-equivalent. It means that if a company falls short by 5 tonnes of oil-equivalent, it will have to pay a penalty of over Rs 50,000 to the government.\u000a\u000aThere is also an incentive for companies that surpass the energy-efficiency target set for 2014-15. For each extra tonne of oil-equivalent saved, the company will get an energy saving certificate. These certificates can be sold through a market mechanism to companies that fail to meet the target.\u000a\u000aBureau for Energy Efficiency (BEE) director general Ajay Mathur told HT that the scheme would enable the Indian industry to \u201cprogressively\u201d reduce its carbon intensity, strengthening its bottom line as well. \u201cIn a way, the production cost for each tonne will reduce,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAmong the world\u2019s first domestic carbon emission trading mechanisms, this scheme \u2014 known as Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) \u2014 has been implemented under the National Mission for Energy Efficiency Enhancement. It is a part of the Prime Minister\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change.\u000a\u000aThe power ministry on Friday notified the rules under the Energy Conservation Act-2011, aimed at reducing 6.6 million tonnes of oil-equivalent by 2015, or 4% of the energy consumed by these industries in 2009-10. As the bureau wanted to target energy-intense industries, eight sectors \u2014 iron and steel, cement, fertilisers, aluminum, pulp and paper, chloralkali, textiles and thermal power stations \u2014 were included.\u000a\u000aAccounting for one-third of India\u2019s total energy consumption, these sectors cover 478 industrial units whose energy consumption for producing a tonne of end-product is higher than the standard specified by BEE. They include some of India\u2019s top companies, such as Reliance, Vedanta Aluminum Limited and Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aSome glaciers on Asia\u2019s Karakoram mountains, which is home to K2, are defying the global trend and getting thicker, a new study has claimed.\u000a\u000aFor the study, a French team used satellite data to show that glaciers in part of the Karakoram range, to the west of the Himalayan region, are putting on mass.\u000a\u000aThe reason is unclear, as glaciers in other parts of the Himalayas are losing mass, which also is the global trend.\u000a\u000aThe region\u2019s glaciers are poorly studied, yet provide a vital water source for more than a billion people.\u000a\u000aThe response of Himalayan glaciers to global warming has been a hot topic ever since the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which contained the erroneous claim that ice from most of the region could disappear by 2035.\u000a\u000aAlthough often regarded as part of the Himalayas, the Karakoram range is technically a separate chain that includes K2, the world\u2019s second-highest peak.\u000a\u000aMuch of the region is inaccessible, and there has been a general recognition that observations need to be stepped up in order to clarify what is going on.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt could be due to a very specific regional climate over Karakoram,\u201d the BBC quoted Julie Gardelle, CNRS-Grenoble as saying.\u000a\u000aThe French scientists, from the National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Grenoble, compared two models of land surface elevation derived from satellite observations, for 1999 and 2008.\u000a\u000aThe method has been used before in other mountain ranges, but it is not as straightforward as it might sound.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s not been used more because these elevation models are quite difficult to acquire -- you need clear sky conditions and reduced snow cover,\u201d Gardelle, the lead researcher, said.\u000a\u000aOther factors that can change the height of the ice surface, other than changes to the ice itself, also need to be accounted for.\u000a\u000aHaving done all these calculations, the team found that between 1999 and 2008 the mass of the glaciers in this 5,615 sq km (2,168 sq miles) region of the Karakoram increased marginally, although there were wide variations between individual glaciers.\u000a\u000aWhy this should be is not clear, though it is well known from studies in other parts of the world that climate change can cause extra precipitation into cold regions, which if they are cold enough, gets added to the existing mass of ice.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t really know the reason.\u000a\u000a\u201cRight now we believe that it could be due to a very specific regional climate over Karakoram because there have been meteorological measurements showing increased winter precipitation; but that\u2019s just a guess at this stage,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWhatever the region, it is clear that the trend contrasts with other parts of the wider Himalayas-Hindu Kush region, home to an estimated 210 million people and where glaciers act as fresh water stores for about 1.3 billion living in river basins below.\u000a\u000aThe study has been published in the Nature Geoscience journal.

VMuch has been written and discussed recently on the subject of climate change in response to growing scientific evidence that has been assessed and disseminated in recent years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC , which was completed in 2007, stated categorically that "warming of the climate system is unequivocal" and that most of the warming that had taken place since the middle of the last century was very likely the result of increase in the concentration of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The term 'very likely' in this instance conveys a probability of over 90%. Yet, most surveys of public perceptions and attitudes in the past have seemed to indicate that climate change is something that would really affect economic activities and human well-being only some time in the future. This conclusion has now to be reviewed in the light of new scientific evidence.The IPCC has recently brought out a Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (Srex). The evidence produced in this report shows that climate change has already led to changes in climate extremes, such as heatwaves, record high temperatures in many regions, and heavy precipitation in the past half century. Climate extremes, or even a series of non-extreme events, in combination with social vulnerabilities and exposure to risks, can produce climate-related disasters. Policies to avoid, prepare for, respond to and recover from the risks of disaster can reduce the impact of these events and increase the resilience of people exposed to extreme events.At the same time, adaptation alone would not be adequate as a response to deal with projected climate change in the future. In other words, tackling climate change would entail creating the capacity to adapt to these events essentially at the local level, but also mitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases at the global level. There is reason to accept that human society would sooner, rather than later, pursue such a path in response to growing understanding and awareness related to climate change.A recent poll carried out by Gallup early in March this year has found that about half of Americans, 52%, say the effects of global warming have already begun to happen, consistent with views since 2009. However, this remains down from prior years, when as many as 61% believed global warming was already manifesting itself. However, while barely half of Americans agree that the effects of global warming are already manifest, an additional 29% say the effects will start to happen within a few years (4%), sometime in their lifetime (10%) or sometime further into the future (15%). Around 15% of Americans say the effects will never happen. What is relevant is that almost two-thirds of those polled believe that climate change will happen in their respective lifetimes.Srex came up with a number of findings and some key conclusions, including (a) an observed increase in the length or number of warm spells or heatwaves in many regions of the globe, (b) increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation events or increase in proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls over many areas of the globe, particularly in the high latitudes and tropical regions, and in winter, in the northern mid-latitudes, and (c) projected increase in intensity and duration of droughts in some regions of the world.

VMUMBAI: The crash in carbon credit prices globally has served a crushing blow to companies operating in this space in India. Firms, whose business models were based purely on profit from sale of carbon credits, have either closed down or substantially downsized their operations.A carbon credit is a type of a tradable greenhouse gas emission reduction unit issued to projects under the Kyoto Protocol . One carbon credit is equivalent to one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigated. A consultant or a trader usually earns a profit from the sale of carbon credits by a manufacturer. With prices falling from around 10-12 euros per unit six-eight months ago to 3-4 euros today, the consultants\u2019 profits have slumped by one-fourth. This has forced some of these companies to down shutters.Sources said companies which have been impacted by this include Noble India, whose India carbon credit desk was closed down, and Gensol Consultants which has restructured and downsized its operations. \u201cThe entire team had to go through a lot of pain during these turbulent times. We have downsized and restructured our operations. But, thankfully, our venture capital partner has supported us through this,\u201d said Anmol Singh Jaggi, director, Gensol Consultants, which is now in the process of raising further money for its solar and power trading business.However, consultancies which had a more diverse portfolio in sustainability have managed to survive. Sudipta Das, partner (climate change and sustainability), E&Y, said the impact of the price crash on the firm was not large enough because carbon credits form a small part of the firm\u2019s sustainability division.\u201cThere was an initial rush for registering projects under the CDM (clean development mechanism) executive board to get carbon credits, but it was only when a number of applications from India were turned down that firms started facing the heat. Many have either folded up or substantially downsized their operations,\u201d said Arvind Sharma, head (climate change and sustainability services practice), KPMG India.According to Krish Krishnan Green Ventures International , one of the trends that have emerged is that a lot of consultants that were operating in the pure-play CDM space have diversified into allied segments like renewable energy and energy efficiency.Many small and medium players are even looking at business opportunities outside India in least developed countries.However, the sentiment is unlikely to improve with worst-case scenarios being presented by certain industry reports that state carbon credits could be tending towards an unthinkable \u201czero\u201d level. \u201cThe mindset of Indian companies has changed dramatically. Earlier, they were not even prepared to sell their carbon credit at 15 euros, and now they have given open mandates to sell whenever the price comes to 4 euros,\u201d said P Ram Babu, CEO, General Carbon Advisory Services.Only a few years ago, a rosy picture was being painted around the carbon credit market. As against the forecast that the business of advisory and consultancy could touch Rs 500 crore in ten years on the back of a strong carbon credit pipeline, the industry today is not even talking about reaching the halfway mark yet.

VIt\u2019s a lot like one of those math problems that gave you fits in sixth grade: a salesman leaves home in Denver and drives his electric car to a meeting in Boulder. At the same time, a physicist driving the same model electric car sets out from her loft in Los Angeles, heading to an appointment near Anaheim.\u000a\u000aFor both, the traffic is light, and the cars consume an identical amount of battery power while traveling the same number of miles. Being purely electric, they emit zero tailpipe pollutants during their trips.\u000a\u000aThe test question: Are their carbon footprints also equal?\u000a\u000aThe answer may be a surprise. According to a report that the Union of Concerned Scientists plans to release on Monday, there would be a considerable difference in the amount of greenhouse gases \u2014 primarily carbon dioxide \u2014 that result from charging the cars\u2019 battery packs. By trapping heat, greenhouse gases contribute to climate change.\u000a\u000aThe advocacy group\u2019s report, titled \u201cState of Charge: Electric Vehicles\u2019 Global Warming Emissions and Fuel Cost Savings Across the United States,\u201d uses the electric power requirements of the Nissan Leaf as a basis for comparison. The Leaf, on sale in the United States for more than a year and the most widely available electric model from a major automaker, sets a logical baseline.\u000a\u000aThe California part of the story is upbeat: a hypothetical Los Angeles Leaf would be accountable for the release of an admirably low level of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, about the same as a gasoline car getting 79 miles per gallon. But the Denver car would cause as large a load of greenhouse gases to enter the atmosphere as some versions of the gasoline-powered Mazda 3, a compact sedan rated at 33 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving by the Environmental Protection Agency. In simple terms, the effect of electric vehicles on the amount of greenhouse gases released into the environment can span a wide range, varying with the source of the electricity that charges them. California\u2019s clean power makes the Leaf a hero; the regional mix of coal-dependent utilities serving Denver diminish the car\u2019s benefits as a global-warming fighter.\u000a\u000aThe UCS report, which takes into account the full cycle of energy production, often called a well-to-wheels analysis, demonstrates that in areas where the electric utility relies on natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or renewable sources to power its generators, the potential for electric cars and plug-in hybrids to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is great. But where generators are powered by burning a high per centage of coal, electric cars may not be even as good as the latest gasoline models \u2014 and far short of the thriftiest hybrids.\u000a\u000aWith gasoline hovering around $4 a gallon and mass-production EV\u2019s like battery-powered versions of the Ford Focus and Honda Fit (as well as plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt, Toyota Prius PHV and Ford Fusion Energi models) either on sale now or coming soon, the report arrives at an ideal time. Its analysis can help shoppers make informed decisions.\u000a\u000aIt also fills a gap: many of the existing studies on electric-car efficiency were completed before models like the Leaf came to market; others have expressed their results in science-lab terms like pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year, not especially useful to consumers. Automakers have not always helped their customers understand the issues, either, typically painting electrics and hybrids with a green brush and an idealistic setting.\u000a\u000aThe attempt to forge a simple message has created mistaken impressions, too. During a discussion with business leaders and journalists at the French consulate in New York early this month, the chief executive of Nissan and Renault, Carlos Ghosn, doubled down in declaring an environmental edge for electrics over the best gasoline models.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven if you could use electricity only from coal,\u201d Ghosn said, \u201cyou\u2019re still better off using an electric car than using gasoline.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is a position that Nissan says it has held since the Leaf program began, yet the studies that the company offers in support of its position show electrics outperforming only vehicles with fuel economy ratings from about 27 to 36 miles per gallon.\u000a\u000aAssembled over nine months in 2011, the UCS report provides clarification in several ways, examining charging costs under various conditions and offering comparisons among the Leaf, the Mitsubishi \u201ci\u201d electric and the Volt plug-in hybrid. Most revealing, perhaps, is the geographical breakdown of electricity generation.\u000a\u000aIn a worst-case situation, with electric power generated from a high proportion of coal \u2014 as it is in a wide swath of the country\u2019s midsection \u2014 an electric car or a plug-in hybrid will generate slightly more full-cycle global-warming emissions, as the report calls the greenhouse gases, than the best gasoline-engine subcompact. In areas where the cleanest electricity is available \u2014 regions served by hydroelectric, natural gas or nuclear generating plants \u2014 greenhouse gas emissions may be less than half that of today\u2019s best gasoline-engine vehicles.\u000a\u000aPut another way, for 45 per cent of the United States population, an E.V. will generate lower levels of greenhouse gases than a gasoline-engine vehicle capable of 50 m.p.g. in combined city-highway driving. Cities in this group include the predictable \u2014 Seattle, for example \u2014 as well as the less obvious, like Buffalo or New Orleans.\u000a\u000aAbout 37 per cent of Americans live in regions where a Leaf\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions would equate to a gasoline-powered vehicle rated at 41 to 50 m.p.g. Some 18 per cent of the population lives in regions with a comparatively dirty power supply, where the well-to-wheels carbon footprint of a Leaf would be the equivalent of a vehicle rated at 31 to 40 m.p.g., typical of models like the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus and Hyundai Elantra.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s another way to look at it: if one region were completely dependent on coal for power, its electric cars would be responsible for full-cycle global-warming emissions equivalent to a car capable of 30 m.p.g. in mixed driving. In a region totally reliant on natural gas, an electric would be equivalent to a 50 m.p.g. gasoline-engine car.\u000a\u000aThe report divides the United States into 26 regions. Each region comprises a single interconnected electricity grid, though several utility companies may operate within a region. Because the utilities sell power among themselves, the emission levels for one city or utility cannot be pinpointed for every hour of every day, but regional analysis provides an approximation of average emissions over time.\u000a\u000aThe report\u2019s analysis is based on the E.P.A.\u2019s 2007 Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database, the most recent compilation of data available. For each region, the average amount of global-warming emissions generated to produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity was calculated, taking into account emissions resulting from the transportation of fuel to the power plant.\u000a\u000aTo convert those power plant emission levels to an m.p.g. figure, calculations were based on the power draw of the Nissan Leaf: 0.34 kilowatt-hours per mile. The Volt, which draws 0.36 kilowatt-hours per mile, requires slightly more power.\u000a\u000aThe report makes it possible to compare electrics with conventional hybrids that rely solely on a gasoline engine to charge their battery. In the dirtiest regions of the country, the hybrid would generate lower levels of full-cycle emissions than the electric car, but a breakdown of the data shows that more than half of Americans live in regions where an electric car has lower well-to-wheels carbon emissions than today\u2019s best full-hybrid vehicles, while 17 per cent live in areas where they would be equal.\u000a\u000aOf course, conventional gas-powered vehicles are getting cleaner as engineering advances improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. On the other hand, electrics and plug-ins will become cleaner without technology changes as coal-burning power plants are replaced with natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind or solar facilities.\u000a\u000aDon Anair, a senior engineer in the U.C.S. clean vehicles program, said utilities in the dirtiest electric-grid regions of the United States generate 2 .5 to 3 times more global-warming emissions than those in the cleanest regions, so there is much room for improvement. But he sees the industry trending in the right direction.\u000a\u000a\u201cA number of old coal-fired power plants are now being retired,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven emission standards recently introduced by the current administration, any new coal-fired plants would be far cleaner than their predecessors.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to 2010 data from the United States Energy Information Administration, 45 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity is generated by burning coal, the dirtiest fuel. Natural gas, a much cleaner fuel, accounts for 24 per cent of electricity production, a figure that is shifting rapidly with price swings. Nuclear plants generate 20 per cent of the nation\u2019s power, while wind, solar and geothermal sources provide 3 per cent.\u000a\u000aWhile the report puts hard numbers on the current situation, it also points out the need for fundamental changes.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo prevent the worst consequences of global warming,\u201d the report concludes, \u201cthe automotive industry must deliver viable alternatives to the oil-fueled internal-combustion engine \u2014 i.e., vehicles boasting zero or near-zero emissions.\u201d  The New York Times News Service 2012

VNEW DELHI: The fight against climate change will take a strategic jump in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-2017) with the government intending to plough in almost Rs 2 lakh crore through the various missions, the working group on climate of the 12th Five-Year Plan has said.The report seeks setting up of a dedicated structure of governance to oversee the different programmes under the 12th Plan with such large funds to be invested. The agriculture mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change alone is to spend upwards of Rs 1 lakh crore over five years to make the primary sector more resilient to inevitable changes in climate change. The report pointed out that the government already spends 2.8% of its GDP on programmes that bring adaptation benefits to people.But the expert group, headed by K Kasturirangan , which wrote the report, has warned that government should not make any further commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions without holding the widest possible consultations with ministries concerned and other stakeholders. It has asked for an inter-ministerial group to be set up to draw up strategy as the issue envelops large investment as well as strategic concerns.The government had earlier committed internationally to reduce energy intensity of the country\u2019s economy by 20-25% below 2005 levels by 2020, which the panel noted would entail huge costs for the country. The report said the total funding requirements could add up to several billion dollars and unless funds were provided by the international community, these actions were likely to have adverse impact on the country\u2019s growth and poverty eradication measures because of demands of expenditure on health, education, livelihood, security and diversion of resources from core issues to climate change.But the existing commitments made under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, such as the Solar Mission and the Green India Mission, already need substantial funding over the 12th Plan. The Green India Mission will require Rs 46,000 crore in 12th and 13th Plans. The National Mission for Himalayas requires Rs 1,500 crore and the National Water Mission requires Rs 8,900 crore by the end of the 12th Plan.The report has recommended that a separate national authority be set up for implementing the mitigation actions that would implement the domestic and international commitments made to reduce emissions and find adequate funds through all routes.The report of the sub-group, submitted at the end of 2011, has been with the Planning Commission for long with the environment ministry \u2014 the nodal agency for climate change within the government \u2014 also in the dark about the final version of recommendations that the plan panel is preparing.

VNEW DELHI: The National Solar Mission , which aims to install 20,000 MW capacity of solar energy by 2020, has commissioned 89% of its allotted capacity in its first stage, government officials said.The government had signed power purchase agreements (PPA) with 28 solar power developers for 140-MW solar photo voltaic (PV) projects in January 2011, out of which 125-MW of capacity stands commissioned currently."The progress so far is very good as most of the projects are commissioned. The delayed projects have been given one month extension with a part of their bank guarantee encashed," said Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary, ministry of new and renewable energy.For solar thermal sector , power purchase agreements were signed for 27 projects for a capacity of 470 MW in batch 1. They would be commissioned by May 2013.NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN), which executes the bidding and trades power with the developers, is satisfied with the result, which, it says could have been 100% if hiccups like allegations against Lanco and delays by some other developers had not taken place. "We are now stricter than before with the mission guidelines and will work more closely with the developers of batch 2," said a senior official of NVVN One of the major participating companies in the mission, Lanco Infratech recently faced allegations irregularities such as creating front companies. The investigative report on the matter will soon be presented, officials said."We expect to place it in a week or two. Our investigation concludes that the company did flout some guidelines but there is no scam as such, but we are more cautious with the batch 2 now," said Kapoor.The solar PV projects under batch 2 of phase 1, with the selected capacity of 340 MW, signed the PPA in January this year and will commission by February 2013. These projects are highly awaited as this round of bidding saw some big names in the solar energy market quoting tariffs as low as Rs 7.49/unit."The projects under batch 2 are under construction and we are hopeful that they will start commissioning in time," said Kapoor. The ministry also hopes to achieve grid parity in next five years. Mission statement has set a target to achieve 20,000 MW of solar generated power by 2020.The total installed capacity of solar generated power in the country stands at 503.9 MW so far. The total investment, as estimated by the ministry is about Rs 6,000 crore.

VBy Mukul Sanwal\u000a\u000aSpeaking at an international workshop on Equity and Climate Change, held on April 12, the minister for environment and forests, Jayanthi Natarajan, sought to build a consensus on the inter-relationship between equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in the Climate Convention, and the nature of the obligations they entail in the new arrangement that is to be negotiated.By focusing on a technical definition of equity the approach continues to be to tweak a failing system arrived at in 1992 rather than develop a global vision for 2032.The starting point should have been an assessment of how, despite the principles of the Convention and continuing growth of emissions in developed countries, half of humanity, which has yet to enjoy the benefits of industrialisation, urbanisation and increases in levels of income, finds itself in a situation where there is strong pressure on it to take on commitments to reduce increase in emissions of carbon dioxide. The question is whether a new paradigm is needed.Clearly, the arguments that were made in the run-up to the climate treaty in 1992, subsequently over a 20-year period, and now being repeated are flawed.We have adopted an ostrich-like attitude in clutching at the common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) principle as the global policy driver, even though it does not exist in this form. A compromise was made in the Climate Treaty in 1992, and we agreed to the addition of the words "and respective capabilities".The result is that international environmental law continues to struggle with ongoing debates over whether developing countries should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and, if so, how much financial support developed countries should provide for such efforts.The minister is right in stressing that the strategic issue for the next round of climate negotiations is a common understanding of equity. The unresolved question, however, is not defining equity, on which there is no agreement even within developing countries, but whether political decisions on equitably sharing the global commons (a new paradigm) are a precondition for agreement on a global rule-based system, or if incremental steps to develop a rule based system on the basis of the Cancun Agreements (the old paradigm) will lead to equitable outcomes.There are two widely different perspectives considering the way climate negotiations review the use of global natural resources. The environmental case is based on impact of climate change on natural ecosystems, and the assertion that the stabilisation level and timeframe for peaking of emissions is the most important global policy issue.

VWith the prices sliding of (CER) certificates traded on the international exchange, Indian holding the credits are bracing for tough times. Brokers trading in CERs have started to downsize their carbon desk and the ones holding these are looking for buyers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe demand for CERs is low, which saw the prices slide. Aggregators of credits and the intermediaries, have started feeling the heat. Some have already reduced activity in India and some of the purely trading firms have already closed shop,\u201d said Dipankar Ghosh, partner, Ernst & Young (climate change and sustainability advisory).\u000a\u000aA CER or carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit a tonne of carbon dioxide or the mass of another greenhouse gas with a carbon dioxide equivalent to a tonne of carbon dioxide. Carbon credits and carbon markets are a component of national and international attempts under the to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs).\u000a\u000aGreenhouse gas emissions are capped and markets are used to allocate the emissions among the group of regulated sources. The goal is to allow market mechanisms to drive industrial and commercial processes in the direction of low emissions or less carbon-intensive approaches than those used when there is no cost to emitting carbon dioxide and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Since GHG mitigation projects generate credits, this approach can be used to finance carbon reduction schemes between trading partners and around the world, goes the Protocol.\u000a\u000aThe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Protocol allows tradable credits to that set up environmentally friendlier projects. A consultant or a trader usually helps the manufacturer to sell the credits and in the process gets a share.\u000a\u000aAccording to industry insiders, such as Noble, First Climate and Gensol Consultants have already reduced activity related to the carbon credit market. While Noble India and Gensol could not be spoken to, despite repeated attempts, First Climate confirmed all was not well in the Indian carbon trading market. Its associate director, Saurabh Jain, said: \u201cWe are not closing our carbon trading desk but it is true that we are not seeing any growth in the trading business. We are reducing our focus on the pure carbon credit trading business and will put more emphasis on renewals and climate change projects.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter the climate change conference talks at Durban last December, Indian industry hopes it would gain from an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, otherwise scheduled to ned in 2012. But, prices of carbon credits, once at 17, started a downward slide from last year and settled at 5.08 in April 2012. Major public sector units such as SAIL, ONGC and even Delhi Metro own CERs. In the private sector, Reliance Industries and ITC are among those holding CERs.\u000a\u000aThe global carbon market grew exponentially from $11 billion in 2005 to $144 bn in 2009. In 2010, the market started a downward spiral, when the total value fell to $142 bn.\u000a\u000aAs of November 2011, India had 2,123 approved CDM projects. Of these, 738 were registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, according to data by Ficci, the business chamber.\u000a\u000aAccording to Seema Arora, executive director, CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainability Development: \u201cMany Indian companies had sold their carbon credits before the Durban talks. However, post Durban, European buyers are not honouring their commitments, citing recession and financial crisis.\u201d\u000a\u000aCompanies such as KPMG, which offer advisory and consultancy services to companies on their climate change and sustainability initiatives, saw their \u2018success fee\u2019 (or the advisory charges paid on the success of CER trading) come down.\u000a\u000a"The CDM market is not looking promising right now. There is a mismatch in the demand and supply. The demand for CERs has come down for a variety of reasons, including recession in Europe (which was a major buyer of the credits). There was an initial rush for registering projects under the CDM executive board to get carbon credits. But from 2010, the number of projects have come down by 75 per cent," said Arvind Sharma, head (climate change and sustainability services practice), KPMG India.

VIndia's efforts to develop a road map for growth that is low-carbon-based and inclusive are much-delayed. The expert panel constituted by the Government of India to develop low carbon strategies for inclusive growth in January 2010 was supposed to submit its interim and final report in April and September of the same year.\u000a\u000aIt was only in May 2011 that the panel, headed by economist Kirit Parikh, submitted its interim report. The final report is still awaited.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, India has been self-conscious of its emerging-economy status in international discussions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In June 2007, the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, committed at the G8 meeting in Germany that India's per capita emissions will not be allowed to exceed the average per capita emission levels of developed countries.\u000a\u000aIn December 2009, the Government announced that it would aim to reduce the emission intensity (amount of GHG emitted per rupee of the GDP) of the economy by 20-25 per cent of the 2005 level by 2020.\u000a\u000aEmission intensity is a tricky indicator. It can mark a reduction even when both the economy and absolute emissions record growth. The more realistic quantifiers are per capita GHG emissions and gross emissions of the country.\u000a\u000aCurrently, India's per capita emissions are very low compared with the other emerging and developed economies. At 1.18 tonnes per capita per year (2008 figure), it is many times lower than that of the US (19.10), Russia (11.24), the UK (8.60), South Africa (7.27), China (4.58) and even the world average of 4.38 tonnes per capita per year.\u000a\u000aTwo scenarios\u000a\u000aThe interim report of the Kirit Parikh panel projects two scenarios. The first one requires a \u2018determined effort' to reduce emission intensity by 23-25 per cent of the 2005 level by 2020 and the second one requires an \u2018aggressive effort' to reduce emission intensity by 33-35 per cent.\u000a\u000aWhile keeping the twin targets of reducing the emission intensity and supporting a 9 per cent growth for the GDP, the panel estimates an emission of 3.03 tonnes per capita of carbon dioxide by the year 2020 with the former and 2.66 tonnes with the latter.\u000a\u000aWhat the expert panel avoids talking about is the gross emissions from the country. Even low per capita emissions multiplied 1.2 billion times lead to a sizable total. In 2008, India had a total emission of 1.74 billion tonnes. Only China (7.03 Bt), US (5.46 Bt) and the European Union as a bloc (4.17 Bt) had higher figures.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to adopt an ostrich-in-the-sand approach and avoid discussing gross emissions. In a warming world, there cannot be an \u201cacceptable emission level.\u201d However, a fair amount of energy is required per person in every part of the country for inclusive growth.\u000a\u000aProjecting a population of 1.3 billion by 2020, India's gross emissions can go to 3.94 Bt, assuming that the \u2018determined effort' at 9 per cent growth is put in place and through it the per capita emissions are limited at 3.03 tonnes. This is still lower than the 1998 gross emissions figure for the top three.\u000a\u000aThe two variables in this extrapolation are population and per capita GHG emissions in the year 2020. The population graph in India has stabilised over the years and the expected population over the mid-term future can be reliably projected. The per capita emission is more difficult to project. The panel of experts led by Kirit Parikh has done part of the work by projecting that a certain figure is achievable.\u000a\u000aPyramid sans foundation\u000a\u000aWhat the panel has not yet said \u2014 how this can be achieved \u2014 is more critical than what they have said. The interim report of the expert panel does list a menu of options for low-carbon inclusive growth. A more detailed assessment of the costs and the institutional measure required are promised in the final report.\u000a\u000aSince the expert panel was constituted by the Planning Commission, and since its deliberations were running parallel to the process of developing the Twelfth Plan, it can be hoped that some of the processes recommended by the panel are incorporated into the Plan.\u000a\u000aThough the Plan Document itself is not yet public, the approach paper for the Plan, released in October 2011, does incorporate the main thinking from the panel's interim report.\u000a\u000aIndia should have undertaken the process of developing a road map for low carbon and inclusive growth long ago. During many Conferences of Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Indian negotiators have taken a position against accepting binding emission reduction targets.\u000a\u000aOver the years, India has pushed itself into a leadership position both for developing countries and also the emerging BRICS economies.\u000a\u000aThis is fair enough, since it is necessary to take positions in international negotiations, or else face the prospect of being bulldozed by the powerful lobbies. However, taking positions externally without having a road map in place internally is like building a pyramid without a foundation.\u000a\u000aQuite apart from whatever position Indian representatives continue to take in international negotiations, low-carbon-based growth will help the country reduce its wastage of resources and help industry become more competitive. The road map is the primary requirement, which has to be supported with an institutional mechanism to build and strengthen a green economy.\u000a\u000aHurry up with the final report!\u000a\u000a(The author is the regional environment manager with Panos South Asia.

VPowering the iPad with solar energy in sun-starved Antarctica is a breeze. But as Paras Loomba \u2013 a 26-year-old engineer from Ferozepur who was the 'Mr Fix It' in this year's 70-member International Antarctic Expedition \u2013 would tell you, using numb fingers to maneuver the screen at sub-zero temperatures is a different ball game altogether.Working in minus 3 degrees Celsius with penguins and humpback whales for company, Loomba lit up the entire base in Antarctica solely with renewable energy. Chosen among hundreds all over the world, Loomba was one of just four Indians among the team headed to the earth's coldest, windiest, driest and remotest continent.As the only hands-on engineer and the only techie in the team, it was up to him to lug all the equipment \u2013 wires, panels and transistors. These he would use to harness renewable energy to run almost everything, from lanterns to mikes to the latest drool-worthy gadget."If I can play Angry Birds in Antarctica using only solar power , there is no reason why Siachen can't work on clean tech," Loomba says. Of course, it meant sacrificing thermal gear for equipment that took up more than half of his permitted 29 kg luggage."The best part was that all these global leaders (on the expedition) were witnessing Indian technology lighting up the Antarctic. Imagine what wonders this can do for our forces," adds Loomba. The annual expedition was led by Sir Robert Swan, the only polar explorer to have trekked North and South Poles, and comprised environmentalists, motivational speakers and corporate executives including three from India.The annual expedition aims to show a cross section of society the effects of climate change first hand, so that they could be inspired to take small committed steps in their personal life to help lower global carbon footprint. Unique to this year's expedition was the use of Indian-made solar lanterns at the campsites. "My mom used one of the lamps, recharged in Antarctica, for a whole month at home," Loomba says. In fact, Swan's base camp is the only renewable energypowered camp in the world.The group also recorded alarming changes in temperatures in this ecosensitive region, blamed on climate change. For instance, whereas the team expected near-nil humidity, their instruments recorded a staggering 5%. Loomba says acute effects of climate change are seen clearly at the Poles."The ice cover in the Arctic region is actually increasing whereas in Antarctica we saw a huge 200 metre ice shelf \u2013 that is twice the length of a football stadium \u2013 break into the water, all because of rising global temperatures," he says.Though every team member was aware of the effects of global climate change, the truth hit them hard when they witnessed the drastic effects themselves. "Getting pictures clicked with hump-backed whales was our moment of reckoning. It hit us hard." These large, warm-blooded mammals traditionally stayed away from the ice-cold waters of the southern ocean. But rising temperatures and melting icebergs now make the waters navigable to these whales.Loomba believes that Antarctica is a must visit for every person once in their lifetime for a lesson in humility as nature's grandeur takes over. "But at this pace of change, the place will be lost before people can truly experience its magnificence," he says.

Vis termed as a booming space in India and is expected to witness more private funding, especially private equity funding in future. According to recent report by Grant Thornton, global cleantech sector is forecast to double in size from $188 billion in 2012 to $349 billion in 2020. The International Corporation (IFC), the arm of World Bank, is the largest private investor in Indian sector and had invested close to $1 billion so far in the space. Soumya Banerjee, Senior Investment Officer, Infrastructure and Natural Resources, IFC, speaks to Reghu Balakrishnan, about IFC\u2019s investment plans in India.\u000a\u000aWhat are IFC\u2019s interests in the space in India?\u000a\u000ais increasingly supporting private sector to move to a lower-carbon growth path\u2014through investments and advisory support in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and resource efficiency, together defined as climate-friendly investments. There has been a ramp up in terms of climate friendly investments in our South Asia portfolio since 2008. In 2008, we invested $58 million in 4 projects and 15 projects for $152 million in 2009. In 2010, we increased the number and size to 20 projects for $380 million and invested $165 million in 2011 in 13 projects. In FY12, till now, has made 12 investments with climate change impact totaling approximately $160 million. At the global level, plans to grow its commitment in climate friendly investments from about $1 billion a year in FY10 to $3 billion a year by FY15.\u000a\u000aWhat are your other activities in India?\u000a\u000aIFC supports solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, and off-grid generation in India. We have partnered with several financial institutions like Axis Bank, PTC India Financial Services, Tata Cleantech Capital and IDFC to expand the availability of long term credit lines for renewable energy financing and the capability to evaluate climate-friendly projects through advisory support. We are working on a public-private partnership deal with the state of Gujarat, to design and structure a distributed rooftop solar power project in the state capital of Gandhinagar. The project includes the installation of rooftop solar panels that will generate 5 megawatts of power for over 12,000 households in the city.\u000a\u000aWhich areas of clean energy will have a great potential in future? Why?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExcluding large hydro, renewable currently account for only a modest 24.5 gigawatts or 12% of total installed capacity. Two thirds of this renewable capacity is still dominated by wind power, but the Government of India\u2019s recent laudable promotion efforts through the solar initiative, the guidelines for biomass projects and the national biofuels blending policy will likely result in a significant increase of solar and biomass projects from present levels in the coming years. That\u2019s where IFC sees an important role for itself in terms of incentivising investors to scale up and replicate these investments.\u000a\u000aWhat are the opportunities in various clean energy models in India?\u000a\u000aThe strong policy initiatives by the government and strong investor interest in solar power, there appears to be a good possibility of solar power emerging as the next big growth area in years to come, especially in India which has a good solar resource. The growth of solar technologies would depend to a large extent on the rate of decrease in technology costs. Through the current policy initiatives if technology costs can be brought down to a level where solar power comes to parity with other sources of commercial power, it can lead to a rapid growth in this sector.\u000a\u000aOne of the great benefits of both wind power and solar power (especially solar photovoltaic) is the modular nature of the generating units and the relatively quick installation time and operationally it is quite simple. These factors support rapid growth of this sector. Projects in hydro power are usually complex projects which require careful analysis and a fairly long lead time to develop. Opportunities in this sector are expected to continue at a modest pace.\u000a\u000aWhich are your funds for clean energy initiatives and allocation for India?\u000a\u000aIFC manages a Global Environment Facility funded programme called the Earth Fund that aims to support private sector initiatives to test, develop, and scale up new technologies and business models in climate change and biodiversity through concessional and technical assistance. The Earth Fund is a global fund with a total allocation of $40 million, of which $25 million has been committed to date in eight projects around the world.\u000a\u000aIFC's Clean Technology Innovation Fund, a $60 million facility, will allow IFC to invest in early stage cleantech companies, including seed investments in higher risk sectors and geographies. IFC will also invest up to $75 million in the $250-million Global Climate Partnership Facility along with KfW, with the focus to make investments in emerging markets including India that will reduce greenhouse gas.

VNEW DELHI: On the second day of the Bonn climate change negotiations, the US, the EU and other developed countries tried to stall discussions on whether the rich countries had met their obligations on reducing emissions and financing the poor countries. Many developed countries pushed for talks to take place only on a new single legal treaty that would wipe out all past and existing obligations.The talks got stalled with developed countries opposing adoption of the agenda, which requires pending issues from the Bali Action Plan of 2009 to be addressed before negotiations on this parallel channel come to end this year. Under the Bali Action Plan, the developed countries, including the US, are required to increase their ambition levels to cut emissions.India intervened to say that it was important to address the \u201cunresolved issues\u201d and these should not be allowed to fall off the table.India was also in the lead in making a joint statement on behalf of the BASIC countries which includes Brazil, China and South Africa. In a not so veiled threat, the four countries said the negotiations would falter unless the developed countries operationalized their targets to reduce emissions under Kyoto Protocol Phase II by the end of the year.\u201cThe failure in reaching a satisfactory resolution and completion of work of AWG-KP (a channel where rich countries give their targets) at COP 18 (to be held in November 2012 in Doha) without any further conditions would gravely affect the full scope of negotiations and implementation under the climate change regime,\u201d they said.After EU, along with least developed countries and small island states, pushed for starting talks on a single new treaty in 2012 itself, the major developing countries fear that Kyoto Protocol II would be made redundant before it takes off in 2013 and the firewall between rich and poor countries\u2019 responsibilities breached unless principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are first addressed.At the Bonn talks which are scheduled to run for two weeks, the BASIC countries in a joint statement expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about \u201cship-jumping\u201d by developed countries like Canada and Japan renouncing their commitments under Kyoto Protocol.

VPUNE: Weather scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology are studying high resolution climate projections over South Asian Monsoon region which is expected to contribute to future crop and water management and planning in India.The study undertaken is part of the World Meteorological Organization WMO ) Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment ( CORDEX ) for which Centre for Climate Change Research ( CCCR ) of IITM is acting as a nodal agency for South Asia."The futuristic dimension of this project spanning next 20-25 years will help the country in better planning of crop and water resources and also aid more accurate monsoon predictions, resulting from the use of high resolution models," R Krishnan, executive director CCCR said.Aided by Union ministry of Earth Sciences which funds IITM, the study, launched in February, will facilitate generation of high resolution regional climate projections with involvement of various cliamte modelling and impact assessment groups from India and other countries including Norway, Australia, Japan and Germany."Running global climate model is an expensive proposition. This CORDEX project holds importance for us because South Asian countries need more monsoon information on regional scale for their agricultural planning," noted Krishnan, adding the time frame of the study is tentatively worked out at five years.The CORDEX study will involve use of high resolution (with every grid area of 30-35 km) aiming accuracy and precision in the Asian monsoon projections.Since rainfall projections over smaller areas is a complex task, multiple high resolution models to study atmosphere , wind and humidity in the CORDEX experiment assumes importance as they provide greater reliability in respect of regional climate changes, Krishnan observed.The inputs gathered from high resolution models will also include information about climate extremes such as heat waves, drought, floods and storms that could impact the country's economy.Apart from providing a more reliable data on regional climate change, the CORDEX project will also help in quantifying uncertainties in the model projections, thus further aiding the impact assessment studies focusing on agricultural sector and water resource management as the inputs will be fed to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes ( IPCC ).

VCalling on students and researchers alike to think about the future, JSS Centre for Management Studies (JSS CMS) director V Prakash said it was important to have a \u2018Mysore Declaration\u2019, which would highlight effects on food patterns due to global climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPrakash, who was also director of Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), was speaking at a national seminar on \u2018Geospatial and Ecological Mapping of Biodiversity \u2014 Tools and Techniques\u2019 organised by the department of studies in earth science, University of Mysore, here on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aObserving that a change of one degree Celsius would result in 10 per cent in food production, Prakash said researchers have to plan for 50 years instead of five or 10 years. Expressing his concern at research taking a narrow view of relevant issues, Prakash said, the university should promote projects to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore involving more than 25,000 researchers in order to understand changes in biodiversity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aResearchers should interact, internet and network for a project to be successful. He also told them to involve tribals in any research. Unless information and practises are taken from tribals, data would be incomplete. Relying only on satellite technology would result in losing out several centuries of knowledge, he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNoting that there was seven per cent increase in admissions to hospitals for every one degree Celsius change in temperature, Prakash said it is essential to have a \u2018low food print diet\u2019 and more exercise, which would cause less cancer, obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe said instead of \u2018corporate social responsibility (CSR)\u2019, each individual should focus on \u2018Concerned Social Responsibility.\u2019Earlier, Gandhigram Rural University, Dindigul, vice-chancellor S M Ramasamy said it was essential to understand the link between geodiversity and biodiversity. He urged the UoM to create a database on factors relating to biodiversity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUniversity of Mysore V-C V G Talawar, earth science department chairman B Basavalingu, seminar coordinator P Madesh and L Mahesh Bilwa were present.

VMANALI: The debate may be continuing about global warming, but the ground reality here is that dozens of streams and brooks of Kullu district have dried up completely, while many others are about to disappear. Climate change has left dozens of gharats (water mills) useless here in the absence of water.\u000a\u000aResidents are witnessing that water levels of the streams are gradually going down and eventually the streams disappear. Water levels in all tributaries of Parbati and Beas rivers have decreased. Natural drinking water springs are also thinning out rapidly, they said. Jwani, Rampur, Bari, Kharu, Bainala, Ladinala, Bagarnala, Nagabai, Saininala and dozens of other water streams in Manikaran, Kharahal, Banjar, Aani, Manali and Lag valleys of Kullu have gone extinct in the last three decades. Residents said that insufficient and declining level of snowfall is the main reason behind drying up of water sources.\u000a\u000a"Our valley had two gharats -- one at Mahish and another in Tharku village and over 40 villages were dependent on them for getting their grain grinded," an elderly from Chansari village, Shiv Ram Sharma, remembers the earlier days. "Our entire valley now has no water stream to run one gharat. It seems, our new generation would not be lucky enough to see the beautiful Beas river in future and there would be no need to build a bridge on it for safe passage of people."\u000a\u000aOver 25 gharats on Bran nullah, Rampur nullah, Kais streams and Balsari nullah have gone non-operational as water levels were not sufficient enough to rotate the mechanical grinders. Tej Ram Thakur, owner of a gharath, said his 16 year-old grandson could never see their gharat grinding the grain. "Snow is the source to generate water streams which is disappearing fast. Our village used to get burried under 5 feet of snow 25 years ago, but now we are longing for only one foot. Temperature is increasing and drying up of streams is obvious," he said.\u000a\u000aThe area under cultivation is regularly increasing in Kullu and small streams are apparently unable to fulfill the large demand for irrigation water. A web of paved canals has been built in the district but there is not enough water in the streams to feed them and meet the demands of farmers.\u000a\u000aScientists say that depleting water sources are the reason for climate change and irregularity in snowfall. "Some parts are witnessing heavy snowfall while others are recording sharp fall. The overall temperature has recorded a slight rise and the peaks, which used to remain covered with snow all through the year, have no snow owing to human interference. The aerosol particles are playing their role in global warming," warned scientist with Kullu-based Govind Ballabh Pant institute of Himalayan Environment and Development, Dr J C Kuniyal.

VWASHINGTON: Climate change may be the main culprit behind the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization around 4,000 years ago, says a new study, which also claims to have resolved the long-standing debate over the source and fate of the Saraswati, a sacred river in Hindu mythology.The study, combining the latest archaeological data along with state-of-the-art geoscience technologies , suggested that decline in monsoon rains led to weakened river dynamics, and played a critical role both in the development and the fall of the Harappan culture , which relied on river floods to fuel their agricultural surpluses.The international team, which published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used satellite photos and topographic data to make and analyse digital maps of landforms constructed by the Indus and other neighbouring rivers, which were then probed in the field by drilling, coring, and even manuallydug trenches. Collected samples were used to determine the sediments\u2019 origins, whether brought in by rivers or wind, and their age, in order to develop a chronology of landscape changes.\u201cWe reconstructed the dynamic landscape of the plain where the Indus civilization developed 5,200 years ago, built its cities, and disintegrated between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago,\u201d said lead researcher Liviu Giosan, a geologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US. \u201cOur study suggests that the decline in monsoon rains led to weakened river dynamics , and played a key role both in development and the fall of Harappan culture,\u201d he said.The research, which was conducted between 2003 and 2008, also claimed that the mythical Saraswati river was actually not fed by glaciers in the Himalayas as believed. Rather, it was a perennial monsoon-supported watercourse and aridification reduced it to short seasonal flows, the researchers said.

VThe Centre for Science and Environment recently released the findings of a study it had undertaken to examine the impact of climate change on development in the Sundarbans. The following facts have since become a part of the public domain: I. The sea surface temperature (SST) in these islands has been increasing at 0.5 degree centigrade per decade. II. In the last 25 years, the sea level has risen at a rate of 8 mm per year. This is more than double the global average. III. The monsoon has become erratic but intense, and incidents of severe cyclones have risen by 26 per cent over the Bay of Bengal. IV. Between the years 2000 and 2008, the Sundarbans witnessed a net soil loss of 44.042 sq km annually. V. Soil salinity in the northern Sundarbans stands at up to 8 parts per thousand. In the south, it ranges between 8-20 PPT (the safety limit being 4-6 PPT). Now consider some of the other findings that can help to map the contours of the challenge of development in the Sundarbans: I. Nearly 44 per cent of the Sundarbans population lives below the poverty line, and 65 per cent of the total working population is dependent on agriculture. II. Approximately 87 per cent of the population suffers from food scarcity, while the average holding of cultivable land per agricultural labourer is less than 0.5 hectares. III. Healthcare facilities are primitive. There is just one technical college in an area as large as 250 sq km. The disaster management system is equally archaic. A scrutiny of these facts establishes the link between deteriorating ecological conditions and the concomitant slide in the development graph of the Sundarbans. The CSE report indicates that the rise in SST has had a negative impact on rainfall, which, in turn, has adversely affected agriculture. Changing sea temperatures have also led to the dwindling of some fish species, the Indian mackerel for example, and made fishing less profitable. Rising sea levels have aggravated soil erosion, inundation and, consequently, salinity, affecting paddy production. (The yield of paddy in the Sundarbans is 1.5-2 tonnes per hectare, as against the national average of 3.28 tonnes.) The fall in agricultural productivity, combined with the lack of alternative livelihoods and the depletion of non-timber forest products, has led to a sharp rise in migration. A survey by the Jayaprakash Institute of Social Change, conducted between September 2010 and January 2011, cited by the CSE report, showed that 75 per cent of the respondents families had witnessed out-migration. (The picture on top is of a boat abandoned by a migrant family.) But the Bengal governments inability to understand such evident links has resulted in ecology and climate change being perceived as unconnected to development at the policy level. Significantly, a holistic view of the ecological crisis is seldom represented  the full-page advertisements listing the achievements of the current government, brought out on its completion of one year in office, referred only to water conservation. Moreover, the complexity of the Sundarbans ecology and the need to forge adaptation tools at the local level remain unacknowledged. For instance, during her visit to Gosaba in January, the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, requested the locals to give up their land for the construction of stronger embankments. One wonders whether the chief minister is aware that embankments, while partially resisting erosion, have increased the deposit of sediments on the river bed, raising the water level and, ironically, the possibility of flooding. My third visit to the Sundarbans  this time I went as far as Emilybari  was not undertaken to contest the CSEs findings. Many of the symptoms of the unfolding ecological crisis have remained the same since my first visit after Aila. The saline top soil remains yellow on vast stretches of paddy fields in Rangabelia and Satjelia (bottom centre). On the kheyaghat at Jatirampur, I was shown some green coconuts that had developed brown gashes because of water contamination (bottom left). On my way to Emilybari, I discovered that the leaves of the Kalo Bain (Avicennia marina)  a mangrove species  had turned crimson on account of the waters high acidic content (bottom right). I wanted to find out, on this visit, whether the people of the Sundarbans had in their mind a template that could force the government to co-opt ecology, though belatedly, into the debate on development. So imagine my surprise when I heard the panchayat pradhan of Emilybari elaborate, not on the ecological challenges, but on the beautification drive being undertaken in the village. The serpentine and unmetalled road that led to the river would be lit with solar lamps (there is no electricity in Emilybari); trees like Shonajhuri and Eucalyptus  not the threatened but immensely useful Hargaj (Acanthus ilicifolius) or Kalo Bain  would be planted. Pressed further, he conceded that the plan to introduce solar lamps was an exercise in populism. He added that the forest department, in its afforestation drive, had dismissed his plea for including mangrove species that resist soil erosion and act as a buffer during cyclones. The pradhans helpless attempts at sensitizing the local administration to these ecological needs are indicative of three crucial things. First, as argued by the CSE report, climate change and the consequent ecological degradation in the Sundarbans remain unrepresented at local policy and institutional levels. Second, the adaptation techniques that are being devised are flawed and ineffective because of a rudimentary understanding of the ecological transformations. The inhabitants of Emilybari confessed to the administrations tacit support to migration as a tool to contend with the crisis. Finally, these grim realities underscore the urgent need to decentralize grassroots institutions like panchayats and gram sabhas. However, decentralization is unlikely within the existing political framework on account of two reasons. Political parties are willing to view panchayats only as conduits to securing power. The autonomy of panchayats has also been severely compromised by the entrenched elitism in the bureaucracy. (A forest department official, even though an outsider, has the temerity to instruct the pradhan, a man with a far better understanding of the areas fragile ecology, on what saplings should be planted in Emilybari.) What must be explored is the possibility of amending the laws to facilitate the creation of an apolitical, but constitutional, apparatus that can act as an agency in tandem with the panchayats to exert pressure on the State to combine ecological and developmental concerns. The people I talked to in Emilybari seemed to be amenable to the creation of advisory committees within the local governance model. Unlike the panchayats, the advisory bodies made up of independent experts would not be saddled with political responsibilities. This would give them the leverage necessary to engage with the insensitivities of the State without compromising the authority of the panchayats. But the inclusion of ecology in the framework of development would also require the immediate stakeholders  the people of the Sundarbans  to transform themselves into an effective pressure group. This is certainly a risky proposition in a country that has ceded the middle ground for dialogue between the State and dissidents. But one should examine the option of exploring policy initiatives such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act as a means of imposing an ecological agenda on elected representatives. The CSE report has legitimately expressed reservations about the MNREGA as an effective agency to raise awareness on ecology and development. This is because the MNREGA has been crippled by persistent deficiencies: discrimination on political lines in the distribution of job cards, the States inability to pay compensation on time, an embedded orthodoxy that has prevented planners from using the MNREGA to make community assets ecologically viable. While sharing the CSEs cynicism, I would like to argue that the MNREGA still remains the best bet for local communities to demand cogent, inclusive safeguards for the ecology that would also hasten development. This is not only because the MNREGA has a phenomenal reach (even remote corners of the country are aware of the 100-day work initiative), but also because, as a policy, it has occasionally shown glimpses of flexibility. This month, a notification by the ministry of rural development amended the MNREGAs schedules to include the creation of personal assets  building of poultry shelters or latrines  as eligible for payment. Similarly, in the Sundarbans, the scope of the enlisted tasks under this welfare programme can be widened to include the desilting of rivers and the cutting of channels in them to check erosion and afforestation. Local communities must also be allowed to contribute not only labour but also the fruit of their intricate knowledge of the Sundarbans ecology. The government must stop looking at the MNREGA only as a means of economic sustenance. The local community and its representatives, such as the panchayats, must also be taught to demand the incorporation of sound ecological practices within the ambit of this Central programme. I have often wondered why the definition of the stakeholders as victims of climate change in the Sundarbans excludes Calcuttans. The citys creaking infrastructure is being put under pressure by migrants, who provide cheap domestic labour. Perhaps it is time for Calcuttans to ponder whether they ought to make their own the battle against the ravages of nature in the Sundarbans. Admittedly, this can only be fostered by greater interaction between the city dwellers and the islanders. Tourists, who flock to these mesmerizing islands, could be the primary targets for raising levels of awareness. On an earlier visit, I remember a group of tourists listening attentively to the guide  a local who, after pointing to the dead trunk of a Sundari tree (Heritiera fomes) floating on the river, said that the islands derived their name from that species. He should have added that the Sundari is a rare sight today, even in the forests. The CSE report notes that the outbreak of agamora and the rise of salinity have depleted the Sundaris numbers. Tour operators should be requested  or even hired  by NGOs to lead tourists to not just the Sajnekhali watch-tower but also to the interiors of Gosaba, Bali, Satjelia, Rangabelia in order to gain direct knowledge of the looming ecological crisis. I would like to suggest that tourists should take the land route to observe how the predatory rivers are devouring the land, washing away feeble embankments, poisoning the fields, even as the foliage wilts, fruits wither and the conflict between humans and animals intensifies. Hopefully, after witnessing such disturbing scenes, Calcuttans, who remain largely indifferent to the plight of the islands and their people, would demand corrective action from the government more stridently. On this trip, while crossing the Bidya river, I witnessed a tourist taking pictures of the dusk falling. A young woman in her bridal wear sat with her husband near him. The skin on their arms, having been exposed to saline water, had developed white patches. But the camera, I noticed, remained focused on the darkening sky.

VBetween 3,900 and 3,000 years ago,the Indus Valley civilisationone of the worlds biggest civilisations,the size of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia put togethercame to an end. Until now,there were no clear answers,only hypotheses. Did invading foreigners destroy the civilisation? Probably there were massive earthquakes that destroyed cities along the Indus and its tributaries? Or maybe the rivers simply shifted course and left the cities on their banks to decay? Now there is compelling evidence to show that it was climate change that led to the collapse of the earliest civilisation India has seen.\u000a\u000aThe findings,part of a new study titled Fluvial landscapes of the Harappan civilisation,were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last week. The study was conducted between 2003 and 2008 by an international team of scientists from US,India,UK,Pakistan and Romania with specialties in geology,geomorphology,archaeology and mathematics.\u000a\u000aThe study concludes that the slow eastern shift of the monsoons is what initially supported the civilisation by encouraging agriculture,but as the monsoon shifted further east,it weakened rain-fed rivers that were the lifeline of the civilisation.\u000a\u000aThere have been numerous speculations until now about the links between this mysterious ancient culture and its life-giving rivers. We reconstructed the dynamic landscape of the plain where the Indus civilisation developed 5,200 years ago,built its cities,and slowly disintegrated between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago, says Liviu Giosan,a geologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the lead author of the study.\u000a\u000aProf Ronojoy Adhikari of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences,Chennai,who was part of the international team,says the work brings together several independent sources of data for the first timesediments,topography,fluvial patterns,and archaelogical recordsto provide compelling support for the climate change hypothesis.\u000a\u000aOur work shows that none of the earlier hypothesesforeign invasion,rivers shifting courseis likely to be true. Rather,it was the shifting of the monsoon,which receded towards the north and the east of the Indian continent,that led to a drying up of the land in which the Harappans had made their civilisation and subsequently its collapse. This is the main finding our work, he says.\u000a\u000aThe study also claims to resolve a long-standing debate over the source and fate of the mythical river,Sarasvati. Based on scriptural descriptions,it was believed that the Sarasvati was fed by glaciers in the Himalayas. Today,the Ghaggar,an intermittent river that flows only during strong monsoons and dissipates into the desert along the dried course of Hakra valley,is thought to best approximate the location of the mythic Sarasvati,but its Himalayan origin and whether it was active during Vedic times remain controversial. According to the team,the new geological evidence indicates that rivers were indeed sizable and highly active in this region,but most likely due to strong monsoons. The findings says that the Sarasvati (Ghaggar-Hakra) was not Himalayan-fed,but a perennial,monsoon-supported watercourse and aridification reduced it to short seasonal flows.\u000a\u000aThe paper says that like their contemporaries,the Harappans lived next to rivers,owing their livelihoods to the fertility of the annually watered lands. Urbanism flourished in the western region of the Indo-Gangetic plain for approximately 600 years,but since approximately 3,900 years ago,the total settled area and settlement sizes declined,many sites were abandoned,and a significant shift in site numbers and density towards the east is recorded\u2026The fluvial quiescence suggests a gradual decrease in flood intensity that probably stimulated intensive agriculture initially and encouraged urbanisation\u2026further decline in monsoon precipitation led to conditions adverse to both inundation and rain-based farming, concludes the study.\u000a\u000aOver five years,the team studied satellite photos and topographic data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission,prepared and analysed digital maps of landforms constructed by the Indus and neighbouring rivers and corroborated this on the field by drilling,coring,and digging trenches.\u000a\u000aThe samples collected showed that around 5,200 years ago,settlements came up along the Indus as weakened monsoons and reduced run-off from the mountains tamed the wild Indus and its Himalayan tributaries enough to enable agriculture along their banks.\u000a\u000aThe Harappans were enterprising people. The rivers were wild before the Indus civilisation started to appear. But as the monsoons and river floods started decreasing in intensity,agriculture started and gradually,the Indus became habitable and developed big cities, says Giosan.\u000a\u000aWhen researchers stumbled on this civilisation in the 1920s,they found evidence of sea links with Mesopotamia,arts and crafts and a still-to-be deciphered writing. The cities here,with Harappa being the largest of them,lasted for almost 2,000 years,but as the rains weakened,the monsoon-based rivers dried,leading to migration.\u000a\u000aGiosan says the Harappans had an escape route to the east,towards the Ganges basin,where monsoon rains were more reliable. There is a huge amount of archaeological work but it has never been linked properly to the evolution of the fluvial landscape. We now see landscape dynamics as the crucial link between climate change and people, he says.\u000a\u000aThe team considers the findings a lesson from the past. Today the Indus system feeds the largest irrigation scheme in the world. But if the monsoon were to increase in a warming world,as predicted by some,catastrophic floods such as the floods in Pakistan of 2010,would turn the current irrigation system,designed for a tamer river,obsolete. says Giosan.\u000a\u000aAdhikari says,We need to step back and think much more seriously about how we must take care of our environment,or,we might face the same situation that our ancestors did in the Indus plains 4,000 years ago.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

VEnvironment and climate change will now be a part of the basic training of India\u2019s top administrators.\u000a\u000aThe government has decided to set up a specialised centre on climate change at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) at Mussoorie in the northern state of Uttarakhand.\u000a\u000aThe academy provides training to newly recruited Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and offers specialised in-job courses for IAS officers at different levels. Several new courses on emerging areas in India have also been initiated in the academy in the last few years.\u000a\u000aLatest feather in the cap is the specialised centre to attune IAS officers to the danger of climate change for India and how administrators can help in fighting the challenge which is expected to impact every region in the country.\u000a\u000aA recent environment ministry study has indicated that the threat of climate change in India is real and adapting to the fast-changing weather will be key to fighting global warming. For that, administrators at the ground level need to know about its threats and ways it can be dealt with in a cost-effective manner.\u000a\u000aTo ensure that, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and LBSNAA have tied up to put in place an academic learning centre on climate change and environment issues.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be a comprehensive knowledge base with implementable tools for administrators,\u201d said Caitlin Wiesen, Country Director of UNDP India at a recent function.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the academy said the centre is still at a \u201cnascent\u201d stage and will take some time before it comes up. The centre will help the academy in widening the scope of its existing courses and start some new courses.\u000a\u000aThe climate change centre is a specialised unit coming up at the academy. The IAS officers will be receiving specialised training on rural strategy, urban management, gender equality and disaster management through these centres.\u000a\u000aEven before the climate change comes up, the academy has tried to be a model office for future administrators. It has turned into a complete paper-less office with electronic file movement system, where even the key decisions are taken on electronic files.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe also have all our educational resources on digital format to reduce the use of paper,\u201d an academy official said.

VIndia is going to the Rio+Earth Summit determined to ensure the conference does not result in restrictive trade practices in the name of the green economy.\u000a\u000aIn a hurriedly convened media briefing on the eve of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s departure to Mexico and the Earth Summit, India\u2019s chief negotiator at Rio, environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan pointed out that the G 77 nations and China, along with India, are expected to negotiate together to ensure that sustainable development goals (SDGs) remain voluntary and not binding as is being insisted upon by the industrialised countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do not want trade restrictive measures or protectionism in the name of green growth,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aElaborating on this, she said that India was of the view that green economy as a concept will succeed only if it enhances the ability of developing nation\u2019s to address poverty eradication, provide adequate policy space for national priorities and also ensure that structural changes do not result in green protectionism by the developed world.\u000a\u000aDescribing the run up to the summit, the minister emphasised that a Zero Draft Text was being negotiated for some time though she failed to elaborate on just how both the contentious this draft had become.\u000a\u000aThe minister reiterated that CBDR remained one of the goal posts for the Rio meet. Though she did concede that though G 77 nation and China \u201cwere not in agreement on all issues, we nevertheless have a shared vision of development\u201d. India was already committed to a low carbon growth but the industrialised nations would have to provide financial and technological support to assist developing nations make a transition to the green economy.\u000a\u000aThe Rio Summit, starting June 29, is being held 20 years after the first Earth Summit. A key meeting of world leaders, it is hoped it will help rally them into preparing a common environmental blueprint.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in India, private equity investors are lining up to invest `25,000-30,000 crores in green energy projects. The states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka are close to finalising norms to promote green energy ventures.

VNext week, world leaders gather for a momentous occasion \u2014 the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro. Will it be a success? In my opinion, yes. To be sure, the negotiations have been lengthy. Even now there is more disagreement than agreement on the details of the so-called \u201coutcome document\u201d that will emerge. Yet that will not be the defining measure. Far more important is what the Rio conference has already accomplished. And that is to build a global movement for change.\u000a\u000aGreen strategies in practice\u000a\u000aRio+20 is a milestone on a long road. The famous 1992 Earth Summit put sustainable development on the global agenda. Today, we have come to a broader and more nuanced understanding of this age-old imperative: how to better balance the development needs of a growing world population \u2014 so that all may enjoy the fruits of prosperity and robust economic growth \u2014 with the necessity of conserving our planet's most precious resources: land, air and water. At Rio, more than 100 heads of state and government will join an estimated 25,000 participants to map our way ahead. For too long we have sought to burn and consume our way to prosperity. That model is dead. At Rio, we must begin to create a new one \u2014 a model for a 21st century economy that rejects the myth that there must be a zero-sum trade-off between growth and the environment. Increasingly, we understand that, with smart public policies, governments can grow their economies, alleviate poverty, create decent jobs and accelerate social progress in a way that respects the earth's finite natural resources.\u000a\u000aIn this larger sense, I believe that momentum for change is already irreversible. The evidence is all around, hiding in plain sight in countries large and small, rich and poor. Barbados, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and South Africa, among many others, are already adopting \u201cgreen growth\u201d strategies that use limited natural resources more efficiently, create jobs and promote low-carbon development. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Kenya, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Senegal and Ukraine are applying new green-growth technologies in a variety of industries, from agriculture to tourism. China has committed itself to supplying 16 per cent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 and plans to invest more than $450 billion in waste recycling and clean technologies under its current five-year plan.\u000a\u000aIn Brazil, waste management and recycling employs more than 500,000 people, most of whom live on society's margins. Under its new National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, India has begun paying people to better manage natural resources, such as forests and fresh water.\u000a\u000aWherever you look, national and local authorities are adopting principles and practices that, taken together, could help move us from a prospect of environmental ruin and growing social inequality towards a new era of inclusive and balanced sustainable growth.\u000a\u000aCorporate initiatives\u000a\u000aGovernments and nation-states are not alone in driving this transformation. At Rio, more than 1,000 corporate leaders from all continents will deliver a common message: business as usual no longer works. Many are members of the United Nations Global Compact \u2014 volunteers in a growing private-sector movement that understands that 21st-century corporate responsibility means corporate sustainability. Thus Nike (a champion of so-called \u201cclosed loop\u201d manufacturing that minimises industrial pollution) has initiated a new programme called Mata no Peito \u2014 a Portuguese colloquialism for \u201ctaking on a challenge\u201d by helping protect Brazilian forest ecosystems. Unilever has pledged to source all its raw materials from sustainable sources by 2020. Kenya's Safaricom has integrated gender equality into its internal policies to create a mother-friendly environment.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Microsoft has announced it will soon go carbon-neutral. China's Broad Group produces non-electric air conditioning units that are 200 per cent more energy efficient; it is now diversifying into other energy-saving products and sustainable buildings. ToughStuff from Mauritius seeks to bring affordable and reliable solar energy to 33 million people in Africa by 2016, and the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company is working to provide rural electrification in Afghanistan and the South Pacific island nation of Tonga.\u000a\u000aFocus on energy\u000a\u000aEnergy will be a major focus at Rio. I call it the \u201cgolden thread\u201d that connects the dots to a sustainable future \u2014 the key driver for development, social inclusion and environmental protection, including climate change. That is why, in 2011, I established a new initiative called Sustainable Energy for All. Our aim: to ensure universal access to modern energy services for the one in five people worldwide who lack them; to reduce energy waste by doubling energy efficiency; and to double the share of renewables in the global energy mix. In Rio, leaders from government, business and civil society will announce a galaxy of actions to advance these goals, from promoting cleaner, more efficient cook-stoves to helping governments scale up their geothermal and other renewable energy potential.\u000a\u000aSustainable Energy for All is the partnership model of the future. The principle is simple but powerful: the United Nations uses its unrivalled convening power to bring all relevant actors to the table so they can work in common cause for the common good.\u000a\u000aAt bottom, this is what Rio+20 is all about. Yes, the negotiations themselves are very important. Agreements that can be committed to paper today will shape the debates of tomorrow. But Rio+20 goes beyond that. It is the expression of a dynamic global movement for change \u2014 and a big step forward toward the future we want.\u000a\u000a(Courtesy: U.N. Information Centre for India and Bhutan.

VA devastating cyclone will strike the state in April 2050, inundating coastal regions of East Midnapore and the Sunderbans. This will trigger flash migration to urban centres and send Kolkata reeling. Parks will turn into slums and every inch of free space will be occupied.\u000a\u000aIn the cruel summer that will follow, the mercury will breach the 42 degree celcius mark. Radiation from sun rays reflecting off the steel and glass buildings and exhaust from AC cars and homes will push the temperature higher by another 2 degree. With lakhs of people exposed to the heat, thousands will fall ill and hundreds will drop dead due to heat stroke. Egg production will also nosedive due to heat stress on livestock.\u000a\u000aThe situation will get worse as water scarcity will hit large pockets. With aquifers running low and arsenic spreading into ground water in north and central Kolkata, rationing of water will become a way of life. Statewide, demand for water for agriculture, industry, domestic use, forest/ecology and energy will skyrocket from 106.18 to 452.82 billion billion cubic metre.\u000a\u000aIn June, cloud bursts will inundate large sections of the city. In the following weeks, incidents of cholera, diarrhoea and enteric fever will spiral. Malaria cases will shoot up not just in Kolkata but in upper reaches of Darjeeling as well. Large quantities of vegetables will perish as cloudbursts will leave farms in North and South 24-Parganas waterlogged. The lack of tolerance in hybrid seeds will make matter worse... Flooding has been affecting Aman production over the past several years and delivers a crippling blow in the crisis year.\u000a\u000aIn Kolkata, water refuses to recede. Largescale concretization and encroachment of wetlands over past several decades has left hardly any soak pit in and around the city.\u000a\u000aThese predictions of Kolkata in Circa 2050 may be dismissed by a section of scientists, but they are outnumbered by a huge margin by those in the fraternity who believe in such an eventuality if remedial measures are not taken today.\u000a\u000a"It isn't just climate change that may trigger a series of events. Erosion of land along Bengal's coastline is a huge threat. Given the vast population pressure in the Sunderbans, which has led to people settling even in spillage areas beyond embankments, natural calamities will lead to large scale displacement and migration to urban centres. Kolkata, being the nearest city, will bear the brunt," said Jadavpur University School of Oceanographic Studies joint director Gautam Sen.\u000a\u000aJoyashree Roy, coordinator of Global Change Programme at JU and a member of the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, felt rise in migration will hurt Kolkata most if the city fails to prepare itself for the situation. "Denying effects of climate change will hurt the state and the city. Given the frequency of extreme events, Kolkata will have to deal with migration periodically. Planning and preparedness is needed for a metropolis that is already stressed," she pointed out.\u000a\u000aThe domino effect of migration will touch every sphere, overwhelming infrastructure, services and sensibilities. Even the last bastions of pedestrian-free space around Victoria Memorial Hall will be over-run by the human deluge.\u000a\u000a"The government needs to grab the situation by the collar and face it head on. A study of base and peak load population is essential to decide on how much to augment the infrastructure," Roy reasoned.\u000a\u000aThe other factor that has scientists worried is the erratic rainfall pattern. Kalyani University environment department head S C Santra feels that will pose the biggest challenge, reducing agriculture output and affecting crop security. Shortage of feed will also affect livestock. "Many crops cannot take high heat and water stress. With aman production getting hit due to waterlogging, there is more emphasis on boro crop that requires irrigation. To sustain it, we need to increase surface water storage, recharge ground water and rejuvenate rivers. If we fail to plan, food security will be compromised," said Santra.\u000a\u000aADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR WATER:\u000a\u000aIncrease water storage\u000a\u000aMake rooftop rainwater harvesting mandatory\u000a\u000aDesilt canals and drains\u000a\u000aRegulate ground water extraction\u000a\u000aImprove drainage system\u000a\u000aRecharge by afforestation in different sections of city\u000a\u000aExtend metering of water and charge water use\u000a\u000aADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR AGRICULTURE:\u000a\u000aPlan agro-climatic zone wise production of crops to maximize productivity\u000a\u000aPopularize indigenous rice variety and introduce cultivars of rice and maize that are heat resistant and can endure water stress\u000a\u000aPopularize integrated farming system by combining crop, livestock and fisheries\u000a\u000aProvide shades by planting trees in fields to avoid heat stress affect on crops\u000a\u000aADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR HEALTH:\u000a\u000aInititate research on impacts of climate change on vector, respiratory and water borne diseases\u000a\u000aDevelop nutrition policy\u000a\u000aIntegrate climate change in health disaster risk reduction plans for cyclones, floods and droughts\u000a\u000aADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR POWER:\u000a\u000aIncrease share of renewable in grid power by 20% by 2020\u000a\u000aMake rooftop solar water heating modules compulsory\u000a\u000aUndertake research to assess the impacts of climate change on power infrastructure

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), an international organisation offering technical consultation, training, and information services for capacity building and support to local governments in the implementation of sustainable development will soon come out with an action plan to reduce carbon emissions in the city.\u000a\u000aThe action plan is being drawn up as part of a project taken up by ICLEI, South Asia, with the support of the British High Commission, to formulate urban climate guidelines focusing on clean technologies to build sustainable low carbon cities. Tiruchi is one of three cities along with Coimbatore and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu where the project has been taken up, apart from Jaipur, Udaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan.\u000a\u000aThe project also seeks to develop an India-specific greenhouse gas protocol and a monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system for carbon emission reduction in cities, besides trying to raise awareness of appropriate use of clean technologies among stakeholders.\u000a\u000aThe project would strive to enable the cities to follow the path of sustainable growth through the use of renewable energy such as solar, wind, biomass and hybrid systems and achieving energy efficiency in households, government buildings, institutions and commercial establishments.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives of the ICLEI made a presentation on the draft action plan at a stakeholders meeting, chaired by Mayor A.Jaya, at Tiruchi Corporation on Friday. The meeting was attended by representatives of various government departments, industry and trade organisations and voluntary agencies.\u000a\u000aThe project would focus on residential, commercial, industrial and government sectors, and come out with strategies for promoting renewable energy and achieving energy efficiency in households, government buildings, street lighting, water supply, sewerage system and transportation. It would also suggest strategies for use of renewable energy in hotels, hospitals, educational institutions and commercial/industrial establishments.\u000a\u000aThe project will come out with a report on financing opportunities for low carbon initiatives.\u000a\u000aAsish Varma, Senior Project Officer, ICLEI, told The Hindu, that the guidelines and a final action plan would be prepared within the next 15 days after taking information from the stakeholders. ICLEI would also assist the corporation in implementing a few pilot projects.\u000a\u000aAt the meeting, Ms.Jaya said the corporation would initiate steps to promote renewable energy systems in the city. It has already taken up a project to convert all streetlights into compact fluorescent lamps in Golden Rock Zone. The civic body would also take up a pilot project to install solar energy systems at its buildings and also strive to raise the awareness levels among residents.\u000a\u000aCommissioner V.P.Thandapani said as per a recent government directive installation of solar water heaters would be made mandatory for new buildings in the city. Commercial establishments would also be advised to go in for solar water heaters.\u000a\u000aC.Chellakrishnan, manager, Ali Adil, research officer, ICLEI, Asick Meera, Deputy Mayor, and Corporation Executive Engineers R.Chandran and S.Arunchalam attended the meeting.

VThick smoke shrouds the Waldo Canyon in Colorado Springs earlier this week. (Reuters) June 29 (Reuters): Scorching heat, high winds and bone-dry conditions are fuelling catastrophic wildfires in the US West that offer a preview of the kind of disasters that human-caused climate change could bring, scientists have said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a window into what global warming really looks like,\u201d Princeton University\u2019s Michael Oppenheimer said during a telephone media briefing. \u201cIt looks like heat, it looks like fires, it looks like this kind of environmental disaster. This provides vivid images of what we can expect to see more of in the future.\u201d The briefing was convened by the science organisation Climate Communication, with logistical support by Climate Nexus, an advocacy and communications group. The Colorado wildfire, which has forced the evacuation of 35,000 people, killed at least one person and incinerated 346 homes, is the most destructive blaze in the state\u2019s history, officials said. As winter snowpack was lighter than usual and melted sooner, fire season started earlier in the US West, with wildfires out of control in Colorado, Montana and Utah. The high temperatures that are helping drive these fires are consistent with projections by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which said this kind of extreme heat, with little cooling overnight, is one kind of damaging impact of global warming. Others include more severe storms, floods and droughts, Oppenheimer said. The stage was set for these fires when winter snowpack was lighter than usual, said Steven Running, a forest ecologist at the University of Montana. Mountain snows melted an average of two weeks earlier than normal this year, Running said. \u201cThat just sets us up for a longer, dryer summer. Then all you need is an ignition source and wind.\u201d Warmer-than-usual winters also allow tree-killing mountain pine beetles to survive the winter and attack western forests, leaving behind dry wood to fuel wildfires earlier in the season, Running said. \u201cNow we have a lot of dead trees to burn... it\u2019s not even July yet,\u201d he said. Trying to stop such blazes driven by high winds is a bit like to trying to stop a hurricane, Running said: \u201cThere is nothing to stop that kind of holocaust.\u201d Fires cost about $1 billion or more a year, and exact a toll on human health, ranging from increased risk of heart, lung and kidney ailments to post-traumatic stress disorder, said Howard Frumkin, a public health expert at the University of Washington. \u201cWildfire smoke is like intense air pollution,\u201d Frumkin said. \u201cPollution levels can reach many times higher than a bad day in Mexico City or Beijing.\u201d The elderly, the very young and the ill are most vulnerable to the heat that adds to wildfire risk, he said.

VThe Stern Report on climate change, produced for the British government in 2006, predicted that the overall costs of will be equivalent to losing at least five per cent of global gross domestic product every year.\u000a\u000aAnd this is where lean thinking comes together with the need to \u2018go green\u2019 (be that in the conservation of energy and resources or the reduction of carbon emissions). Lean thinking, which is already built into the best companies\u2019 DNA, argues that \u2018less is more\u2019: not less in the sense of limiting consumption, but ensuring that the process of production uses fewer natural resources. A lean approach to manufacturing will cut out waste and inefficiency (saving those scarce natural resources), enabling the process to be redesigned so that it becomes more sustainable, while the products retain their quality and are cheaper to make. A lean approach is rooted in measuring the use (and waste) of resources, and that information \u2014 about the amount of carbon that has been emitted during a product\u2019s manufacture and distribution, for example \u2014 can then help consumers make \u2018green choices\u2019.\u000a\u000aTake concentrated washing detergent, for instance. Traditional washing detergent is bulky and heavy, requires a good deal of packaging and is expensive to transport \u2014 all of which eats into the profits of the companies which make and sell it. Concentrated washing detergent, by contrast, is a much more economic prospect, requiring less packaging and therefore costing less to transport \u2014 it also allows clothes to be washed at lower temperatures, thereby reducing energy consumption. It has been calculated that if everyone in the world switched to using it, we could reduce CO2 emissions by over 4 million tonnes, the equivalent of taking one million cars off the road.\u000a\u000aThis shows the power, economic effectiveness and potential of lean thinking: remove the waste \u2014 unnecessary packaging and travel costs \u2014 and you save money and cut carbon. Toyota\u2019s Ohno knew he needed to get the maximum from the resources he had. In essence, that\u2019s the challenge we have on a global scale today. Lean thinking provides us with the route to be green and to consume, and for our economies to grow.\u000a\u000aMany would disagree with the premise underlying that statement. They would argue that one answer to the problems we face \u2014 the impact of a growing population on our environment, and \u2014 is to cut back consumption. They point out that if we continue with the current rate of consumption, our planet will require the natural resources of three planets the same size. They believe we have no choice but to back-pedal: governments should tax more, people should consume less and economies should grow more slowly, if at all. In their eyes, most major corporations \u2014 manufacturers, retailers and so on \u2014 are the enemy, and are responsible for greedily and inefficiently using up the planet\u2019s resources. Even when those companies have sought to claim green credentials they have often been treated with scepticism, their initiatives being dismissed as nothing more than PR-grabbing \u2018greenwash\u2019. (In fairness, the charge has sometimes been justified.)\u000a\u000aThis is an understandable view, but in my mind it carries with it an intractable problem of its own: it\u2019s difficult to reverse hundreds of years of material progress in the West, and it\u2019s very hard indeed to justify denying progress to developing nations. Arguably, an attempt to hold back consumption will hit the poor much harder than the rich.\u000a\u000aThere is an alternative, and that is for us to learn how to maintain and even increase consumption sustainably. For me, this is the only realistic option, as the irrepressible desire for a better life is part of human nature. History is full of failed attempts to stamp on that wish and give up on our innate craving for personal security, well-being and progress.\u000a\u000aSustainable consumption depends on people accepting and living by the underlying principle of lean thinking: that less is more. This does not mean having to accept \u2018less\u2019 of what they desire, but desiring goods and services that use fewer natural resources. It means making it easier, cheaper and more logical for consumers to go green \u2014 to save energy themselves and to buy green goods. And it requires no less than a complete rebuilding of the entire supply chain to make it lean.\u000a\u000aSo much for the theory. What did this mean for a company such as Tesco in practice? For a start, we had to operate in a lean manner, rooting out wasteful activity that consumed unnecessary resources throughout our operations. The total of all direct emissions from Tesco\u2019s UK operations alone adds up to some 2.5 million tonnes of carbon: that compares with around 36 million tonnes emitted by the many businesses which supply Tesco\u2019s UK operations. So we set ourselves a challenging target to reduce carbon emissions across our global supply chain by 30 per cent by 2020. Overall, we wanted Tesco to be a zero-carbon business by 2050 \u2014 which means that any carbon the business still emits will be matched by extra renewable energy that Tesco generates for others to use. To the cynical, that might sound like a publicity ploy, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that Tesco\u2019s annual gas and electricity bill for the UK alone was 200 million in 2011. The measures we have so far put in place are now reducing the company\u2019s global energy bill by 150 million annually.\u000a\u000aVarious practical steps were \u2014 and are still being \u2014 taken to bring about greater efficiency. We started to relocate our depots to bring them closer to the stores they service; we looked at the design of our lorries to make them more aerodynamic, thereby saving fuel. Much of our focus, though, was on the stores themselves, which account for around 70 per cent of Tesco\u2019s emissions.\u000a\u000aLean thinking started to be applied to store design back in the mid-1990s, and by 2007 we were building new stores that used only half the energy of ones built ten years earlier. But to be zero carbon by 2050 required radical new thinking, not incremental change. We therefore took our whole approach apart and scrutinised our processes closely. In doing so we discovered, to our horror, that only 14 per cent of the average Tesco store was recycled when rebuilding was required. This seemed unjustifiably wasteful. Consequently we introduced a target to reuse everything, setting ourselves the challenge of designing new stores that will be as easy to dismantle and reuse as they are to assemble. (At one store we managed to reuse almost 60 per cent of the materials we shipped out \u2014 a big change in well under ten years.) Bearing in mind that, thanks to daily wear and tear, the average Tesco store has no more than a 3o-year life, this offers the prospect of huge future savings.\u000a\u000aWe also wanted to see whether we could achieve our goal of becoming a zero-carbon company immediately, by actually building a zero-carbon store. This was quite a challenge. A modern store has evolved over time and balances carefully all of its many functions. A busy store serves 50,000 customers a week. It may have a turnover of 2 million a week. Something like 200,000 cases of goods containing 40,000 different types of products have to be ordered, delivered, unpacked, displayed and sold. So every store must fulfil the needs of both customers and staff alike.\u000a\u000aThinking \u2018lean\u2019, we looked at an entire store\u2019s operations, measuring emissions from all its activities. We were helped by work at our Cheetham Hill store, where we had researched how to save energy and cut carbon. We found that, of the heat used in this store, 37 per cent was lost by ventilation and 8 per cent was lost through the building fabric. As far as electricity was concerned, 23 per cent was used for lighting. Refrigeration was the biggest problem. Refrigerators removed 54 per cent of the store\u2019s heat and consumed 37 per cent of its electricity.\u000a\u000aWe used these insights to design our new zero-carbon store. Out went steel and concrete and in came timber. Out went halogen and fluorescent lights, in came \u2014 a pioneering move for a retailer. In, too, came natural light and natural ventilation \u2014 a return to older, more traditional building designs which had to make clever use of nature to light, heat and cool buildings because there was no mechanical alternative. We insulated the store and changed the type of glass to lessen heat gain and loss (which requires artificial heating and cooling). We designed completely new refrigeration systems, using different gases which did less environmental damage, and we put doors on all our fridges.\u000a\u000aWe also needed a renewable power source big enough to power the store. So we developed a combined heat and power plant. Powered by reusing waste vegetable oil from food manufacturing, the unit produced enough surplus power for nearby housing.\u000a\u000aThe outcome of all this was the world\u2019s first zero-carbon store, opened in 2009 near Cambridge. It operated as we had hoped and met its targets. Just as importantly, customers liked the store, in part because the timber construction created a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere. All the innovations were explained on signage around the store, which reassured customers about its impact on the environment.\u000a\u000ain 10 Words by (Random House, Rs 499).

VLONDON: Rising sea levels cannot be stopped over the next several hundred years even if deep emissions cuts lower global average temperatures , but they can be slowed down, climate scientists said in a study on Sunday.A lot of climate research shows that rising greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for increasing global average surface temperatures by about 0.17 degrees Celsius a decade from 1980-2010 and for a sea level rise of about 2.3mm a year from 2005-2010 as ice caps and glaciers melt.Rising sea levels threaten about a tenth of the world's population who live in low-lying areas and islands which are at risk of flooding.More than 180 countries are negotiating a new climate pact which will come into force by 2020 and force all nations to cut emissions to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius this century.But even if the most ambitious emission cuts are made, it might not be enough, said scientists at the United States National Centre for Atmospheric Research, US research organisation Climate Central and Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research in Melbourne.This is because as warmer temperatures penetrate deep, the water warms and expands as the heat mixes through different ocean regions.

VLeatherback turtles, the largest sea turtle species on Earth, could be wiped out completely if global temperatures continues to rise unabated, a new study has claimed.\u000a\u000aAccording to the new study, published in journal Nature Climate Change, deaths of turtle eggs and hatchlings in nests buried at hotter, drier beaches are the leading projected cause of the potential climate-related decline.\u000a\u000aLeatherbacks are among the most critically endangered due to a combination of historical and ongoing threats, including egg poaching at nesting beaches and juvenile and adult turtles being caught in fishing operations.\u000a\u000aThe research by a team from Drexel University, Princeton University and other institutions suggests that climate change could impede this creature\u2019s ability to recover.\u000a\u000aIf actual climate patterns follow projections in the study, the eastern Pacific leatherback turtles will decline by 75 per cent in numbers by the year 2100, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aLeatherback turtle births naturally ebb and flow from year to year in response to climate variations, with more hatchlings, and rare pulses of male hatchlings, entering the eastern Pacific Ocean in cooler, rainier years.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 1990, there were 1,500 turtles nesting on the Playa Grande beach,\u201d said study co-author Dr James Spotila of the Drexel University. \u201cNow, there are 30 to 40 nesting females per season.\u201d

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aSea levels may rise much higher than previously thought, as a new study on fossil corals has found that warmer climes in the past promoted dramatic melting of polar ice.\u000a\u000aResearchers built an extensive database by compiling age and elevation data of fossil corals that live near the sea surface, using a model to factor in the physics of how changing masses of ice sheets would affect regional sea level at the various fossil coral sites, a statement from the Australian National University said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn this way, we were able to account for the geographic variability in sea level observations from this time period and compute the highest point that average global sea level attained. The observations from the corals confirmed the sea level patterns that we predicted using the geophysical model,\u201d Andrea Dutton, who is currently based at University of Florida, said.\u000a\u000aThe research concluded that sea level during the last interglacial period peaked at 5.5 to 9 metres above present sea level.\u000a\u000a\u201cSea level change \u2014 in the past, present, and future \u2014 is geographically variable and we must consider this variability to infer what the average global sea level was doing in the past.

VNEW DELHI: Most glaciers on the Tibetan plateau and around it are rapidly melting says the latest study based on 30 years of satellite data and also actual measurements. This upturns results of a study published earlier this year based on satellite measurements over seven years which said that Tibetan glaciers are growing.\u000a\u000aThe most recent study was done by Chinese glaciologists and is published in the latest issue of scientific journal Nature Climate Change.\u000a\u000aThe Tibetan plateau and the mountain ranges radiating from it - the Himalayas, the Karakoram, the Pamir and the Qilian - contain 100,000 square kilometres of glaciers that supply water to about 1.4 billion people in Asia through huge river systems like the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus, Mekong, Yangtze etc. This gigantic collection of freshwater - mostly ice - has led many to call the region the Third Pole of the Earth. Global warming and related climate changes may cause reduction of water in this gigantic lifeline affecting billions.\u000a\u000aThe Chinese scientists analysed satellite measurements of the lengths and surface areas of about 7,100 glaciers. They also physically measured 15 glaciers for decades in order to confirm the net changes taking place. They found that the majority of the glaciers have been shrinking rapidly across the studied area in the past 30 years, and at accelerating rates.\u000a\u000aSo what explains the fact that other studies have come up with different results? According to this study, there is a large variation in different parts of the Third Pole. For instance, glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating faster on average than those in the Karakoram and the Pamir. And the reason for this was discovered in an unexpected factor - wind.\u000a\u000aStudying climate records of the entire region, the scientists found that changes in the glaciers depend on whether the ice is under the influence of the Indian monsoon or the westerlies, the winds blowing in from the West, that is, from Europe.\u000a\u000aIn the Karakoram and the Pamir plateau, the westerlies are dominant and the glaciers grow by accumulating winter snow. So, they are less affected by warming because temperatures in winter are still below zero, says the study. In the eastern and central Himalayas it snows mainly during monsoon and a slight increase in summer temperatures can affect glaciers drastically.\u000a\u000aAs the Indian monsoon has grown weaker in the past few decades, and the westerlies have gained strength, the western part of the region has seen glacier increases while the central and Eastern part - mainly the Himalayas and Tibet - have lost ice from their glaciers.\u000a\u000aThe study also found that there has been a 26% increase in the area covered by glacial lakes, formed from melting glaciers, in the region since the 1970s. The earlier GRACE study which announced that glaciers were increasing in size could have been misled by these lakes says the present study because it was measuring gravity pull by satellite and would not have been able to distinguish between water and ice.\u000a\u000aJohn Wahr, a remote-sensing expert at the University of Colorado Boulder and lead author of the GRACE study, was quoted by Nature as concedinf that the criticism is valid.

VIndia\u2019s agricultural research system seems well poised to tackle head-on. Apart from gearing itself up for meeting the immediate challenges with the available technologies and knowledge, it is also putting in place a hi-tech, multi-disciplinary research infrastructure to provide the research-and-development backing required for combating climate extremes in the future. Some of the technical facilities being created for this purpose are unique in Asia, if not in the whole world.\u000a\u000aThis preparedness is part of the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) launched by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in February 2011. This project, being implemented with the active participation of 21 research institutes and most state agricultural universities, is being coordinated by the Hyderabad-based Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) under the supervision of the natural resource management division of\u000a\u000aThe basic and strategic research being conducted under will strengthen the farm sector\u2019s defences against Technologies for facing situation-specific threats are being demonstrated to farmers in vulnerable districts. Scientists and other officials are also being trained.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, automatic weather data collection stations are being set up in farm research centres at district level to gather agriculture-specific, real-time weather information for local use and sharing exclusively among farm research institutes. A satellite ground station has been established at New Delhi\u2019s Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) to receive data relating to atmosphere, land and ocean directly from the \u201cX\u201d and \u201cL\u201d band polar-orbiting satellites for purely agricultural applications. \u201cThis is the first such system being established in an agricultural research set-up anywhere in the world,\u201d says Dr A K Singh, ICAR\u2019s deputy director-general (natural resources), who is overseeing the project. This system can be used for monitoring crop condition and putting out early warnings about weather aberrations and other kinds of stresses that might affect crop yields.\u000a\u000aA distinct feature of NICRA, which sets it apart from projects in other countries, is that it is not confined to crops alone but extends also to livestock and fisheries. Genetic traits of different livestock breeds are being screened vis--vis their susceptibility to variable weather. A well-equipped fisheries research vessel has begun operating in the ocean for monitoring the effect of climate change on fish species. New Zealand is perhaps the only other country that is assessing the impact of climate change on livestock.\u000a\u000aThis aside, ultra-modern environment observation equipments (technically called Eddy Covariance Flux Towers) have been built to monitor the emission of green house gases (GHGs). Besides major GHGs, like methane and carbon dioxide, these centres are also keeping a watch on the nitrous-oxide level of the atmosphere, especially in high fertiliser-consuming areas.\u000a\u000aFour farm research centres, located in Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangaluru and Baramati, have been equipped to utilise the science of phenomics (that studies how the physical and biochemical traits of organisms react to genetic and environmental influences) to screen germplasm for their ability to withstand stresses like drought, water-logging, heat, cold and so on.\u000a\u000aAbout 22,000 strains have been identified that possess the desired genes for resistance against climate change-induced stresses. And, to top it all, special contingency plans focused on the microclimate of areas that are at high risk have been prepared for over 300 districts. Selected villages or village-clusters in many of these districts are already being assisted in putting these plans into action.\u000a\u000aArea-specific weather and technology advisories are being communicated to famers twice every week. This is believed to be the world\u2019s largest programme to reach out to farmers on climate change-related issues. All this makes a rare kind of agriculture-centred climate change intervention programme. Since the research outcomes of NICRA will be available to the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, one of the several national missions created under the government\u2019s flagship National Action Plan on Climate Change, it is now for this mission to promote these technologies on a country-wide scale.\u000a\u000asurinder.sud@gmail.com

VNEW DELHI: More farmers are using weather insurance to mitigate risks from climate change. Top two weather insurers -- Agricultural Insurance Corporation (AIC) and ICICI Lombard -- say business is growing at 25% annually and now covers more than 200 districts across 21 states.\u000a\u000a"The growth has been so spectacular over the past five years that as many as 12 million farmers, growing crops on over 15 million hectares of cropped area, might have been insured during the 2011-12 crop year," said KN Rao, deputy general manager, AIC, which enjoys over 75% market share in this insurance category.While the state-owned AIC covers almost all the designated districts, its nearest competitor ICICI Lombard is present in 11 states, covering over 50 districts. According to Union agriculture ministry, five insurance companies including AIC, ICICI Lombard, Iffco-Tokio and Cholamandlam MS offer insurance to farmers based on monsoon data."Uncertainty over monsoon and frequent climate changes have made it necessary for farmers to go for weather-based insurance. This provides them the much-needed cover and helps them withstand financial stress, which may happen due to crop loss," said RS Sharma, senior agri-scientist, Agricultural Policy Research Institute Weather insurance was formally introduced in 2003 as a pilot, and by 2007 the government adopted it as an alternative to the existing yield index insurance. Around 40 crops are insured under the category for various climatic phenomena like deficit rainfall, dry-spell, excess rainfall, low temperature, high temperature, high humidity, and high wind.The premium rates are capped for the cultivator and the premium (rates) beyond the cap are shared by the Centre and concerned state government on 50:50 basis."The premium rates for farmers depend on various crops. For wheat, it is capped at 1.5% while for other food crops, it is 2.0%," said an AIC official.With the rising popularity of weather-based insurance, the premium business as well as beneficiaries has also gone up over the past few years."In the 2010-11 crop year, premium collection was around Rs 1,300 crore while the claim was around Rs 635 crore, benefitting 43.29 lakh farmers. In 2011-12, the premium collection went up to around Rs 1,850 crore while the claims and beneficiaries increased to Rs 887 crore and 46 lakh farmers, respectively," said an AIC official.However, weather insurance has its own challenges while catering to over 25-crore farmers in the country."One of the key challenges in weather index insurance has been establishing an adequate network of weather stations to service weather insurance as a credible insurance programme. It is estimated that the country needs around 8,000 automatic weather stations and about 32,000 rain gauges to effectively service the index insurance compared to the current network of 5,000," added Rao.

We have to deal with the consequences of global warming at home,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aDr Basu underscored the need for changes to the micro-economic incentives to enable India to switch to a low carbon growth economy. This assumes significance considering the fact that developing countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\u000a\u000aHe also promised an expanded coverage on climate change in the next year's edition of Economic Survey. For the first-time, the Economic Survey released in February had a dedicated section on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe Economic Affairs Secretary, Mr R. Gopalan, said that the 12th Plan will have as one of its key pillars a low carbon growth strategy. \u201cOne must bear in mind these actions are voluntarily proposed despite the fact that India does not have legally binding commitment under the global climate change regime,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe underscored the need for State governments and local bodies to also be a part of the climate change response. Mr Gopalan noted that various central ministries had already formed units to address climate change issues.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIndia has joined the U.S. and 15 other major countries in opposing European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) which requires carriers flying to or from Europe to offset their carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aThe two-day meeting hosted by the United States to chalk out a common strategy against the E.U.\u2019s emission trading scheme concluded on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey (India) have been clear both in that meeting and any number of times thereafter that they are strongly opposed to the application of the ETS and have had quite strong and vigorous words concerning the application of the ETS to foreign carriers,\u201d a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aSince the meeting was held under what is called \u201cChatham House Rules\u201d \u2014 which is to say people are encouraged to speak freely and candidly because what they say isn\u2019t going to be reported afterwards \u2014 the senior administration official was not at the liberty to divulge India\u2019s point of view during the meeting.\u000a\u000aIndia, in fact, has hosted meetings against E.U.\u2019s ETS in New Delhi in the past.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo I think you can get a pretty good flavour of where India stands, looking at other things that they\u2019ve said, but I\u2019m not going to discuss what they said in this meeting,\u201d the official said, noting that probably every country outside of Europe has opposed the emission trading system on both legal and policy grounds.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut at the same time as we have opposed the application of the ETS in that manner, we have been strongly supportive and many countries strongly supportive of the objective of reducing emissions from aviation,\u201d the official noted.\u000a\u000aThe meeting was convened in Washington with a group of major aviation countries for supporting the process of making progress on reducing emissions in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which is the multilateral body charged with handling international aviation.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe wanted to bring that group together to discuss ongoing progress and continued progress that can be made and also to explore whether there seemed to be some basis for an overall global solution that would have the additional effect of causing the E.U.\u2019s ETS to be set aside with regard to foreign carriers,\u201d the U.S. official said.\u000a\u000aThe meeting confirmed the very solid and strong opposition to the ETS as applied to foreign carriers, but also indicated that there was a lot of interest among countries in continuing to work on the suite of activities that ICAO has been working on.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd those include developing a CO2 efficiency standard for aircraft and engines.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was, in that respect, a quite important development just within the last week or so from the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protections known as CAEP,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aExperts are also working on the development of the global standards needed to enhance the improvement of airline operations, things like air traffic management, which are actually enormously important, a big part of reducing emissions, the official added.\u000a\u000aAccording to the U.S. official, a trading system by itself doesn\u2019t cause aviation emissions to get reduced.\u000a\u000aIt might cause airlines to go into the market and buy reductions, buy allowances from their governments if the governments are supplying them or from other businesses, but there are a whole lot of steps that airlines can take \u2014 more efficient airplanes and airplane engines, much better air traffic management operations, the development of alternative fuels, the official argued.

VFrom \u2018Grey to Green,\u2019 the initiative started in 2008 as a response to the challenge of climate change by Tata Companies, has germinated in a new form.\u000a\u000aTata Chemicals has deployed German-designed and patented Lupa bulkers to help reduce carbon footprint and curb the usage of plastic bags for packaging.\u000a\u000aA part of the $83.5-billion Tata Group, Tata Chemicals is looking at harnessing the fruits of science for goals that go beyond business. For the world\u2019s second-largest producer of soda ash, it is chemistry with a conscience. The green supply chain strategy for soda ash is the first for any chemical company in India.\u000a\u000aTata Chemicals will ensure that the transportation of loose soda ash is undertaken by Lupa bulkers worth Rs 45 lakh.\u000a\u000aSpecially designed bulk freighters\u000a\u000aThe bulk freighters are specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo and are mounted on trucks. It is a vessel used to load and unload cargo through air pressure. Soda ash is transported worldwide in loose conditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe significance of this bulker is that it primarily helps to reduce Co2 emissions as the use of plastic bags are avoided altogether,\u201d said a company representative.\u000a\u000aThe bulker is already in operation at Tata Chemicals\u2019 Mithapur plant in Gujarat. Each bulker has an approximate capacity of 25 tonnes and can replace three million plastic bags each year.\u000a\u000aThe company plans to incorporate 10 more bulkers in FY12-13.\u000a\u000aThough it brings on ease of operation, with a pressurised discharge and no possibility of contamination, it is also cost effective and economical in a limited radius to the supplier and receiver.\u000a\u000aMeher Hermanns, which is present in India for the last 12 years, makes the Lupa bulkers. The company is an Indian arm of Hermanns Silo GmbH, Germany.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s comprehensive international structure tackles bulk material handling.\u000a\u000aTypically in the chemicals industry, most bulk chemicals are transported in a packed form, whereas some of the liquid chemicals are transported in tankers. \u201cIn the near-term, we are targeting 1,50,000 mt of movement of soda ash by bulkers which will help in Co2 reduction, since there will be no usage of plastic bags and material handling equipment. We are also planning other alternate and innovative modes for long distance bulk movement of soda ash,\u201d said Zarir Langrana, COO, Tata Chemicals.\u000a\u000aTata Chemicals is working on long-term sustainability goals with annual targets. On carbon footprint, the goal is to achieve 20 per cent reduction in carbon intensity of its products by 2020.\u000a\u000a> amritanair.ghaswalla@thehindu.co.in

VNEW DELHI: The icy wastes of Antarctica were once covered with lush vegetation where palm and baobab like trees waved in the breeze. This is not science fiction - evidence for this lost world was discovered by scientists recently.On the eastern coast of the vast continent that covers the South Pole region, in a place called Wilkes Land, scientists drilled through the four kilometers of ice and another one kilometer down below the ground. They found pollen and certain natural chemicals that could only have come from certain tree species.Also discovered were tiny single-celled organisms called Archaea. Their cell walls contain chemicals that were frozen when they were buried in ice - and thus they give an idea of the time elapsed.Evidence suggests that while the coastal and lowland regions had palm, baobab and macadamia like trees, more inland and on higher slopes, conifers and beech trees swathed the terrain.The drilling was carried out by a multi-national team of scientists under the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Their findings are published in the scientific journal Nature yesterday.The effort drew plaudits from scientists in another part of Anarctica who are spending the seven month long sun-less winter there in an isolated station run by the European Space Agency. When informed of the study results, Alexander Kumar, told TOI by email from the Concordia Base Station in the Antarctica, that Antarctica was a place of dreams and nightmares, especially in science.Temperatures in Antarctica are currently running at below -80 degrees Celsius and below -100C windchill, according to Kumar. To imagine that this hostile environment was once a lush jungle is very difficult."I went to bed last night dreaming of Arthur Conan Doyle's 'Lost World' - beneath the 3233 metres of ice below my bed, lies a hidden, ancient jungle!" said Kumar.According to the study, about 53 million years ago the Earth was passing through what could be called an intense, natural phase of global warming . Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were touching 600 parts per million (ppm) - much higher than today's dangerous 390 ppm. As a result most of the Earth, including the two polar regions were covered with dense vegetation, despite being in darkness for half the year.About 34 million years ago, glaciation wiped out the plants and the ice sheet cover became permanent.According to Kumar, this discovery will help us understand climate change better. It shows the kind of Earth that will exist if the present manmade global warming does not get checked soon.Kumar also warned against indiscriminate attempts at exploitation of natural resources in Antarctica."As the population climbs and natural resources dwindle in common sites across the world, companies will move into Antarctica as they have done to the Arctic. If the world climbs aboard Antarctica, it will sink," he warnsCurrently, human activity is loosely regulated by the Antarctic Treaty, which will be up for renewal in around 35 years.

VDrilling of the seabed off Antarctica has revealed that rainforest grew on the frozen continent 52 million years ago, scientists said on Thursday, warning it could be ice-free again within decades.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe study of sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor off Antarctica's east coast revealed fossil pollens that had come from a "near-tropical" forest covering the continent in the Eocene period, 34-56 million years ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aKevin Welsh, an Australian scientist who travelled on the 2010 expedition, said analysis of temperature-sensitive molecules in the cores had showed it was "very warm" 52 million years ago, measuring about 20 degrees Celsius (68 F).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"There were forests existing on the land, there wouldn't have been any ice, it would have been very warm," Welsh told AFP of the study, published in the journal Nature.\u000a\u000a"It's quite surprising, because obviously our image of Antarctica is that it's very cold and full of ice."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWelsh said higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were thought to be the major driver of the heat and ice-free conditions on Antarctica, with CO2 estimates of anywhere between 990 to "a couple of thousand" parts per million.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCO2 is presently estimated at about 395ppm, and Welsh said the most extreme predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would see ice again receding on Antarctica \u201cby the end of the century\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say, because that's really controlled by people's and governments' actions,\u201d said Welsh, a paleoclimatologist from the University of Queensland. \u201cIt really depends on how emissions go in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWelsh described the findings as "very significant" in understanding future climate change, particularly given how important Antarctica and the "very large" volume of water stored on its surface would be for the entire planet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"It shows that if we go through periods of higher CO2 in the atmosphere it's very likely that there will be dramatic changes on these very important areas of the globe where ice currently exists," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"If we were to lose a lot of ice from Antarctica then we're going to see a dramatic change in sea level all around the planet." Even a few metres of sea level rise would inundate \u201clarge portions of the habitable land around coasts of many major countries and low-lying regions\u201d, he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ice on east Antarctica is 3-4 kilometres (1.9-25 miles) thick, and is thought to have formed about 34 million years ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWelsh said there would also be major impacts to global temperatures were the ice to recede, because it is an integral cooling mechanism for the planet, regulating the temperature by reflecting the sun's energy into space.

VBANGALORE: The United States is allegedly using the climate 'fast start financing' to its pervert advantage for ruining the Indian domestic solar photo-voltaic (PV) manufacturing industry, if a statement made by the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is to be believed. Currently, 80 per cent of the Indian manufacturing capacity is in a state of forced closure and debt restructuring with no orders coming to them, while the US manufacturers are getting orders from Indian solar power developers, said CSE's researchers.As the nation's ambitious Solar Mission's first phase draws to a close next year, CSE is analysing the state of renewable energy resources and infrastructure in India and the country's preparedness to meet the Mission goals."Fast start financing is a US $30 billion fund set up under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The fund, adopted at the Copenhagen climate meeting in 2009, is supposed to help developing countries deal with climate change impacts and limit greenhouse gas emissions," said Chandra Bhushan , CSE deputy director general.The Government of India has been aggressively promoting solar power projects since 2010 as part the National Action Plan on climate change. Within three years, from 2009-12, India has gone from an almost zero to close to 1,000 MW of solar installations in the country.

VWASHINGTON: Climate change could pose high risk of avian flu virus transmission in wild birds, a new study has warned.Ecologists from the University of Michigan used a math model to explore the consequences of altered interactions between an important species of migratory shorebird and horseshoe crabs at Delaware Bay as a result of climate change.They found that climate change could upset the carefully choreographed interactions between ruddy turnstone shorebirds and the horseshoe crabs that provide the bulk of their food during the birds' annual stopover.Climate change caused disruptions to the well-timed interplay between the birds and crabs could lead to an increase in the avian flu infection rate among ruddy turnstones and resident ducks, a Michigan University statement said.Researchers say because Delaware Bay is a crossroads for many bird species traveling between continents, an increase in the avian infection rate there could conceivably help spread novel subtypes of the influenza virus among North American wild bird populations."We're not suggesting that our findings necessarily indicate an increased risk to human health," said Rohani, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, a professor of complex systems and a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health."But every single pandemic influenza virus that has been studied has included gene segments from avian influenza viruses. So from that perspective, understanding avian influenza transmission in its natural reservoir is, in itself, very important," Rohani said.Avian flu refers to infection with bird flu Type A viruses. Such viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.These viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred.Since 2003, more than 600 cases, including more than 300 human deaths owing to infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 , have been reported worldwide, the report said.

VMUMBAI: Emergent Ventures India (EVI) has registered its solar programme of activity (PoA)__National Solar Power Development Programme, India (NSPDP)__with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). With this registration, new grid connected solar power projects can be added to this PoA without the risk of not registering before December 2012, which marks the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aClean Development Mechanism (CDM) provides a promising area, where additional revenues can be harnessed for renewable energy projects to increase their viability. However, the main hurdles faced by the small scale project developers, especially those developing solar power projects are high costs and long time for registration in the CDM process.\u000a\u000aMoreover, the credits from standalone projects registering after December 2012 will be not be eligible to trade in EU ETS which is currently the largest market of carbon credits. To overcome these hurdles particularly faced by small scale projects, EVI has registered this CDM PoA,'' EVI said.\u000a\u000aA solar power project added to this PoA can be registered in a much shorter span and at a reduced cost. It is expected that the registration time will be reduced to about 40% of what it takes to register a standalone CDM project. Typical cost is also expected to be less than 60% of that of a standalone CDM project.\u000a\u000aThe company is now fully geared to extend this PoA facility to solar power project developers,'' EVI added.\u000a\u000aEVI, which was founded in 1999, started its climate business in 2004. It provides consulting and implementation services to around 350 clients in carbon, sustainability and renewables domain across the world.

VNEW DELHI: The focus of energy efficiency has usually been large buildings, whether residential or commercial. Now, there is a project that will help smaller buildings reduce their carbon footprint. An offshoot of GRIHA \u2014 the green rating for integrated habitat assessment \u2014 SVAGRIHA has been conceptualized especially for buildings that are less than 2,500 sq m.The project was launched earlier this year by The Energy and Resources Institute ( TERI ) and new and renewable energy ministry. According to Mili Majumdar, director of TERI\u2019s sustainable habitat division, the cumulative contribution of energy guzzling small buildings to climate change is quite large which is why the need was felt to draw up a focused programme for this kind of architecture. \u201cUnlike GRIHA where a building is evaluated on 34 criteria, SVAGRIHA will evaluate buildings on 14 parameters. Once a building has been planned, the SVAGRIHA team will step in to advice on energy efficiency measures that can be adopted. People can also put up information about their buildings online and will get a list of steps that they can adopt suiting their needs,\u201d she said.In India, about 30% of the energy consumption is attributed to the buildings sector, out of which residential and commercial buildings contribute 24% and 6% respectively, says TERI. While GRIHA with its complex system of analysis was created for large establishments, there was a need to simplify the process for smaller buildings and also bring builders of tier 2 and 3 towns under the green rating umbrella. The cost of registration and evaluation for the projects will be between Rs 60,000 and Rs 1,00,000.The process for getting a SVAGRIHA rating includes registering with ADaRSH (Association for Development and Research of Sustainable Habitats), submission of calculations that determine possible energy efficient methods, drawings and other documents as required. The calculations, available on SVAGRIHA website, will use data like area under construction and quantity of material used. It will also provide recommendations to improve the environmental performance of the building.The submissions will be reviewed under SVAGRIHA parameters and a site visit will be carried out post construction to determine how and what measures have been put in place. Finally, a GRIHA certified evaluator will assess the building and award the rating.

VPUNE: A study by Holistic Child Development India, Pune has found that the print media has sidelined issues related to the effects of climate change on public health and on women and children. The adaptive capability of vulnerable sections of the population and measures that would help adaptation were also ignored, it found.\u000a\u000aThe study 'Print media and children: Give us more space: II'' states that environmental degradation and climate change are affecting people's lives and children, women and other marginalized sections are impacted severely by these changes. The six-month study was undertaken last year by students from schools in Pune, along with environmentalists. tnnThey selected the city editions of four national English newspapers for review from May to October 2011. Articles in these papers on climate change were analyzed for content to find out if the issues concerning children and women in relation to climate change were represented.\u000a\u000aThere was no editorial in the six-month study period related to climate change and its impact on the vulnerable section. The reports on the plight of children during crisis situations like droughts, floods, earthquakes and its impact on children's schooling, increased burden on children (fetching water, forced labour) were not reported, the study found.\u000a\u000aN Thomas Rajkumar, director of Holistic Child Development India, Pune, said that climate change affects the rights of children. The national action plan on climate change or the media do not discuss the views of children, he said.\u000a\u000aNaina Athalye, programme coordinator of children at high risk, pointed out that a similar study was done in 2007 and the findings were close. When we spoke to children, more than 90% said that they read the newspapers. So it plays a responsible role in creating awareness and should give more space to these issues. But in the study we found that the environmental rights of children like right to food, good air, clean water, among others were not addressed," she said.\u000a\u000aWe will plan a talk with the editors of national newspapers about the study and conduct a workshop for the media on child rights,'' she added.

VNEW DELHI: No nation can face the challenge of climate change alone. On that note, the fourth edition of the Earth Care Awards crossed borders to bring into its fold the Saarc nations. The award ceremony on Friday was hosted by The Times of India and the JSW Foundation in association with Centre for Environment Education The theme for this year\u2019s Earth Care Awards was \u201cAanchal\u201d and talked of the environment as the protective mother. She needs to be respected and protected now for future generations to enjoy nature\u2019s bounty. The awards were initiated in 2008 and have, each year since then, recognised and rewarded innovation in the field of sustainable development. This year, for the first time, the awards appreciated India\u2019s neighbours for their war against climate change. These nations, like India, are fighting for their rightful place in the world, but are focused on sustainable models of development.Chief guest for the evening, minister for environment and forests Jayanthi Natarajan , lauded The Times of India for bringing the work of environment crusaders into national focus. She said sustainability and growth are not separate cultures but complement each other. \u201cThere can be no development unless integrity of the land is preserved. We have to cherish , nourish and keep our resources very carefully so we can hand over a healthy planet earth to generations that follow.\u201dFor guest of honour, power minister Veerappa Moily, the road to sustainability is mapped in Gandhi\u2019s quote, \u201cEarth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed.\u201d He said much of the world\u2019s natural resources have perished because of a \u201ccrisis of character.\u201dThe awards celebrate people working tirelessly to address concerns facing our environment. Arunabh Das Sharma, BCCL president, welcoming the gathering , said: \u201cIt's a global problem but the harshest impact is felt in the Third World because to come out of poverty, they tend to over-consume and overwork resources.\u201d Forums such as this debate such issues. He added: \u201cThis work can't be in isolation so we' extended our hands to our neighbours this year.\u201dThe winners are ACC\u2019s Gagal Cement Works, Sri Lanka's Help-O , Bangladesh's ministry of forests and environment, Gujarat Energy Development Agency, Orchid Ecotel Hotel, NTPC\u2019s CeNPEEP, nonprofit Avani, Eco Task Force of the Garhwal Eco Warriors, Adya WiFi Metering and Coir Atlas.Sangita Jindal, chairperson of JSW Foundation said: \u201cWe are concerned about the environment but are encouraged by the many crusaders protecting Mother Earth. We have people living in hamlets striving to make our lives more liveable. It\u2019s important we recognise this work and give it publicity.\u201d The evening got off to an upbeat start with rock band EKA performing a special number Tere aanchal mein. Among those who attended were officials of the ministry of environment and forests ; ministry of power; high commissions of Bangladesh, Maldives, Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan; and embassies of Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Japan, Chile, US and Germany.A100-200 KW power plant that generates electricity from waste pine needles via 'gasification' .

VThe wind power industry, which has been subdued in terms of capacity addition since the beginning of the year, is now charged up with the prospect of revival of the generation-based incentive scheme (GBI).\u000a\u000aThanks to the repeated public statements made by the Ministry for New and Renewable Energy, Dr Farooq Abdullah, that a new GBI scheme will be announced, there is a sense of renewed optimism in the industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe scheme is being revived. We are working on it,\u201d Mr Anil K Jain, Advisor, Planning Commission, told Business Line on Saturday.\u000a\u000aThe scheme will give the much-needed boost to the industry, says Madhusudhan Khemka, Chairman and Managing Director of Regen Powertech Ltd, a leading manufacturer of wind turbines.\u000a\u000aThe MNRE has recommended to the Ministry of Finance that the government should give wind power producers 80 paise per unit of electricity generated by windmills, without any per-MW ceiling, for the next 15,000 MW of installed capacity. This scheme is therefore better than the one that prevailed until March, where the government gave a GBI of 50 paise per unit, capped at Rs 62 lakh per MW of installed capacity.\u000a\u000aOn the basis of its discussions with MNRE officials, the wind industry is certain that the Ministry of Finance will approve the scheme.\u000a\u000aBut\u2026.\u000a\u000aHowever, the only point of fret is whether the incentive will be applied prospectively, or retrospectively (i.e., from April).\u000a\u000aIf the scheme is only prospectively applied, then the 300-odd MW of capacity set up between April and now will be left out, which is not fair, says Ramesh Kymal, President of the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers\u2019 Association and Chairman and Managing Director of Gamesa India Pvt Ltd.\u000a\u000aThose who have put up capacities have done so on the basis of the belief they would also be eligible for GBI and banks have financed them on that basis, Kymal noted.\u000a\u000aThe industry seems less confident of restoration of the other sop that was removed from this year, viz., accelerated depreciation. (Under this scheme, those who put up wind turbines could charge 80 per cent depreciation of the value of the machines in their books for the purpose of computing taxable income.)\u000a\u000aHowever, there are a few other things that the government could do to help, says Vineeth Vijayaraghavan, Founder-Editor of Panchabuta, an online cleantech industry newsletter.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe government should provide an interest subvention to wind power developers but that should be linked to certain level of indigenisation, say 70 per cent, of the machines purchased,\u201d Vineeth says.\u000a\u000aLast year, India added 3,168 MW of wind power capacity, taking the total capacity across 17,000 MW. In the current year up to July, 540 MW have been added, but typically capacity additions would pick up steam in September. Industry observers such as Vineeth estimate that the capacity addition in 2012-13 would be around 2,300 MW\u2014lower than last year, but still substantially higher than earlier estimates.\u000a\u000a> ramesh.m@thehindu.co.in

VNEW DELHI: Northern parts of the country and the Himalayan region will be the worst hit by climate change in India and warming will be greater over land than sea, according to a latest report.\u000a\u000a"In the 2020s, the projected warming is of the order of 0.5-1.5 degree Celsius , by the 2050s, 3 degree celsius and by the 2080s, around 4 degree Celsius. Warming will be greater over land than sea and it is projected over northern parts of the Indian landmass and over the Himalayas," says a joint India-UK report on potential impact of climate change and adaptation in India which was launched here on Thursday .\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests worked together on a DECC-funded project to understand better the potential impacts of climate change in India and provide adaptation response options in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAccording to the report, the amount of rainfall from Indian monsoons is expected to be between 8.9-18.6 per cent higher than current levels by 2080. Wind speeds associated with monsoons may also increase by up to 23 per cent by 2050. "Frequency of monsoons is not expected to change much, but they may shift south of their normal location," it said.\u000a\u000aRainfall outside of monsoon season is expected to increase by between 11.5 - 23.4 per cent above current levels, averaged across India, the report said. According to it, populations of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa are vulnerable to climate change, particularly as both have high dependency on agriculture for livelihoods.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"By the 2080s, there is a projected increase of monsoon rainfall of up to 28 per cent over Madhya Pradesh and up to 23 per cent over Orissa. The projected temperature increases are 4.3C over Madhya Pradesh and 4.2C over Orissa," it said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAn increase in drought events is projected by mid-century, but with fewer droughts towards the end of the century, the report said.

VNEW DELHI: Government is planning to develop two "smart" cities with a host of modern features like intelligent transport and carbon neutral status in each of the states in the second phase of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal mission."We have an urban renewal mission which means that the central government funds the cities and one of our programmes is that we propose to have two smart cities in every state," Urban Development minister Kamal Nath told reporters here today.The minister said medium sized cities with half a million to one million population will be developed as smart cities and expertise of Austrian Institute of Technology had been sought for the purpose.Nath was speaking after meeting a delegation led by Austrian minister of Transport, Innovation and Technology Doris Bures here."Now how do we define these smart cities, what will it cover....right from broadband, intelligent transport to carbon neutral (features), these are so many components...that is what we propose to collaborate with the Austrian Institute of Technology," he said."We want to seek assistance from the Institute on what kind of model smart cities we should look at," he added.Nath also said that medium sized cities like Ujjain or Jabalpur would be considered for the proposal to create smart cities."We cannot take on very large cities for smart cities at this stage, we must recognise that. We have to take our medium sized ones, so we want to look at cities with half a million population to one million population instead of trying to take on cities with ten million population," he said."We have discussed the possibility of collaboration between the Austrian Institute of Technology and the National Institute of Urban Affairs which comes under the ministry of Urban Development," Nath said.

VThe coral cover of Australia's Great Barrier Reef , a World Heritage Site, has halved over the past 27 years due to cyclones, poisonous starfish and bleaching linked to climate change, a new study has found.Researchers at Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville have found the loss of coral was caused mainly due cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish. Coral bleaching was also to blame, the report was quoted by Australia's ABC news as saying.The study has been published in Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system.The report has warned the rate at which the reef was declining continued, its coral cover could halve again by 2022 and it may lose the biodiversity for which it was listed as a World Heritage Area in 1981.The study also argued that stopping the progress of the crown-of-thorns starfish was crucial to the recovery of the 3,000km-long reef.One of the researcher John Gunn said the future of the ecosystem could be under threat if the loss of coral is not stopped."Accumulative impacts of storms and crown-of-thorns and two bleaching events have had a quite devastating effect over the last three decades," Gunn said, adding "We're very concerned that this is a bit of a crossroads for the reef and this data is very authoritative.""I can't pretend that if we had this type of impact continuing and we had some of the possible impacts of climate change in the future that the Great Barrier Reef really is at threat," Gunn said.Gunn, chief executive of the institute in Townsville, said damage to the reef was patchy, with some areas affected more than others."There are parts of the reef that are still pretty much as we'd like the whole of the reef to be, and they give us some hope that that's what we could achieve with the whole of it," Gunn said."These are areas north of Cooktown and they're pretty healthy reefs, in fact they're beautiful. It's the areas that really have these cumulative impacts, the three factors that we take account of in the study that have really come under sort of major pressure," he said."But even there, there are reefs that are still very, very lovely to visit," he added.

VPORBANDAR, GUJARAT: Ideals of Mahatma Gandhi offer solution to overcome various universal issues including global warming Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi said on the occasion of the 143rd birth anniversary of Father of the Nation at his birth place here."If we try to understand ideals of Gandhiji, we shall find that they show path to overcome problems like global warming faced by the world," Modi said after paying tributes to the Mahatma at his birth place Kirti Mandir.It was a matter of great pride for the state that a person like Mahatma Gandhi was born in Gujarat. It was not only an individual but an era that took birth on this soil, he said.Modi appealed to the people to follow Gandhi's ideals on cleanliness and simplicity. "The nation is lagging far behind on international parameters on social hygiene and we could do a lot more on this front," he added.Modi said had the path shown by Gandhi been followed, then it would not have been required to launch 'clean Ganga' drives.He also asked the people to embrace Khadi and promote it in a big way. "If Khadi sales go up, then the proverbial lamp of joy and prosperity would be lit in lives of Daridra Narayan (poor)," Modi said.

VThe world last month matched a record for the hottest September, and some scientists point to global warming as a cause.\u000a\u000aIt was the third time since 2000 that the world set or tied a heat record for September. Previous hot September records were set in 2003 and 2005. The records go back to 1880.\u000a\u000aLast month\u2019s average temperature was 15.6 Celsius worldwide, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Monday.\u000a\u000aWhy September? It might be the lengthening of the Northern Hemisphere summer as a result of man-made global warming and the loss of Arctic sea ice that indirectly helps cool other parts of the world, said the University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver.\u000a\u000aThis is the 16th time that the world has set or tied a hot temperature record since 2000, according to NOAA. The last time the world set a cold temperature record was in December 1916, nearly 96 years ago.\u000a\u000aThese trends are manmade global warming at work, Weaver said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s playing out is precisely what climate said we should expect to see 20 to 30 years ago,\u201d Weaver said.\u000a\u000aThis is the 331st consecutive month with global temperatures above the 20th century average.\u000a\u000aFor most of the year, world temperatures were warmer than normal, but not near record levels. At the same time, the United States kept setting heat records. But while September was a record hot month for the world, the United States ranked as only the 23rd hottest.\u000a\u000aNOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt said the heat was most intense in South America, Japan, Russia, Canada and the Atlantic Ocean.\u000a\u000aTwo weather factors may be in play, Weaver and Arndt said.\u000a\u000aThe La Nina weather oscillation \u2014 which is the flip side of El Nino and tends to depress global temperatures slightly \u2014 ended. And the Arctic was unusually warm and had a record amount of sea ice melting, factors that alter weather throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\u000a\u000aSome sceptics of global warming have been pointing to British data that a London newspaper claims shows no warming since 1997. But the United Kingdom meteorological office and Weaver said the claims are misleading.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know what data they are looking at,\u201d Weaver said. .\u000a\u000a\u201c2010 is the warmest year. 2005 is the second warmest year.\u201d According to NOAA, all of the top 10 warmest years on record have occurred after 1997, when sceptics claimed global warming stopped.

VHYDERABAD: A day after PM Manmohan Singh kick-started the 'Hyderabad Pledge' by announcing $50 million for biodiversity conservation, the developed countries remained reluctant to commit money under the Convention on Biodiversity at the ongoing meeting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnvironment and forests minister Jayanthi Natarajan continued parleys with key countries in order to get everyone on common ground by Thursday night at the meeting that has more than 180 country representatives in attendance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFriction between the countries continued with African nations like Namibia taking the lead in demanding that the rich countries come true on the promises made in 2010 that they would pledge funds to save global biodiversity in 2012 at Hyderabad.The developed countries have instead demanded that firm 'baselines' be first developed, indicating how much funds are already deployed and how much more is required. While countries like India and China do not expect to receive money from the rich nations, smaller economies were miffed that the issue of a 'robust baseline' was being used to defer commitments made earlier.Holding a media briefing on Wednesday, Natarajan said she felt confident that all contentious issues would be resolved by Thursday night, providing ample time on the final day \u2013 Friday \u2013 for countries to formally adopt the decisions as well as make political pledges on financial commitments. But she avoided pinning any interim financial target under the Hyderabad Pledge that might be met or committed at this meeting by other countries.There were late night parleys on other issues besides funding. Whether subjects being dealt with by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change should be considered under the biodiversity convention and to what extent remained unresolved. The developing countries apprehend that the rich nations would attempt to slip in elements to their advantage on issues like deforestation and geo-engineering under the CBD when they have been blocked at the UN climate convention.Under the UN convention on climate change, a regime of growing and protecting forests for sequestering carbon has been formalized. The developed countries have argued that the impact of doing so on biodiversity should be monitored under the biodiversity convention which the developing countries have opposed.

VThe trail of destruction left behind by \u2018super-storm Sandy,\u2019 one of the largest storms ever to hit the east coast of the United States, underscores our immense vulnerability to Nature\u2019s Fury.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAfter killing around 70 people in the Caribbean, Sandy gathered speed to lash the US east coast on Monday-Tuesday. Its ferocious winds blew off the roofs of houses, uprooted trees and toppled electrical power lines. It whipped up the seas to dangerously high levels causing severe flooding in New York City, plunging it in darkness. Wall Street, which closed for a day in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, was forced by Sandy to shut down for two days and the US\u2019 oldest nuclear power plant, Oyster Creek, was put on alert. Life has ground to a halt across the east coast. The super-storm has killed around 16 people, an estimated 50 million people are affected, with over a million forced to evacuate. Damages have been pegged at over US$ 20 billion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy itself, Sandy cannot be attributed to climate change. However, it fits into a pattern of extreme weather events evident across the world that is attributable to climate change. The US experienced abnormally high summer temperatures this year, record drought conditions in its corn belt and now an unusually strong hurricane. Extreme summer temperatures affected around 1 per cent of the earth\u2019s surface some decades ago; now they affect over 10 per cent of its land area. Climate change scientists warn that as ocean temperatures rise, the intensity of Atlantic Ocean hurricanes will increase. This will compel coastal towns to raise the height of sea walls. But Sandy has sent out a message that this alone is not enough. We need to go to the root, which is curbing carbon emissions and addressing climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSandy has underscored that even the world\u2019s largest economy and military power is defenceless before extreme weather conditions. Ignoring climate change is therefore not an option any longer. Climate change was conspicuously missing on the election campaign agendas of both the candidates in the US presidential election. Both candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, will rush to draw mileage out of the hurricane by reaching out to those affected by it. However, it is the statesman among them who will come out with a robust plan to deal with climate change.

VUpdated: Tue, Oct 30 2012. 10 06 PM IST\u000a\u000aParis: The hammer blow dealt to New York by superstorm Sandy should raise the alarm for coastal megacities in Asia which are more exposed but less equipped to deal with such threats, experts said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aNew York was able to draw on top-level civil engineering, good governance and the world\u2019s richest economy as it faced a once-in-a-century event.\u000a\u000aBut that is not the case for many cities that have risen, often anarchically, on a coastal arc from China to the Arabian Sea, luring millions in search of a better life.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese cities are undergoing very rapid expansion and they are not only exposed to sea-level rise, they are also exposed to tropical cyclones,\u201d said Bob Ward, director of policy at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment in London.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is clear there isn\u2019t any urban planning going on, and they have a lot of poor people living in very low-quality housing who are going to be especially vulnerable and exposed.\u201d\u000a\u000aA 2007 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study identified 20 port cities which, in terms of population, would be most exposed to coastal flooding by 2070.\u000a\u000aFifteen were Asian, with the first eight places headed by Kolkata followed by Mumbai, Dhaka, Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Bangkok and Yangon.\u000a\u000aThe other Asian cities were Haiphong (10th), Tianjin (12th), Khulna in Bangladesh (13th), Ningbo in China (14th), Chittagong (18th), Tokyo (19th) and Jakarta (20th).\u000a\u000aThe remaining five were Miami (9th), Alexandria in Egypt (11th), Lagos (15th), Abidjan in Ivory Coast (16th) and New York, which rated a distant 17th.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe cities with the highest protection are European countries, places like Holland have got really high (flood) defence standards, whereas some of the American cities, their defences are not that high,\u201d said Susan Hanson, an expert in coastal engineering at Britain\u2019s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research who co-wrote the report.\u000a\u000aSeveral factors combine to make the new megacities so vulnerable, she said.\u000a\u000aOne is a rise in mean sea levels, which according to the study\u2019s model will be around 50 centimetres (20 inches) by 2070 as warmer temperatures cause oceans to expand.\u000a\u000aThen there is the thrust, or wind-whipped storm surge, from cyclones, which also dump vast amounts of rain.\u000a\u000aSome scientists say these storms could become more vicious and frequent with time, but others disagree.\u000a\u000aTom Mitchell, head of climate change at Britain\u2019s Overseas Development Institute, said, \u201cThere is some evidence to suggest that with climate change we might see stronger windspeeds but that the overall number of tropical cyclones will show no change or maybe even go down a little bit.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe impacts of superstorms are hugely amplified when cities strip away their natural defences and people are allowed to settle in places of risk.\u000a\u000aIn a report last March on extreme weather, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted that a 50cm (20-inch) rise in sea level would make much of Mumbai uninhabitable.\u000a\u000aAccording to the OECD report, 1.9 million people in Mumbai were exposed to coastal flooding in 2005, a figure likely to rise to 14 million in 2070.\u000a\u000aAwareness of the risks and good governance are key to diminishing the threat, said Ashvin Dayal, head of the Rockefeller Foundation in Asia, which supports a project to strengthen the region\u2019s climate defences.\u000a\u000aCities can respect flood plains and rebuild mangroves that are a natural shield against storm surge. They can improve planning to prevent dangerous sprawl and use better modelling to see how land is used.\u000a\u000aAnd they can promote simple but effective techniques such as cementing the floors of a house, which means water can drain out after a flood with no damage to the building\u2019s structure.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to move from a situation of looking for fail-safe solutions to a situation where you can also have safe failure,\u201d said Dayal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThings like this (Sandy) do jolt people and do make people sit up and take notice. We must just make sure they don\u2019t have short memories.\u201d AFP

VTill June 2012, as many as 2,355 CDM projects of Indian companies (projects that are eligible for tradable certified emission reduction credits under the \u2018clean development mechanism\u2019) were approved. Yet, only 860 of them got registered.\u000a\u000aA recent study of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), which did a survey on why only a third of the approved projects got registered, found out that too much of procedure and financing issues were key hurdles.\u000a\u000aThe poor registration of the approved CDM projects signifies \u201cthe slow pace of acceptance at the international registration level and therefore dampens sentiment of the project developers.\u201d\u000a\u000a(Under the CDM mechanism as defined under Article 12 of the Kyoto protocol, projects that result in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below a specified benchmark level, are eligible for \u2018certified emission reduction\u2019 credits\u2014one credit per tonne of carbon-dioxide not emitted. These credits can be traded. These instruments will be bought by companies that are unable to bring down emissions from their own plants. By doing this, the companies effectively pay for and enable emission reductions elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThe CDM regime was to come to an end in 2012. FICCI\u2019s study assumes significance because of the fact that recently the parties to the Kyoto protocol have agreed there will be a second commitment period under the Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2017 or 31 December 2020. As a mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM will continue through that second commitment period.)\u000a\u000aClerically-oriented\u000a\u000aFICCI says that the entire CDM process is too clerically-oriented with excessive focus on documentation, completeness checks and other irrelevant parameters. The process over-emphasizes the need for near perfect documentation instead of the overall objective of climate change mitigation.\u000a\u000aMoreover, transaction costs of CDM are significantly high. There is a need to make the process simpler and economical, says FICCI.\u000a\u000aOne of the financial barriers requires the project developers to show that proposed project activity is less attractive (financially) without CDM. The designated bodies that validate and monitor emission reductions always require the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to be around 9%-11% to pass this barrier, ie., any project with IRR above this is taken to be attractive even without CDM.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an anomaly because financial institutions do not accept projects with IRR below 16%. This problem of contradictions mainly arises because financial institutions of every country have criteria and requirement which differs from that of the UNFCCC,\u201d says FICCI.\u000a\u000aIt feels that if at all a financial barrier has to be there, it should be made country specific because interest rates and inflation are country specific.\u000a\u000aramesh.m@thehindu.co.in

And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be -- given this week's devastation -- should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action," he said.\u000a\u000a"But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House -- and over the past four years, President Barack has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks," he added.\u000a\u000aObama in a statement said he is honoured to have Bloomberg's endorsement.\u000a\u000a"I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days," he said.\u000a\u000aSoon thereafter, Obama also bagged the endorsement of the Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who noted that President's "significant leadership" on the economy and world affairs are reasons for his decisions.\u000a\u000a"The President always had my vote. What I wanted from the President was an ability to work closely with the Republican Congress to be able to get things done," Schwartz told CNBC in an interview.\u000a\u000a"I think he has shown significant leadership, the kind of stewardship of the economy in the country and world affairs that he deserves to be re-elected," Schwartz added.

VThe vast destruction wreaked by the superstorm-driven flood surge in New York City this week could have been prevented with a sea barrier of the type that protects major cities in Europe, some scientists and engineers say. The multibillion-dollar price tag of such a project has been a hindrance, but it may appear more of an option now.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe time has come. The city is finally going to have to face this,\u201d said oceanography professor Malcolm J. Bowman at Long Island\u2019s Stony Brook University. He has warned for years of the potential for a catastrophic storm surge in New York and has advocated for a barrier.\u000a\u000aGovernment responses have been mixed after the superstorm.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot build a big barrier reef off the shore to stop the waves from coming in,\u201d Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday. But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo opened the door to new ideas on Tuesday, saying that the government has a responsibility to think about new designs and techniques to protect the city in the face of what look like increasingly frequent megastorms. \u201cPart of learning from this is the recognition that climate change is a reality. Extreme weather is a reality. It is a reality that we are vulnerable,\u201d Cuomo told a news conference on Wednesday\u000a\u000aInvented by Bowman and his colleague Douglas Hill, two European engineering firms have drawn up proposals for walling most of New York City off from the sea, at a price just above $6 billion.\u000a\u000aBefore the storm, Bloomberg\u2019s administration had said it was working to analyse natural risks and the effectiveness of various coast-protection techniques, including storm-surge barriers. But officials had noted that barriers were only one of many ideas, and they have often emphasised more modest, immediate steps the city has taken.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a series of small interventions that cumulatively, over time, will take us to a more natural system\u201d to deal with climate change and rising sea levels, Carter H. Strickland, the city\u2019s environmental commissioner, told The New York Times this summer. Engineers know this approach as \u201cresilience\u201d essentially, toughening the city piece by piece to make it soak up a surge without major damage. But the European engineering firms whose barriers protect the Netherlands and the Russian metropolis of St. Petersburg see this as unrealistic, given the vast amount of expensive infrastructure that underpins New York.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow does New York as a city retreat into resilient mode? It\u2019s just difficult to see how that would happen,\u201d said Graeme Forsyth, an engineer for CH2M Hill in Glasgow, Scotland.\u000a\u000aSandy sent a record storm surge 14 feet (4.3 metres) high into New York Harbour, flooding subway tunnels and airports. It forced the closure of the stock market for two days, the first time that\u2019s happened for weather-related reasons since 1888. There\u2019s no estimate yet for the cost of the devastation in New York City, but forecasting firm IHS Global Insight put the cost of the damage along the coast at $20 billion, plus $10 billion to $30 billion in lost business.\u000a\u000aForsyth has worked on St. Petersburg\u2019s barrier, which consists of 16 miles (25.7 km) of levees and gates shielding the city, built on what was once a swamp, from the Baltic Sea and the river Neva. The centrepiece of his firm\u2019s early-stage proposal for New York is a levee-like barrier that would stretch five miles (eight km) across the mouth of the harbour. The barrier would stop a surge of 30 feet (9.1 m), twice the height from Sandy. Gaps would allow ships, river water and tides through, but movable gates could close off all of New York Bay from the Atlantic when necessary. The barrier would protect most of the city and shield parts of neighbouring New Jersey, which was hit hard by this week\u2019s storm.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, some scientists have reservations about the storm-surge barrier concept.\u000a\u000aSome are concerned about how the structures could affect tidal flow and other environmental features of New York Harbour and about whether barriers would be socially fair.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho gets included to be behind the gate, and who doesn\u2019t get included? ... How do you make that decision in a fair way?\u201d Robert Swanson, an oceanographer who is Bowman\u2019s colleague at Stony Brook, said in an August interview.\u000a\u000aOther experts question whether barriers would even work in the long term. Klaus H. Jacob, a Columbia University climate-risk researcher who has advised New York City officials, has noted that given the unknowns of climate change, any system designed now could prove inadequate in the future.\u000a\u000aBut advocates believe that America\u2019s largest city needs to take bigger steps given its concentration of people and financial infrastructure.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith the kind of protection that has been considered so far, you cannot protect a multimillion-inhabitant city that runs part of the world economy,\u201d said Piet Dircke, who has worked on the extensive system of sea barriers in the Netherlands with the Dutch engineering firm Arcadis.\u000a\u000aRobert Trentlyon, a New York community activist who has been advocating for storm-surge barriers, sees the one-two punch of Hurricane Irene in 2011 which came close to flooding subway stations in southern Manhattan and Sandy as a sign that the time has come.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaving had two storm surges within one year, and their both being major ones, I just find it very difficult to think the city could not go ahead and act,\u201d the retired local newspaper publisher said by phone Sunday from his Manhattan apartment, which was left without power. His neighbourhood, though not his building, was among those that flooded.\u000a\u000aIn August, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler urged city officials to take a comprehensive look at storm-surge barriers, bulkheads and other flood-fighting devices.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aA large component -- about 50 per cent -- of sea-level rise over the past half a century has been driven by the warming of oceans which are absorbing at least 30 per cent of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere, according to leading oceanographer Susan Wijfells.\u000a\u000aThe other major factor for sea-level rise, the melting of ice caps and giant ice sheets, was also increasing over the past few decades, she added.\u000a\u000aDeployment of Argo floats\u000a\u000aDr. Wijfells, who is the co-chair of International Argo Steering Team (IAST), told The Hindu here on Thursday that a network of 3,000 Argo floats had been deployed across different oceans by 28 nations, including India, to study heat and mass movement in the oceans. Each of these floats delivers in real time the profile of temperature and salinity up to a depth of two km from the ocean surface.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe key thing is it allows us to follow where the ocean is storing heat and where it is salty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was important as it sets the speed at which the climate could change, she added.\u000a\u000aStorms in winter\u000a\u000aWith the 13-year-old Argo project achieving a milestone this month in completing its one millionth profile, Dr. Wijfells said \u201cso far we have learnt many new things.\u201d She said by locking up \u201catmospheric carbon\u201d the oceans were slowing down green house gas formation. Now it was known where a lot of surface water was getting pushed inside an ocean. A combination of winds, ocean currents, eddies and surface water saturated with gases was responsible for pushing it down.\u000a\u000aEarlier, it was not known what the ocean looked like in winter time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a lot of exchange between the atmosphere and oceans because of storms in winter,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe data generated so far showed that saline areas were becoming more salty and fresh water places were getting increasingly fresher. It was a fingerprint showing that the water cycle was becoming more intense. This was very important for the future. As we continue to warm, the contrast between wet and dry areas would continue to increase indicating that people living in drought areas could expect more droughts.\u000a\u000aAccording to M. Ravichandran, a member of IAST and scientist at Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Sciences, short spells of high intensity rainfall were increasing in India and those of low intensity were declining, although there was not much change in the total rainfall.\u000a\u000aDr. Wijfells was in the city to attend the international Argo data meeting.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aKoyambedu market, the city\u2019s retail hub for fruits, vegetables and flowers, has now been declared a green complex.\u000a\u000aThis is part of an initiative towards marking the city\u2019s commitment to challenging global warming and climate change. Authorities also hope it will help counter allegations of the decrease in tree cover in the city because of the metro rail construction \u2014 most of the market complex\u2019s land has been handed over to Chennai Metro Rail Ltd., for construction work in the area.\u000a\u000aThe decision was taken by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and on Thursday, housing and urban development minister R. Vaithilingam, in the presence of Mayor Saidai S. Duraisamy, commenced work on planting 1,000 trees on the market premises.\u000a\u000aApart from tree cover and flowering bushes, the complex will feature an aesthetically-designed landscape with a Rs. 2.5 crore new compound wall, rainwater harvesting structures and solar lighting.\u000a\u000aAt present, several civic projects are underway in the market complex, including augmentation and maintenance of the infrastructure, worth Rs. 33.63 crore. Most of this work, that includes the creation of new stormwater drains over 9 km long, widening of roads and concretisation of a 350-metre road connecting gate 7 and 14, which is used by heavy vehicles to carry perishables to the market complex, has been completed.\u000a\u000aWork amounting to about Rs. 4 crore is still underway, including the storwater drain network. The funds for the project were collected under infrastructure and amenities charges from builders.\u000a\u000aOnce this is completed, work on making the complex more environment-friendly will gather momentum. However, the preparation of estimates for most of the green work is underway.\u000a\u000aSenior officials of the housing and urban development department also inspected the work on Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe Koyambedu market complex was planned in an area of around 295 acres and the wholesale market for perishables has been developed in an area of around 60 acres under the first phase. It has 3,194 shops for vegetables, fruits and flowers.\u000a\u000aThe market has two blocks for vegetable shops and one each for the fruit and flower markets.\u000a\u000aA CMDA official said work on making the complex green will have a major impact on the city, as the market borders the Chennai Moffusil Bus Terminus where thousands congregate every day, and construction of the metro rail is also on in the area.

VWith massive steel Sidra trees sprouting from the base of the building and a nine meter high sculpture of a spider in the lobby protecting a sack of grey and white eggs, Qatar National Convention Center is hard to ignore. But it\u2019s what most visitors don\u2019t see that may become the building\u2019s lasting legacy in a region far better known for over-the-top excesses than conservation.\u000a\u000aFrom the sustainably logged wood used in its construction to the 3,500 sq. m of solar panels on the roof, the building designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki is considered one of the most environmentally sound convention centres in the world.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want to change people\u2019s mindsets,\u201d said Ali al Khalifa, CEO, Astad Project Management, which oversaw the construction, as he led a visitor through an exhibition hall where dozens of ceiling windows helped cut down on electricity. It will take centre-stage in November when it hosts the U.N. Climate Change Conference, the first to be held by a top oil producing country.\u000a\u000aGreen buildings would seem an oddity in this tiny Gulf nation which has plenty of oil and gas and, according to the International Energy Agency, the highest per capita emissions in the world, closely followed by Gulf neighbours Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. But attitudes about energy use are changing across the Gulf. There is a growing recognition that the once seemingly limitless fossil fuels will some day run out.\u000a\u000aBuildings are a logical place to start. They consume up to 70 per cent of energy in parts of the Gulf compared to 40 per cent worldwide due to the preponderance of glass skyscrapers and brutally hot conditions. These nations have come late to the green building movement, lagging far behind the US, Europe and Asia in building structures that emit fewer emissions and consume less water.\u000a\u000aNow, the Persian Gulf countries are leading with the number of buildings that are under construction and trying to earn LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certificates. There are 1,348 LEED-registered buildings in the region, which surpasses all but Asia and the US.\u000a\u000aOne step further\u000a\u000aDubai in the UAE is home to one of the region\u2019s first green shopping malls and is building an eco-friendly mosque in 2013. On the outskirts of capital Abu Dhabi, the government-run Masdar Institute has built the first phase of a pre-planned city that aims to be powered by renewable sources including solar.\u000a\u000aQatar and Saudi Arabia appear to have even bigger ambitions. In Doha, work started in 2010 on Msheireb Downtown Doha, which promises to be the world\u2019s largest sustainable community with 100 buildings using an average of a third less energy.\u000a\u000aIn Saudi Arabia, authorities have applied for LEED certification for the King Abdullah Financial District in Riyadh, which will be home to the country\u2019s stock exchange. The nation\u2019s first LEED-certified project, the 26-building campus of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, opened in 2009 and recycles all its wastewater, uses 27 per cent less energy than a typical campus and was built with 20 per cent recycled content.\u000a\u000aMost of these green buildings rely on 21st century solutions to reduce their footprint: high-tech operating systems that ration electricity and power, additional insulation, thicker glass to reduce external heat, and designs that orient the structure to limit sun exposure. But, as the university campus shows, the region is also tapping technologies that are centuries old to solve its energy problems. There are wind towers and lattice-like shading on windows known as mashrabiya and a tent-inspired roof system that blocks the sun and extends throughout the campus. \u201cWhen we start a project, we research what people built in this location before they had electricity. How did they keep buildings warm or cool?\u201d said Bill Odell, Sr V-P, HOK Architects, who designed the campus. \u201cAll these ideas we took out of traditional Islamic architecture.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe future looks fresh\u000a\u000aThe challenge now, experts say, is to go beyond a handful of high-profile projects and apply green building practices to the bulk of Gulf construction, including low-rise office towers and residential projects. To do that, governments have to make green building codes compulsory and provide greater incentives to developers.\u000a\u000aThe other hurdle is sourcing building materials locally, which can cut down on emissions from transportation of material like steel, cement and wood. Today, almost everything is imported.\u000a\u000aThose were among the challenges Qatar faced when it set out to design the exposition centre that finally met LEED\u2019s Gold certification. It went as far as Belgium and South Korea to get environmentally-certified wood, steel and glass. This increased the initial cost and contributed to additional carbon emissions from shipping but in the end helped ensure the building produces 32 per cent less energy than a comparable convention centre.

VUpdated: Fri, Nov 30 2012. 11 37 PM IST\u000a\u000aDoha: India and Brazil accused rich nations on Thursday of doing too little to fight climate change at UN talks in Doha and denied that emerging economies were backsliding from pledges to step up action from 2020.\u000a\u000aThe US and the European Union, the top rich emitters, have both said they will not increase planned cuts in emissions by 2020 as part of wider efforts to shift from fossil fuels towards renewable energies.\u000a\u000aIn turn, rich nations want more action by the fast-growing emerging nations\u2014India is the number three greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the US, while Brazil ranks about 17th.\u000a\u000aWorld emissions of carbon dioxide rose about 3% last year, largely because of strong growth in emerging economies despite slowdown in many rich nations.\u000a\u000aAs each faction presses its case, the talks are floundering in their efforts to step up ways to slow a rise in rise temperatures that the UN panel of climate scientists says will bring more floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aMira Mehrishi \u201cWe are disappointed... that the developed countries are in the process of locking in low ambitions\u201d for slowing climate change,, head of India\u2019s delegation in Doha, told a news conference at the 27 November-7 December talks among 200 nations.\u000a\u000aAndre Correa do Lago Reuters. \u201cMany developed countries are not...concentrating on their main problem, which in general is energy,\u201d Brazil\u2019s delegation leadertold\u000a\u000aMehrishi denied that the group of major emerging economies\u2014China, India, Brazil and South Africa\u2014were backsliding from promises a year ago to work for a new global deal meant to be agreed in 2015 and enter into force from 2020.\u000a\u000aDivisions\u000a\u000aEven so, in the past year, they have emphasised that the planned accord preserves a divide between developed and developing nations defined in a 1992 climate treaty that obliges rich nations to lead.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not that (major emerging) countries are sliding backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a package that will be applicable to all.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, the 1992 divide defines nations such as South Korea, Singapore or Mexico as developing even though they are richer than some European states that are bound to make cuts.\u000a\u000aCorrea do Lago noted that Brazil was reining in its main problem as deforestation of the Amazon fell this year to the lowest since monitoring started in 1988. Trees soak up carbon dioxide they grow and release it when they rot or burn.\u000a\u000aAnd Mehrishi said that India was committed to its 2009 pledge to reduce the amount of carbon emitted per rupee of economic output by 20-25% by 2020 from 2005 levels. That lets emissions rise, but less fast than economic growth.\u000a\u000aDoha is trying to extend the existing Kyoto Protocol, which obliges almost 40 rich nations to cut emissions by an average of at least 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000aBut Russia, Canada and Japan say they are pulling out of Kyoto, leaving only a core group led by the European Union and Australia. The US never joined the 1997 Kyoto pact.\u000a\u000aThe head of the UN panel of climate scientists said that evidence that global warming is man-made was getting stronger, a blow to sceptics\u2019 hopes that rising temperatures can be explained by natural variations.

VDOHA: Even before the ministers of more than 190 countries arrived at the Qatar capital on Monday, the UN climate negotiations are set to lock the countries in to a low ambition deal with little to offer on emission cuts or money for the next eight years. Worse still, the chess board of negotiations has been set to also create a low-ambition global compact for the post-2020 world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Doha round of climate talks had begun with expectation on three fronts, that the world would commit to higher level emissions reduction between now and 2020 and that the developed world would start upscaling and delivering funds to the poor world to ensure it reaches the targeted US $100 billion by 2020. The third expectation was that the discussions on the new pact, which is to be negotiated by 2015 would take the shape of a strong architecture which forces countries to take hard decisions. The last was predicated on Kyoto Protocol thriving well beyond 2013.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut even mid-way in the week it became clear that the US, EU and other developed economies had come to Doha with nothing to offer. Both the US and EU point-blank refused to increase their emission targets any further. The US gave no reason but was rather blunt that its voluntary target of 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2005 levels (which translates in to 0-4% reduction by the standard 1990 benchmark) was all the world would see for the next eight years.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThen EU, which has always poised itself as the greenest of the lot, and built alliances with small island countries and least developed states, also announced it would not budge from its 20% reduction limit under the Kyoto Protocol, even though its already achieved 18% of it already. As a result it offered to reduce a further 2% under the global regime by 2020 when its been reducing emissions at the rate of 2.5% ever year on average much to the charging of its own allies with whom it had sold its high ambition image till recently.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe well marketed Australian offer to join the Kyoto Protocol starting 2013 was a dampener as they offered the 5% target they were supposed to be offering almost two decades ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe developing world now naturally sees no reason to do more when those with the greatest and primarily responsibility have abdicated. The rich countries over the week have also made clear that they are not willing to have a timeline and targets over the next 8 years to achieve the set US $100 billion fund for poor countries to adapt and reduce their emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf that isn\u2019t gloomy enough, EU has made sure that the Kyoto Protocol \u2013 the only legally binding regime to reduce emissions will now become a pledge-and-review regime where each country puts the targets it wants and does not really bother if it adds up to the level of action required by science. The ratification of Kyoto Protocol beyond 2013 \u2013 which would have given it the legal force - remains a distant dream.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe next week promises to be more acrimonious but the chances of a crash remain minimal with the 190 plus countries already running on the path to standstill. What could cause bigger clashes are the attempt to throw out of the talks unresolved issues of developing world\u2019s concerns such as equity, IPR and unilateral measures. That is an attempt to rewrite the terms of engagement for the next three years when the world figures out the new global compact that is to be implemented from 2020 onwards.

VDoha: Cheap, short-cut ideas to cool the planet such as shading sunlight are failing to win support from the United Nations (UN) delegates looking to improve on the slow progress made by existing technologies.\u000a\u000aMany scientists say the proposed solutions, known as geo-engineering, are little understood and might have side effects more damaging than global warming, which is projected to cause more floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.\u000a\u000aChristiana Figueres \u201cLet\u2019s first use what we know,\u201d said, head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, dismissing suggestions that it was time to try geo-engineering to halt a rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many proven technologies we know exist that are tried and true that have not been used to their maximum potential,\u201d she said. \u201cTo begin with, the simplest is energy efficiency.\u201d\u000a\u000aGeo-engineering options include adding sun-reflecting chemicals to the upper atmosphere to mimic the effect of big volcanic eruptions that mask the sun, or fertilizing the oceans to promote the growth of algae that soak up carbon from the air.\u000a\u000aAmong other ideas, a giant mirror could be placed in space to block some sunlight or sea spray could be injected into the air to create clouds whose white tops would reflect sunlight.\u000a\u000aRajendra Pachauri \u201cLet\u2019s face it, geo-engineering has a lot of unknowns,\u201d, chairman of the UN\u2019s panel of climate scientists, said on the sidelines of UN-led climate change talks among 200 nations in Doha from 26 November to 7 December.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can you go into an area where you don\u2019t know anything?\u201d he said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is examining geo-engineering in depth for the first time as part of a major report due in 2013 and 2014.\u000a\u000aStill, one study by US scientists in August indicated that planes or airships could carry a million tonnes a year of sun-dimming sulphate materials high into the atmosphere for an affordable price tag of below $5 billion.\u000a\u000aCheaper\u000a\u000aThat would be far cheaper than policies to cut world greenhouse gas emissions, estimated to cost between $200 billion and $2 trillion a year by 2030, they wrote in the journal Environmental Research Letters.\u000a\u000aMira Mehrishi \u201cIf you are looking at solutions you could look at solar energy,\u201d said, head of India\u2019s delegation in Doha. \u201cIt\u2019s a little premature to start looking at geo-engineering.\u201d\u000a\u000aArtur Runge-Metzger \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of scepticism\u201d about geo-engineering, saidof the European Commission. \u201cResearch is necessary to see if it could be viable in one way or other.\u201d\u000a\u000aUN negotiations on slowing global warming have been running since a UN Climate Convention was agreed in 1992.\u000a\u000aOne problem is that adding sulphates\u2014a form of pollution\u2014to the air would not slow an acidification of the oceans since concentrations of greenhouse gases led by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would keep building up.\u000a\u000aSome carbon dioxide, absorbed into the oceans, reacts to form carbonic acid. That erodes the ability of creatures from clams or mussels to lobsters and crabs to build their protective shells. In turn, that could disrupt marine food chains.\u000a\u000aJean-Pascal van Ypersele \u201cYou might temporarily delay the warming but you are certainly not going to help the oceans at all,\u201d said, a vice-chair of the IPCC, of using sulphates. \u201cOcean acidification is a real emerging issue.\u201d\u000a\u000aA mask of pollution might help some crops by reducing heat stress but it might have other side-effects, for instance, by disrupting monsoon patterns. That could bring disputes between countries that benefited and others that suffered.\u000a\u000aAnd Van Ypersele said that, if geo-engineering went wrong and needed to be shut down after a few years, there would be a big, damaging jump in temperatures.

VThe talks, which were initiated with the promise of coming up with a new regime to stall the spiraling effect of climate change, failed to deliver on the promises so far. Even as the talks enter the sixth day, the Indian industry and the government are keeping their hopes low for a favourable outcome.\u000a\u000aDuring the week, India\u2019s chief negotiator had told reporters \u201cWe are disappointed that the developed countries are in the process of locking in low ambitions under this second commitment period. We call on them to raise their level of ambition consistent with what is required by science.\u201d\u000a\u000astarted on a bad note: The US said it would not raise its weak level of commitments to cut emissions. Australia put out its Kyoto Protocol target, under which it says it would reduce emissions by 0.5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. During the week, the said they would not step up the pledge to cut emission. It has agreed to 20 per cent carbon emission cuts from 1990 levels for the period of 2013 to 2020, a target which has already been achieved.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNO DIRTY COOLING\u000a\u000aAs global leaders continue to debate in on the extent of fund to be allotted to developing countries for mitigating adverse impacts of climate change, Indian firms are taking proactive measures to reduce carbon emission as well as emission of certain HFCs or Hydro fluorocarbons, which are potent contributors to global warming. HFCs are currently used in refrigeration, air conditioning, insulating foams, etc. Its production and use are projected to grow by more than double between now and 2050, with the vast majority of the growth occurring in China and India. In India alone, 300 mn air conditioning units will be in service by 2030, as per the data by the Indian Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Manufacturers\u2019 Association. The power consumed by air conditioning will also rise by over 100-fold by 2030. COOLING WITHOUT WARMING\u000a\u000aSome domestic firms as well as global firms operating in India are switching to alternative cooling systems, using natural coolants or moving to green buildings that doesn't require artificial cooling. Here's how some firms are using alternative cooling systems. Green freeze Godrej: In 2012, Godrej & Boyce, inaugurated new production line for the manufacturing AC. The new line is estimated to consume 23% less energy than the current top-of-the line 5-star models across brands.\u000a\u000aPanasonic: Panasonic claims it\u2019s using Eco Navi technology in its ACs that senses the absence of people in a room and cools select areas, translating into reduced energy consumption by nearly 30%. Green buildings\u000a\u000aSwabhumi Hotel Complex, Kolkata uses innovative building design that stimulates the way trees trap winds to deliver cooling services.\u000a\u000aNIIT University, Neemrana, Rajasthan, uses earth-air tunnels which act as self-regulating heat sink, to maintain the ambient temperature. Green vending Coca Cola: On December 2009, the soft drinks major announced that, globally, 100% of their new vending machines and coolers will be HFC-free by 2015. Till April 2012, the firm has replaced 600,000 units using natural refrigerants worldwide.\u000a\u000aPepsiCo: Till April 2012, PepsiCo has over 147,000 HFC-free units (coolers & vending machines) worldwide.\u000a\u000aThe assurance by climate negotiators from developed countries such as the US, Germany and the UK that their governments will continue to pay out aid aimed at helping the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries cope with global warming failed to resonate well with the developing countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cFinancing a key piece of the puzzle as the transition to low carbon economies will cost. But as yet, promises have been made but never delivered. Instead fast-track financing \u2014 promised by developed countries to pay for mitigation and adaptation costs \u2014 has not been additional or new. Instead, it is repackaged from existing aid,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director general of Center for Science and Environment.\u000a\u000aEven Indian industry bodies had been demanding clear roadmap on climate financing for a long time.

VSUNDARBANS: (West Bengal): The ongoing extension of the electric grid to the remote islands of Sundarbans will not only adversely affect the viability of existing renewable energy projects, but will also accelerate the process of climate change , experts say."In view of the growing threat of climate change and contribution of the electricity sector to the overall green house gas emission, there is need for adopting appropriate strategies to rationalise use of coal and fossil fuel in the electricity sector," according to a latest report by research body CUTS International India's fossil fuel-driven energy sector is one of the biggest contributors (more than 50%) to carbon emission , widely considered to be chiefly responsible for climate change worldwide.In West Bengal, 96% of electricity is generated through use of coal, officials say.Under the Remote Village Electrification scheme by the Union ministry of new and renewable energy, it is mandated to develop off-grid projects using renewable energy sources for remote villages in India.However, with the demand for electricity expected to grow 10 to 20 fold between 2010 and 2020, the West Bengal government is extending grid-based electricity to about 1,076 villages in the Sundarbans.Environmentalists warn that the soil in the wetlands of Sundarbans is soft and setting up of large and heavy transmission poles may increase erosion and even change the tidal patterns when installed in rivers and creeks, surrounding the fragile islands.

VNEW DELHI: The government plans to ask state power utilities to sell surplus land or carbon credits to raise funds and be eligible for the Rs 1.9 lakh crore debt restructuring package, in which state governments will take over half the short-term debts of distribution companies.The proposal will be another shot in the arm for power firms. Already, states have raised power tariffs and the government is working out a price-pooling mechanism for domestic and imported coal to address fuel scarcity in the sector.A senior power ministry official said sale of land and carbon credits may be required for some distribution companies as banks are not willing to provide loans to fund cash losses of distribution firms.Other conditions that can be explored are asking the distribution companies to source electricity at competitive rates through tariff-based bidding and reviewing performance of power generating and transmission assets in consultation with NTPC NHPC and Power Grid Corp to make them commercially viable, he said."While there are mandatory conditions such as improving operational performance, regular tariff hikes and reducing distribution losses, there would also be recommendatory conditions to be laid by us in discussion with lenders to improve functional efficiency of discoms and shore up their revenues," the power ministry official said.

VThe recently concluded Doha conference lacked the anticipation and media focus of Copenhagen (2009) and the last minute climax as witnessed last year in Durban. One may have thought that the conference will deserve more seriousness than the outcome that it produced; it was preceded by the super storm Sandy and the relentless typhoons in the Philippines, which many climate scientists believe is the result of anthropogenic GHG emissions leading to higher global mean temperatures.\u000a\u000aThe spate of inclement weather patterns becoming pronounced over the last few years may have put pressure on the negotiators to proactively look for a comprehensive global deal. Given the fact that all countries had pledged to achieve the goal of limiting the mean temperature rise to 2 degrees Centigrade in 2050 by massive reduction of GHG emissions, the recent rush of extreme weather patterns had created the potential for Doha to diverge from the pattern set by the conferences in Poznan, Mexico and Durban. That, however, did not happen.\u000a\u000aThe long-term goals need to be incrementally calibrated from now till 2050. This is precisely what has eluded the negotiators; firm commitments by developed countries for reducing GHG emissions and providing adequate and predictable finance for adaptation and mitigation actions in developing countries are yet to become a reality. Affirmative action by developed world is at the heart of global climate regime and follows the principle of \u2018polluters pay\u2019, enshrined as Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR).\u000a\u000aCBDR, in recognition of the fact that the present problem is the outcome of GHG emissions by developed countries over the last many decades, requires them to not only reduce them but also provide finance to developing countries to follow a low GHG emission pathway to economic development. Kyoto Protocol (KP) enunciates this principle and mandates developed countries to legally binding GHG emissions reductions.\u000a\u000aAs hazy as ever\u000a\u000aThe Doha agreement to extend KP is good news, but the fact that a handful of developed countries, accounting for 15 per cent of global GHG emissions signed up, has taken the sheen out of it. Canada, Japan and New Zealand walked out of the KP while the US never ratified it.\u000a\u000aIt is intriguing to note that with all good intentions, a plethora of meetings (there is a meeting every quarter since the last 4-5 years) and billions of dollars spent, the road to a universal treaty is as hazy as it was some years ago. The recent surge of weather anomalies and grim warnings by scientists that time is running out for limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Centigrade too has been unable to seal the deal. The presence of more than 100 heads of states in Copenhagen too was not enough. There seems to be something gravely amiss preventing the desirable outcome.\u000a\u000aThe reason given by the US, the second largest GHG emitter, for not ratifying the KP is that it feels any deal that leaves out major economies, in particular China, India, Brazil, South Africa, is not workable and will not lead to the desired goal. Thus, in the opinion of the US, KP, following the principle of CBDR, prevents developing countries from taking binding emission reductions (and now shared by other developed countries), and needs to be dumped in favour of a more inclusive global agreement.\u000a\u000aIt refers to the exclusion of China as the largest GHG emitter and India closely following as weaknesses of the present dispensation in dealing with the issue.\u000a\u000aEconomic leakage\u000a\u000aWithout taking sides, if one looks at the issue dispassionately, it will become obvious that the fear of developed countries is that of economic leakage, if the present arrangement is implemented. This argument gets implicit in various articulations, including the one about growing GHG emissions of the major developing bloc. The fact that the present regime requires developed world only to take GHG emission reduction could entail economic leakage.\u000a\u000aGHG emission reduction in developed countries where the choice of technologies has already been made will necessarily entail lifestyle changes. Simply put, the countries will have to reduce their energy consumption (which is very high in comparison with developing countries) and governments will need to take necessary measures. One obvious way is the levy of carbon tax making energy consumption expensive and forcing consumption of low-energy-using alternatives. Thus, higher tax on petrol to achieve GHG emission targets could see demand swing against SUVs while at the same time major developing countries, not required to impose such tax, would continue to witness the growing demand for high-energy consuming equipment.\u000a\u000aMaking energy expensive in the US or Europe, in addition to demand shifts, could make domestic industry uncompetitive \u2014 and may well force many some to shift their base elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThe obvious candidates are the major developing countries (China, India, Brazil, etc.) where there are no cost additionalities. The long-term scenario, which is consistent with the global aspirational goal of 2050, could potentially transform the economic map of the world and therefore the balance of power.\u000a\u000aTrust deficit\u000a\u000aThe demand to revisit CBDR, efforts to breach the firewall between developed and developing countries enshrined in KP by referring to major economies as distinct from other developing countries, including climate change issues in WTO and other international fora, are manifestations of the looming threat of economic leakages that, in the opinion of the developed world, the present climate change regime could perpetuate. This deficit of trust is one of the most important bottlenecks to arriving at a global agreement.\u000a\u000aThere could, however, be a way to bridge this trust deficit. It may also provide a pathway that is bereft of the present competing political and economic compulsions. The International Energy Agency has repeatedly pointed out that almost 60 per cent of GHG emissions could be avoided by energy efficiency interventions globally. Further, as projected by McKinsey in its analysis for India, significant energy efficiency gains are actually negative cost opportunities (see table) \u2014 the low hanging fruit in all economies that are yet untapped.\u000a\u000aThese actions are mostly related to enhancing energy efficiency, such as replacement of incandescent bulbs by CFLs/ LEDs, promoting high efficiency ACs/refrigerators and other energy using equipment, hybrid cars, etc, ensure recovery of additional investments in a short period of time.\u000a\u000aThen, there are those positive interventions which require substantial investments, such as solar thermal energy, coal gasification. A concerted global effort with seed capital to kickstart the process could lead to unlocking of the potential. A global roadmap to promote large-scale energy efficiency interventions could not only enhance the energy security of nations but would also initiate affirmative action in GHG emission reductions.\u000a\u000aMcKinsey (see table) estimates that the investments would pay back in a couple of years. Serious engagement of the global community on energy efficiency could become the first important step to the elusive climate deal as it would help bridge the trust deficit.\u000a\u000a(The author is Programme Officer, OzonAction Programme, UNEP, Bangkok.)

VA combination of innovative technology, efficient pricing and patented solutions has helped catapult a class room project on clean technology into a startup venture that is garnering global attention.Carbon Clean Solutions (CCS), founded by two graduates from the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur, has built technology that has the potential to cut the cost of capturing carbon dioxide by more than half, an application that can be widely used by coal-fired power plants.Aniruddha Sharma, 26, and Prateek Bumb, 27, who first worked on this as a college project, have now been awarded a grant of Rs 33 crore by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department of Energy and Climate Change.The Mumbai-based firm, which was chosen as a winner in a global carbon capture and storage innovation competition, will use the grant for larger-scale demonstration of the technology at power plants.\u201cThis technology will be a step -change in the way emissions are managed and mitigated globally,\u201d says Dr Martin Haemmig, a Stanford University researcher and lecturer and a mentor to CCS.The firm is not only helping power plants and large scale emitters to combat climate change, but it is also enabling them to sell captured carbon as a raw material for making marketable chemicals, fire extinguishers, dry ice and fizzy drinks.The biggest market for captured carbon dioxide is by injecting it into oil wells and natural gas fields to enhance recovery.Lot of attention is moving towards innovative startups like CCS, as energy companies are abandoning expensive projects to remove carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants.\u201cIt costs less than $30 to capture each ton of carbon dioxide using our innovation, compared with about $60 for traditional solvents,\u201d says Aniruddha Sharma, chief executive of CCS.CCS is betting big to tap the global carbon capture and storage market worth $27 billion and expected to grow to $ 229 billion in two decades, according to the International Energy Agency.In India it is a $2-billion opportunity and expected to grow to $ 30 billion in the same time period. Carbon capture was a classroom project for Aniruddha Sharma and Prateek Bumb, when they were studying at IIT- Kharagpur in 2008.Initially they presented the idea at various business plan competitions organised by IITs across India and won many of them. The two friends were invited to a clean technology forum in San Francisco in US where they met Dr.Martin Haemmig from Stanford University who was impressed by their idea and became their mentor and investor.Haemmig who was also a senior advisor on venture capital to Stanford University, connected Sharma and Bumb to executives from various industries like power, oil and gas to identify the gaps in the carbon capture and storage market.

VThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy wants to make procurement of electricity from renewable sources also through competitive bidding process, just as in the case of conventional power. The Ministry has come up with \u201cguidelines and standard bidding documents for tariff-based competitive bidding process for grid connected renewable energy power projects\u201d and has recommended them to the Ministry of Power for notification.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnless explicitly specified in these guidelines, the provisions of these guidelines shall be binding on the procurer,\u201d it says, defining \u2018procurer\u2019 to mean electricity distribution companies. Any deviation from the guidelines would have to be got approved by the respective state electricity regulatory commission. Since the procurement of power from solar sources is already under competitive bidding, the major implication of these guidelines is on the wind industry, which has opposed these guidelines.\u000a\u000aThe Indian wind industry is already in trouble. Two major incentives \u2014 generation-based incentive and accelerated depreciation \u2014 have been withdrawn from the beginning of the year. In the windiest state of the country, Tamil Nadu, the industry is further suffering from non-settlement of dues by the state\u2019s distribution company, TANGEDCO, and non availability of the grid during windy periods. As a result, the wind power addition in 2012-13 is likely to be about half of last year\u2019s 3,170 MW.\u000a\u000aThe Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association has sent a petition to MNRE seeking removal of the applicability of the guidelines to the wind industry, Secretary of the Association D.V. Giri told Business Line. \u201cThis is not the time to bring in competitive bidding for the wind industry,\u201d Giri said.\u000a\u000aThe Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association, whose members own about 3,000 MW of wind power capacity, has also opposed the guidelines. \u201cWind is infirm and there is no certainty of supply. As such, wind power tariff cannot be determined on competitive bidding basis,\u201d Dr K .Venkatachalam, Advisor to the association, said.\u000a\u000aramesh.m@thehindu.co.in

VThe is planning a scheme to control emissions from industrial plants and other air polluters, using a market-based mechanism.\u000a\u000aThe move comes on the heels of India\u2019s assurance to voluntarily take mitigation action to reduce carbon emissions by 2020.\u000a\u000aThe ministry is mulling the idea of introducing an emissions trading scheme (ETS) as a pilot project in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Both states have critically polluted areas, with many large industries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will hold a meeting with Gujarat and Tamil Nadu in the third week of January and an action plan will be prepared. Based on this, it will be implemented,\u201d a ministry source said.\u000a\u000aA discussion paper on such a scheme was presented by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, at the request of minister Jairam Ramesh in August last year.\u000a\u000aIn an ETS, industrial plants and other polluters, rather than being told to stick to a fixed emission limit, face a price for their emissions and choose how much to emit, within reasonable limits, taking this price into account.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe price of emissions makes pollution costly and gives polluters an intensive to cut back,\u201d it says. The paper says such schemes have great potential to lower pollution, while minimising costs for industries. Units are able to choose for themselves the cheapest way to reduce pollution. In comparison, traditional command and control regulations do not allow for differences across industries.\u000a\u000aOn the regulatory side, an ETS, once established, will provide a self-regulating system that makes pollution control more efficient.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the longer run, the reduced costs of compliance can also make it easier to introduce new regulations that increase environmental quality,\u201d the paper said.\u000a\u000aThe ministry opted for Tamil Nadu to introduce the scheme as the state is experimenting on a similar innovation, the real-time online monitoring of pollution loads at the industrial unit level.\u000a\u000aThe state has already started a programme for generating real-time air quality information reports in some of their large industrial clusters.\u000a\u000aRamesh has said availability of accurate real-time data of the type being generated in Tamil Nadu also allows for possibility of implementing market-based instruments such as an ETS.\u000a\u000a\u201cAn ETS for air pollution would have the benefit of enabling lower pollution levels, at lower overall costs of compliance. It would allow the regulator to set a cap on the aggregate level of pollution permitted, and then allow a self-regulating system to ensure that pollution does not exceed this cap,\u201d the minister had said.

VEven as some major environment polluting countries have chosen to put on hold their plans for introducing domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading, India seems set to go ahead with it, disregarding the imperfections in a market-based emission reduction mechanism. No doubt, some well-conceived initiatives and incentives are badly needed to encourage polluting industries to cut down harmful emissions. But, a government-run may not yield sufficient gains. The scheme mooted for this purpose by the Union environment ministry, to be tried out initially on a pilot basis in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, envisages setting ceiling on permissible emissions of and issuing permits to them in accordance with their pollution quota. The industries which do not limit their pollution level can offset their default by buying permits from others. This essentially means that cash-rich polluting units can continue to pollute and yet claim compliance with pollution control requirements. Few countries outside Europe have gone in for domestic emission trading. Even Japan, one of the world\u2019s largest polluters which had planned to introduce such trading, has now developed cold feet. The US, which has launched several kinds of market-based pollution control schemes, has also shown caution on domestic trading of all GHG emissions. It has chosen to limit such trading to only the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen that are believed to cause acid rain. The European Union has an elaborate internal in place and is prodding other countries to also go in for it.\u000a\u000aThe genesis of market-based approaches for pollution control is traceable to the international carbon trading introduced under the (CDM) of the But even CDM has not sufficiently impacted the overall global GHG emission levels. Of course, carbon trading has led to transfer of some resources from the rich and polluting nations to the poor but low emitters. But, this has happened without the much-needed transfer of pollution mitigation technologies. Little wonder then that the recent on climate change failed to end uncertainty over the future of carbon trading-based CDM. To be successful, any domestic emission trading instrument will require technologically sound and an absolutely transparent system to fix pollution caps and the amount of emission permits to be allotted to each polluting unit. Besides, the actual pollution levels of each unit will need to be monitored regularly to work out their tradable emissions. Any error by the regulators in estimation of emission permits or actual emissions can distort the emission market apart from unfairly benefiting or penalising different industrial units.\u000a\u000aThe existing pollution control boards, in their present avatars, do not seem capable of undertaking this arduous task. This would require either creation of new institutions or revamping and strengthening of existing ones. Moreover, ways and means would have to be found to minimise, if not wholly plug, the scope for malpractices, corruption and harassment. Clearly, more thinking is needed before a domestic is put in place.

VPANAJI: The rise in pollution, temperature and sea level may have complex and harmful spin offs for benthic organisms, which support the bottom feeding varieties of fish, stated NIO scientist Baban Ingole Around 36 climate champions from 19 countries under a British Council flagship programme visited Anjuna beach, considered a bio-diversity hotspot by NIO scientists with its sandy and rocky outcrop. Ingole explained the impact of climate change on the micro and meio organisms."Some species adapting to changes may survive while others may disappear," Ingole explained on Monday. Some opportunistic ones like jelly may flourish in the absence of competition from other species.The increased pollution, especially toxic metals may have a long term effect even at the higher consumer level, including human beings. "The fish will consume the contaminated benthic organisms and in turn, human being may eat them, resulting in rise in diseases related to metal toxicity," he added. The climate champions who are attending a seven-day camp in Goa were told about the intertidal life, including plants and animals, and effects of pollution on various aspects of beach ecology.Ingrid Lomelde, Norway said the field visits offered her an opportunity to learn how climate change affects the eco system in Goa. "The field visits were very interesting," she said, adding that this was her first trip to the state.On Sunday, the delegates who visited Mhadei research centre in Chorla ghat near Anjunem dam were given a demonstration about equipment used in data collection of reptiles and amphibians in western ghats by herpetologist Nirmal Kulkarni. "They were also briefed about the various flagship species of the region including the Malabar pit viper, the King cobra and the Goa caecilian," Kulkarni said.Later, they attended the inauguration of an exhibition on 60 cartoons related to climate at Science centre, Miramar after visits to NIO and Goa University . Katie Hall, from the UK said, "The cartoons were really insightful."

VNAGPUR: State agriculture minister Radha Krishna Vikhe-Patil has announced that a new insurance scheme would be formulated to cover the crop losses suffered by farmers in the state. "We are initiating discussions with all stakeholders to design an entirely new scheme as the one available now is hardly attracting any beneficiaries," Vikhe Patil said here on Monday.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of inaugural of an international symposium on `Water and agriculture' and 45{+t}{+h} annual convention of Indian Society of Agriculture Engineers, he said the government was engaging progressive and award winning farmers of the state and other stakeholders to get an insight into their requirements so that the new insurance scheme had larger acceptability."Recently, the government announced a Rs 1,000 crore relief package for farmers who suffered crop loss because of excessive rains and orange growers whose trees dried up in excessive summer heat. But even before the relief amount was distributed, a section of farmers in Vidarbha are now reporting big losses from frost and cold wave conditions. Whatever sum is given as relief is often inadequate and does not meet farmers' expectations while cash-strapped government incurs huge burden," said Vikhe-Patil"So, as a better alternative, we are formulating an insurance plan that will realistically meet the farmers crop losses. The government may be able to fund the scheme by paying the premium dues to the tune of Rs 700 to Rs 800 crore," said the minister. At the same time, he said orders had been issued for fresh joint survey by the revenue and agriculture department staff to assess damage to crop from frost and severe cold wave that prevailed in Vidarbha early this month. To bring a scientific basis to crop damage assessment, data collection from all 2100 revenue circles would be done through automatic machines that would be linked to satellites, he said.Climate change, paradigm shift in weather conditions were among the reasons for unsustainable agriculture in the region. Acknowledging media reports of high suicide rate among farmers for the tenth consecutive year, he said the PM's package, loan waiver and other relief measures had reduced distress levels to certain extent, but the government intended to do more for families and dependants of farmers who have ended their life in desperation. "Besides the compensation amount of Rs 1 lakh, the government may consider providing to the family additional support in form of free seeds, fertilizers etc," said Vikhe Patil.

VNEW DELHI: The Government of India has signed a loan agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for 208 million dollars for Tranche 3 of this Investment programme titled 'Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program'.This facility is for a series of loans to provide funding for four run-of-river hydropower projects totaling 856 MW in Himachal Pradesh, for an amount of 800 million dollars from ADB.This particular loan provides partial funding for stages II & III of the Integrated Kashang Hydroelectric Project totaling 195 MW located in District Kinnaur, and for the 100 MW Sainj Hydroelectric Project located in District Kullu.Himachal Pradesh has abundant water resources, with five major rivers flowing from the western Himalayas. Its power generation potential is about 23,000 MW - about one fourth of India's total hydropower potential - out of which about 6,480 MW has been developed. Recognizing the state's comparative advantage, the state government in 2006 approved a hydropower policy that aims to make Himachal Pradesh the "hydropower state" of India.Venu Rajamony, Joint Secretary (MI), Department of Economic Affairs , Ministry of Finance, signed the loan on behalf of the Government of India (GOI).Rajamony said on the occasion, "We appreciate ADB's support to this project. This is part of GOI's priority to supply clean renewable energy power projects. We look forward to successful completion of the project. The Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation, the Implementing Agency for this project is also taking the lead in development and accreditation of its project for availing carbon credits as part of the Clean Development mechanism under the UNFPCC. We also look forward to development and realization of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) benefits by the project authorities.""Himachal Pradesh's focus on hydropower development is vital to meet all in-state demand by providing affordable, reliable power to its residents as the state currently meets only about 50 per cent of its power demand through its own power generating capacity. Harnessing this hydropower will also enable the export of excess power to the rest of the country for the benefit of power deficient states. Himachal Pradesh's focus on clean energy development will provide jobs to state residents and will further the country's goal of meeting its energy needs through treading a low carbon path," said Mr. Andrew Jeffries, a Senior Energy Specialist at ADB's South Asia Department.The Executing Agency for the loan program is the Multi-purpose Projects and Power Department of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd. is the Implementing Agency. These two projects are expected to be completed by 2016.

VHow has climate change affected India\u2019s staple crops, such as rice and wheat?The impact is quite profound and measurable. For instance , a small increase in temperature reduces the maturity period of wheat and affects the crop yield drastically . According to a report by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, a one degree Celsius rise in mean temperature translates into wheat yield losses of around 6 million tonnes per year in India. At current prices, this works out to roughly $ 1.5 billion. The cumulative loss of income for farmers is much more \u2014 almost $ 20 billion, if we take into account other crops as well.Are other countries affected on a similar scale?Climate change has a differentiated impact. The changes are felt much more by countries that have low coping capacity , which means that developing countries are the worst hit. Climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Bali Plan of Action in 2007 have taken into account common and differentiated responsibilities. This is with the aim of meeting the special needs of developing countries. For example , in the future, Andaman and Nicobar, as well as Sunderbans in West Bengal, Kuttanad in Kerala and many locations along the coast face the prospect of submergence. Floods may become more serious and frequent in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Drought-induced food and water scarcity will become more acute. In contrast, countries in the northern latitudes will benefit due to longer growing seasons and higher yields.This means that climate change may actually be beneficial for some?Yes, but the scope is limited. Countries like Canada may benefit because increase in temperature will allow them to grow more crops. But, areas in India \u2014 like UP, Punjab and Haryana, which are the granaries of the country \u2014 will suffer. That is why we urgently need to plan for compensatory production of crops in accordance with changing climate patterns. China, for instance, has already built strong defences against the adverse impact of climate change. Last year, it produced over 500 million tonnes of food grains in a cultivated area similar to that of India. It helps that Chinese farm land is mostly irrigated, unlike us, where 60% of the area still remains rain-fed .Doesn\u2019t it reflect skewed planning that we haven\u2019t been able to put in place a comprehensive irrigation system and still remain dependent on seasonal rainfall?Yes, it\u2019s high time we did a re-think of our agricultural strategy \u2014 more so to account for factors like rising temperature , precipitation and climatic disasters like tsunami . Today, farming is the riskiest profession in the country . If there is a hailstorm in Punjab, it wipes away the entire wheat crop. Farming is in distress and that\u2019s why farmers are in distress and there are suicides happening.Is there an action plan farmers can follow?I firmly believe that people at the grassroots should know how to manage and check-mate climatic aberrations. We haven\u2019t utilized our panchayati raj system effectively. At least one woman and one male member of every panchayat should be trained to become Climate Risk Managers . A biogas plant and a farm pond in every farm is essential to reduce emission and ensure energy and water security . In addition, we need to classify our crops into those which are climate resilient and those which are climate sensitive . For example, wheat is a climate sensitive crop, while rice shows a wide range of adaptation in terms of growing conditions . A search for new genes conferring climate resilience is an urgent need. For a long term solution, we have to build gene banks for a warming India.

VNEW DELHI: An experiment by Indian agriculture scientists points to the enormous effect global warming could have on the fragrant basmati rice . Basmati, Sanskrit for the fragrant one, may lose not just its aroma, the famous long grains may get shorter, say scientists.H Pathak, principal investigator of Indian Agricultural Research Institute's Climate Change Challenge Programme, told TOI the Tarawari basmati grown in research fields in Delhi did not grow long enough and wasn't as fragrant as it should have been when cooked.He said global warming may be to blame for the disappointing basmati produced in the 2006-2007 experiment. Temperatures that year crossed 26 degree Celsius in September when the basmati flowers and, 15 to 20 days later, when the grain begins to fill out, because of which a shrivelling of the grain was seen.The extra heat, he said, prevented the food stored by the plant from travelling to the grain. Consequently, it failed to grow to the right length. The heat also destroyed fatty acids stored in the grain which give the basmati its distinct fragrance when cooked.No field studies have been done so far but if true, global warming may have enormous implications for India's prized basmati crop, which stood at 4.5 million tonnes last year.Pathak says the IARI has been receiving complaints from farmers about a sudden warming damaging rice crops. But Dalel Singh, who heads Haryana Agricultural University's Rice Research Station at Kaul, says his scientists have not observed the phenomenon seen at IARI, at least in harvests from 2007.Pathak says temperatures in the 700 acres that make up the IARI campus in the heart of Delhi are similar to those in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh which grow Tarawari basmati. Therefore, what the scientists saw at IARI will be replicated in these areas.Pathak says the best solution would be to bring planting dates forward, so that high temperatures in September don't affect the crop. The other solution would be to develop a new, heat-resistant basmati variety, though they generally have smaller yields.

VThe unseasonal rain that has begun to fall on Karnataka every January and February hasn\u2019t affected coffee production very much \u2014 there\u2019s just a 5% dip in yield. But, it\u2019s entirely possible there will be discernible change in the quality of the coffee bean... and the coffee that you drink.Blame global warming ? There\u2019s more.Assam, which accounts for more than half (52 per cent) of all the tea India produces , last year grew 15 million kg less than the year before. Some of the tea reportedly tasted different \u2014 much weaker than the \u201cstrong\u201d brew that Assam is famous for.And then there is Himachal Pradesh\u2019s main crop \u2014 the apple. The fruit grows on 90,000 hectares across the state but Himachal could lose as much as 25 per cent of that, as low-lying orchards at anywhere between 4,000 and 5,500 ft start to warm up.A CHANGE OF TASTEAcross India \u2014 from east to west, south to north \u2014 the effects of climate change are seen to be slowly becoming apparent. Karnataka coffee, Assamese tea and Himachal apples are just three on a lengthening list of crops that are affected by changing climate patterns. Maharashtra\u2019s grapes, Goa\u2019s mangoes and cashew nuts, Kerala's paddy crops and Haryana\u2019s wheat \u2014 are seen to be affected too.It\u2019s part of a change that is sweeping the globe, which the United Nations \u2019 Food and Agricultural Organization took note of in September. At the time, the agency's assistant director general, Hafez Ghanem, predicted a turbulent long-term outlook for food prices across the world because of more frequent extreme weather due to climate change.So what, if anything, is India doing about some of its key crops?RAINING TROUBLEDown south, the Coffee Board of India has begun a special insurance scheme to help farmers cope but it admits it might find it hard to cushion them against the impact of sharply falling exports. Karnataka coffee is sent to Italy, Russia, France, Germany and the UK and Jayarama, the Coffee Board\u2019s director of research , says these markets may be put off by the declining quality of the coffee.This, because coffee is acutely sensitive to rainfall and badly needs the blossom shower in the flowering season \u2014 mid-March \u2014 and the backing shower \u2014 roughly three weeks after that. This is crucial to bean development. Jayarama says the problem is the additional showers in January and February, which cause \u201cthe coffee crop to fruit twice or maybe three times.\u201d The beans that come later, he adds, are inferior.If Karnataka\u2019s coffee-growers have it bad, so do the Nashik Valley\u2019s grape farmers. They\u2019ve had to start tweaking cultivation cycles \u2014 the fruit is grown across 1,80,000 hectares in Maharashtra \u2014 because of changing weather patterns.Mahendra Sahir, president of the Maharashtra State Grape Growers Association, says the state has received rain in November for the last three to four years. It\u2019s forced farmers to delay pruning and \u201cif pruning is delayed, everything that comes afterwards is also delayed,\u201d says Sahir. He acknowledges that times are increasingly hard and \u201csometimes we find it difficult to meet our deadline for the supply of grapes to the port, from where the fruit is sent on to European Union (EU) countries.\u201dCLIMATE CHAOSUp in the northeast of India meanwhile, scientists are gloomily predicting the region will become wetter. So what is going on? The only thing scientists seem able to agree on is that there is no agreement on climate change affecting crop patterns.Dr H Pathak, principal investigator of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute\u2019s Climate Change Challenge Programme, says the definite change in rainfall patterns could lead to our worst-case scenario. \u201cGlobal warming doesn\u2019t only mean a rise in average temperatures. It\u2019s a little more complicated than that. There is for example also a rise in CO2 and a change in rainfall patterns, which could affect India very severely because much of our agriculture is still rainfed . Without rain, it will be impossible to grow many crops.\u201dBut B P Yadav, director of the Indian Meteorological Department, points out that picture is not clear cut at all. The number of days of light rainfall has decreased, but the number of days of heavy rainfall has increased, he points out. Taken together, the total quantum of rainfall has remained unchanged.ON THE BOILThere is a genuine sense of helplessness about it all. At December's annual general meeting of the Tea Association of India, its president D P Maheshwari announced: \u201cThe incessant rain, followed by a severe attacks of pests \u2014 mainly helopeltis, the tea bug mosquito which feeds on the tea leaf \u2014 caused a huge loss of crop in 2010.\u201dThe Tea Association president estimates that some tea gardens suffered crop losses of as much as 20 to 30% on the previous year's output. Soon after the disappointing yields came in, local planters started to report that the taste of Assam tea had also changed. The implications are frightening. Assam tea earns 50% of India's Rs 9,000 crore income from tea sales and a change in its signature taste could mean a rapid drop in demand.Cue sunny Goa, down in the west of India.Last year, it rained for 10 months, only letting up in February and March. Goa\u2019s two major crops \u2014 mango and cashew \u2014 were badly hit. Again, the implications are horrendous . Goa produces 40 metric tonnes of mangoes and 24 metric tonnes of cashews. A local farmer complains of enormous \u201cconcern about the extension of the rainy season and temperature fluctuations during the season.\u201dPESKY PESTSThe changing rainfall pattern also threatens Kerala\u2019s paddy crop. The sowing season runs from October to December but in Kuttanad, which is justly called the state\u2019s rice bowl, the incessant rain meant sowing could only begin in December. A changed cultivation cycle means pests attack the crop at a different stage of growth. It\u2019s meant that insects like the rice thrips, earlier thought of as minor pests, are destroying vast swathes of the crop in Kuttanad.S Leenakumari of the Rice Research Station in Mankombu in Alappuzha district, admits the situation is dire. \u201cThis could trigger a panic, forcing farmers to take to insecticides, which in turn will also kill the pest\u2019s naturally-occurring enemies. That will finally lead to insecticide dependence in the long run,\u201d he says.Kerala\u2019s rice farmers are in a bind. Delay the sowing season and the flowering season gets pushed back, probably to the summer. But if daytime temperatures cross 35 degrees, there is a severe danger the heat will shrivel the grains and production will fall.This has already been noticed in Palakkad \u2014 the state\u2019s other major paddy-growing area where daytime temperatures can cross 45 degrees in summer.STAPLE STORYIndia\u2019s other staple grain \u2014 wheat \u2014 is also affected. Dr Pathak of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute\u2019s Climate Change Challenge Programme, says that \u201csince 2002, a phenomenon called \u2018terminal heat\u2019 , caused by global warming, has been observed in the months of February and March.\u201dThat\u2019s a crucial period for a wheat crop because that's when it begins to mature. A sudden rise in temperature causes the grain to shrivel and production to fall.Up in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh, meanwhile, the battle is on to save the primacy of its apple crop. Apples need at least 900 to 1,100 hours at temperatures below seven degrees celsius if they are to ripen properly. But experts say if the state warms up too much the apples will grow faster and be a lot less tasty. S P Bharadwaj of the Dr Y S Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry in Nauni says rising temperatures will not just lower the fruit\u2019s shelf life, it will make them less juicy and a lot less crunchy.Experts say Himachal\u2019s apple growers need to change with the times \u2014 and the climate \u2014 growing different varieties, including those better suited to warmer temperatures and using techniques like drip irrigation.But it may not be so easy for everyone to change with the times \u2014 and the climate.Reports by Jayashree Nandi in Bengaluru, Naresh Mitra in Guwahati, Nikhil Deshmukh in Pune, Paul Fernandes in Goa, Vijay Sabharwal in Kurukshetra , Ananthakrishnan G in Thiruvananthapuram and Jagdish Bhatt in Shimla

VPUNE: Climate scientists on Monday stressed the need for protecting the ozone layer by reducing emission, to lessen the impact of climate change on the earth. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are globally recognised as the main causes of the depletion of the ozone layer . The Montreal Protocol has successfully reduced the global production, consumption and emissions of ODSs," the experts opined at a seminar here. They recommended a ban on products which lead to generation of ODSs and CFCs. Alternative products should be promoted, they added.National and international scientists participated in the technical seminar on 'Tropical stratosphere-troposphere: Implications on Indian monsoon and climate', as part of a workshop on 'Stratospheric processes and their role in climate', hosted by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology here. University of Pune vice-chancellor R K Shevgaonkar inaugurated the seminar.The workshop will focus on all aspects of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, including stratospheric variability and climate change, processes of stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling, the polar stratosphere, annular modes and seasonal weather prediction, impact of stratospheric aerosols (volcanic eruption-induced) on monsoon, impact of ozone depletion/recovery on southern hemisphere climate, etc.'Stratospheric processes and their role in climate' is a core research project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). It was launched in 1992. The principal objective of the project is to help the stratospheric research community focus on significant issues related to climate and to gain a better understanding of the effects of the stratosphere on climate.

VSINGAPORE: India's cosmopolitan cities like Mumbai Kolkata and Bengaluru have been ranked "below average", while Delhi is a "average" performer in ' Asian Green City Index ' that termed Singapore as the "greenest city" in the continent.According to the study, Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi was the worst performer, being alone in the list of cities "well below average."In the index of 22 cities, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru find themselves with Manila, capital of the Philippines, and Vietnamese capital Hanoi.The research commissioned a few months back by German engineering major Siemens and Economist Intelligence Unit categorises, Asian cities with respect to the environmental performance in eight categories: energy and CO2, land use and buildings, transport, waste, water, sanitation, air quality and environmental governance.It said "well above average" Singapore City "stands out in particular for its ambitious environmental targets and its efficient approach to achieving them."The Indian capital is among "above average" performers in Energy management and curbing CO2 emissions, but Kolkata disappoints with a below average tag. Each inhabitant in Delhi generates, on average, an estimated 1.1 tonnes of CO2 per year, the third best level in the Index, and well below the Index average of 4.6 tonnes.The report lauded Delhi and said it "has proactive policies to limit greenhouse gases. It also scores particularly well for its climate change action plan."Even Mumbai had better reading with its inhabitants emitting an estimated 1 tonne of CO2 per capita per year, which is much lower than the Index average.Giving example of Delhi's environmental governance, the report said "City's environmental department is using school 'eco-clubs' to try to shape student's views: Students can engage in a vast range of activities, including air monitoring, water harvesting, eco-tours, and awareness-raising campaigns...Convenient way to spread information widely on environmental campaigns."Kolkata is one of the better performers on the water front with consumption of 138 litres per person per day. This is one of the best rates among the 22 cities, and better than the average of 278 litres.Mumbai is also competing with Kolkata on water front. The report said the western metropolis has "fairly efficient water system," losing just 14 per cent of its water flow through leaks versus the Index average of 22 per cent.This is one of the best rate among cities. The study lauds the recent official efforts to reduce water leakages, which once ran as high as 50 per cent. Mumbai is also comparatively sparing in its water use, consuming on average 250 litres per capita per day."Other Asian cities as well, environmental awareness and climate protection guidelines are playing an increasingly important role," the company said in a statement.Delhi stands in average category along with Shanghai, Bangkok, Beijing and other rising Asian cities Guangzhou, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Nanjing and Wuhan.Cities which performed better than the Indian Capital were Hong Kong, Taipei, Osaka, Tokyo, Seoul and Yokohama.

VLUCKNOW: The rate at which the glaciers are receding in the country is not alarming. "The general notion that glaciers are receding due to global warming is not right. While working on various glaciers, we have found that local conditions, climatic changes at the location make a big difference in the recession of glaciers,'' said deputy director general, Geological Survey of India (GSI), Sumant Singh , while talking to TOI.According to him, the notion that all glaciers are retreating is also not correct. "There are some glaciers that are in the advancement stage, and those receding also are not doing so at a rapid rate,'' said Gupta. He was speaking during a meet on `Late Quaternary Geology of the Himalayan Orogen and the Foreland Basin', held in the geology department of Lucknow University.Other geologists, participating in the event, expressed their concern on the anthropogenically-induced global warming on the glaciers.Rameshwar Bali, faculty, department of geology, Lucknow University, who has worked on the Pindari glaciers, was of the view that the recession of glaciers is not a new concept. It has been happening for the past 150,000 years. "The glaciers have been retreating, then advancing, again retreating and the process follows. This clearly shows that the process is natural. Global warming is a reason but not the sole reason for recession of glaciers,'' said Bali.A member of the first scientific expedition to Arctic, and faculty, department of geology, LU , Dhruv Sen Singh further clarified that the retreat of glaciers has always been considered as the evidence of increase in temperature due to global warming. "If global warming is the only reason for rapid rate of retreat, then all glaciers should recede at the same rate. But glaciers are retreating and advancing at variable rates,'' said Singh.On the occasion, general manager, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (on Neotectonics and Petroleum Exploration), N K Verma shared that with the help of neotectonic studies, petroleum exploration in the mountain regions has given significant results.On the occasion, aspects concerning climate change, geological hazards, melting of glaciers, sedimentation pattern and surface processes in the Ganga plain, river floods, urban developments, and others were discussed. Use of some modern techniques such as Remote Sensing and GIS was also highlighted.Other speakers who were present included director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun; Prof A K Gupta, chairman, Central Pollution Control Board Environmental enforcement strategy in Ganga Basin; Prof S P Gautam, former director general, GSI; Ravi Shanker, HoD, department of geology, LU; among others.

The number of people using motorised transport in the country is estimated at 200-300 million.The group was formed keeping with the country's commitment to transform into a "low carbon" economy, for which it recently announced voluntary and unilateral targets to reduce the emissions intensity of the GDP by 20-25%.The implementation of targets for reducing emission intensity will be built into the strategy for the 12th Five-Year Plan, consistent with the national objectives of poverty alleviation, sustainable development and inclusive growth.The panel will review existing studies on low carbon growth/low carbon pathways prepared by various organisations and also analyse, as required, low carbon options for the economy and present a report outlining the roadmap for low carbon growth.The panel has been mandated to evaluate some key alternative low carbon options with an analysis of their cost benefits and relative merits and demerits.The panel will submit its report to the Commission in the first week of March, Parikh said, adding that the expert group will not include a cost analysis of these alternative low carbon options in its report. These would be provided later on.The Commission had mandated that the expert group will present an interim report by end-April 2010 and a final report by end-September 2010 to the

VWith several Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Ministers in the limelight for all the wrong reasons, Minister of State for Rural Development Jayant Patil is trying to make a difference in Maharashtra.\u000a\u000aDivested of the Finance portfolio, which went to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Mr. Patil has embarked on an ambitious programme of tree-planting and rural sanitation, combined with the planned development of villages for the first time.\u000a\u000aHe has visited nearly half of his scheduled 120 grama sabhas to promote the \u2018eco-village programme,' which could cost the State Rs. .450 crore. While no fresh doles were being handed out to people, they had to fulfil certain criteria to be eligible for funds under the programme, which was launched on October 2, 2010. The response has been overwhelming, going by the large turnout at the meetings, according to Mr. Patil.\u000a\u000aTo qualify under the programme, each village must achieve the target of \u201cone person, one tree,\u201d at least 60 per cent of the families must build toilets and avoid open defecation, and tax collection should be around 60 per cent. About 14,000 gram panchayats are set to qualify for the programme and funds would be allotted for further development according to the size of the population. The formula is simple \u2014 \u201cThink globally, act locally.\u201d Each person in the village must plant at least one tree. Mr. Patil's interactive speeches abound with climate change references, humourous appeals to build toilets; and the audience has been responsive. In an interview during his hectic travels, Mr. Patil told The Hindu that he had called a meeting, last February, of all the chief executive officers of the zilla parishads before a government resolution was drafted for the programme.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe decided to gear up the machinery to make saplings available in a planned way and also evolved a system of reporting from the gram panchayat-level to the deputy secretary-level. The tree-planting reports were good initially and now, in 19,000 gram panchayats (of the total 27,920), it has been highly successful,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aGram panchayats with a population of less than 1,000 would be eligible for Rs.2 lakh every year for three years. Those with a population of more than 1,000 would get Rs.3 lakh, and so on. Larger gram panchayats would be entitled to funds between Rs.15 lakh and Rs.30 lakh over three years. This money could be spent under 12 heads \u2014 including building roads, gutters, waste management or sewage treatment and disposal systems, and street lighting using solar or CFL. There was a system of verification to make sure the villages had qualified and there was a committee of zilla parishad CEOs, panchayat Samiti committees and a State-level committee headed by the Minister.\u000a\u000aThe eco-village concept has another dimension. Villages with over 5,000 people can go in for a development plan similar to that of cities, which will be valid for 20 years. The Environment Department and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) have shortlisted about 20 consultants, NGOs and organisations which would be trained in preparing a uniform template for the eco-village planning, according to Environment Secretary Valsa Nair Singh.

VNAGPUR: Amid concerns by the industry over green hurdles to development and the Economic Survey released on Friday too saying ecological concerns should not derail growth, conservationists do not expect much from Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee "The increasing importance of climate-related issues should not shake the foundations of our inclusive growth strategy," the Economic Survey said. Countering it, Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation, said, "economic development of any country depends upon conservation of natural resources like water, forests etc. Every economist knows this basic principle. But the UPA government doesn't seem to have understood it."Prafulla Bhamburkar , manager, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said tiger areas needed special attention for conservation and protection. More funds were needed to protect corridors. "Habitat management in corridors should help generate employment for locals and conserve wildlife in the long run," he said.Nitin Desai, director, Central India, Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), also wanted adequate funds to strengthen wildlife law enforcement, specially in non-protected areas (non-PAs) besides provision for secret funds for intelligence gathering. Climate change expert Nishikant Kale of Nature Conservation Society Amravati (NCSA) referred to ongoing tussle between environment and coal ministries about 'go and no go' area and said budget should focus on harnessing renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The budget should reduce tax on green equipment, he added.In the last budget, Centre had launched eight national missions as per the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), Bhamburkar said time had come for a similar mission to save tigers. The meagre allocation of funds could not save tigers, he added. Rithe said government had even enhanced the relocation package to Rs 10 lakh per family for tiger reserves but where is the money? "There are 34 villages in three tiger reserves in Vidarbha alone, what about villages in sanctuaries and national parks," Rithe said.There is minimum requirement of Rs 5,000 crore for relocation process. There are 762 villages with about 48,000 families inside core areas. The government has budgeted Rs 196 crore in current fiscal. How can you expect tigers and forests to be saved in such a situation, he asked.Last year, environment minister Jairam Ramesh had announced Rs 100 crore package for relocation of villages for Maharashtra but only Rs 18 crore have been released recently.What is expected?* Clearance to rescue centre at Nagpur, Chandrapur* Incentives to promote tree cover* Big package for relocation of villages* Grants for tigers in non-protected areas* Funds for regeneration of forests* Secret funds for intelligence gathering* Expediting eco-sensitive zones* Timely release of funds

Photo: Shiv Kumar Pushpakar\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aWith the so-called \u201cfast start finance\u201d for climate change completely missing over a year after it was promised at Copenhagen, major emerging economies have accused rich countries of trying to pass off existing funding to the wrong recipients as part of their pledges. Environment Ministers of the BASIC bloc \u2014 Brazil, South Africa, India and China \u2014 who held discussions here over the weekend, warned that this flow of money was the key to the future of climate change negotiations.\u000a\u000aAt the U.N. climate change summit at Copenhagen in December 2009, rich nations pledged to give $30 billion in \u201cfast start finance\u201d between 2010 and 2012 to help the poorest countries and those most affected by climate change. It was supposed to have been new and additional money meant specifically for small island states, African nations and the least developed countries.\u000a\u000aHowever, more than 14 months after the promises were made they are yet to be kept. \u201cI would be surprised if the total disbursement so far goes beyond two digits,\u201d said Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, in a scathing indictment of developed countries.\u000a\u000aInstead, he says, rich nations are attempting to sneak in their existing aid to large developing economies as part of the \u201cfast start finance\u201d package. \u201cThe U.S. has listed an amount of $26 million to India as part of their fast start finance pledges,\u201d said Mr. Ramesh. He added that according to Brazilian Minister Izabella Teixeira, the European Union has listed aid to Brazil as part of the same. This failure to deliver on fast start finance was \u201cthe single biggest disappointment after the grand bargain at Copenhagen,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout the flow of fast track finance, there will be problems that we don't want to face in Durban,\u201d warned Bomo Edith Edna Molewa, Environment Minister of South Africa, which will host the next U.N. summit in December 2011.\u000a\u000aIn their joint statement, BASIC Ministers made it clear that there was no point in beginning discussions on a Green Climate Fund until a sizable amount of money starts flowing under the fast start scheme.\u000a\u000aThe other critical issue on the road to Durban is the future of the Kyoto Protocol and its second commitment period. While all BASIC Ministers agreed that this would be at the centre of their negotiating agenda, the nuances of their statements here on Sunday could indicate some differing views on what exactly that future looks like.\u000a\u000aWhile Chinese representative Xie Zhenhua emphasised the \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d \u2014 which means that only rich nations have legally binding emission reduction targets \u2014 the South African Minister did not mention the Kyoto Protocol at all.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew strategy needed\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Brazilian Minister, on the other hand, said a \u201cnew political strategy\u201d was needed to ensure that the second commitment period was agreed upon, before the first expired next year. She said BASIC had come up with a proposed framework for the second commitment period, and emphasised \u201ccommitments from everybody\u201d and the need to avoid \u201cvoluntary statements\u201d alone. \u201cThe second Kyoto commitment period must reflect what science is telling us... Everybody needs to work together,\u201d she said.

VNEW DELHI: Just months after the Cancun talks, India and other BASIC nations today said that Cancun Agreements were not a "substitute" for the Bali Road Map and pledged to make efforts to bring the issues charted out in it to the mainstream of global climate change negotiations."The Bali Road Map must, therefore, continue to be the template for future work of the parties," said a joint statement issued at a conclusion of sixth BASIC ministerial meeting on climate change. BASIC is a bloc comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China."There are a number of issues in the Bali Road Map that are not present in the Cancun Agreements (of December last year)and the BASIC Group of countries will make every effort to bring these issues back into the mainstream of the global climate change negotiations," Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh told reporters after the meeting.He said the meeting has identified three particular issues-- Equity, Intellectual Property Rights and Trade."These are the three very important issues in the BASIC quartret and it will our endeavour to bring this and other Bali Road Map issues back into the mainstream of the negotiating agenda," Ramesh said.Explaining the details of negotiations, Ramesh said, "We need to continue the negotiations in 2011 leading up to Durban in a sprit of inclusiveness and transparency.""Many issues on which we need further clarity. Two most critical issues are of second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol and the issue of Fast Track Finance ," he said.Zhenhua Xie, Chinese Vice Minister of the National Development and Reform Commission and Special Representative on Climate Change, said, "We are going to safeguard the interests of developing countries to promote over all climate change negotiations' process."The BASIC group will play a very active and constructive role in promoting over all process," he said.Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Monica Vieria Teixeira said, "We will work together to support our agenda. Next two years will be very cucial for sustainable development agenda."South Africa's Environment Minister Bomo Edith Edna Molewa said, "Regarding Agreements arrived at Cancun our emphasis will be on the issues of finance, technology and capacity building etc. We have to emphasis on finance to avoid some challenges which might arise at Durban."India had invited representatives from three other countries - Argentina, Algeria and Maldives -to the Delhi meeting as these countries represent important regional groups within the "G-77 and China" bloc in the climate change negotiations.

VEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh doesn\u2019t think it should come up in the present location of a densely populated residential area. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Asian Pacific Carbon Fund has dropped it from its aid portfolio.\u000a\u000aAlso, the residents of 15 south Delhi colonies (numbering nearly 500,000 people) are dead against it. Yet, for some unfathomable reasons, the Delhi government is pushing the Rs 200-crore Timarpur-Okhla waste-to-energy project that is coming up on a 15-acre Municipal Corporation of Delhi plot, a few hundred metres from south Delhi colonies like Sukhdev Vihar, Maharani Bagh and New Friends Colony, near three premier hospitals (Holy Family, Fortis-Escorts and Apollo Indraprastha) and an old age home.\u000a\u000aIt is being built on land that was seen as a green buffer between the residential areas and a biomedical waste plant set up years ago.\u000a\u000aLike many other projects in India, this too began with a public hearing \u2014 an eyewash, really \u2014 in 2006 when the DMK\u2019s A Raja was the Union environment minister.\u000a\u000aThe Delhi government claims that it had given a newspaper notice for the public hearing (a legal requirement for projects of this size) on December 17, 2006, but no resident of the area attended the meeting. Residents, however, tell a different story. They allege that the public notice was drafted in a manner as to conceal the fact that 2,050 tonnes of municipal solid waste would be burnt everyday to generate 16 MW of electricity.\u000a\u000aLater a Right to Information (RTI) petition found that only a few people attended the hearing: an engineer from the project proponents, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, and a department clerk.\u000a\u000aAlarmingly, the Environment Impact Assessment Report of the project, which formed the basis of the clearance, has since gone missing. Today, the case is in the Delhi High Court and will come up for hearing on March 14.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, there\u2019s a Supreme Court ban on such waste-to-energy plants and the court has allowed only five pilot projects to test their viability. The one under construction in south Delhi, a private-public partnership between the Delhi government and Jindal Ecopolis, is not one of those pilot plants.\u000a\u000aYet, at the Delhi High Court, the state government touted this project as one. But replying to an RTI question, the Union ministry for renewable energy replied that it\u2019s not one of the five pilot projects okayed by the apex court.\u000a\u000aWhile the government and the company say that there are no health hazards from the project, it is well known that all municipal waste combustors, regardless of what technology they use, release a number of pollutants including cadmium, lead, dioxin, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and nitrogen dioxide.\u000a\u000aDioxin and furans are toxic and they tend to persist in the environment for generations. Studies of human populations living near incinerators and of compounds released indicate that incinerators are associated with numerous health problems, especially in children and other vulnerable populations. These health problems include nerve damage, delayed development, birth defects, brain damage, respiratory and cardiovascular ailments, and cancer.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s the issue of plastics: the residents feel that complete elimination of plastics is impossible and they would be burnt as part of fuel to attain the desirable calorific value for the project during operations. This, they feel, will directly expose the communities to highly toxic pollutants. In fact, the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000, rules say it\u2019s illegal to incinerate chlorinated plastics (like PVC) and wastes chemically treated with any chlorinated disinfectant.\u000a\u000aCleverly, the government has used the climate change shield as a cover for the project and termed it as a renewable project. But annexure A of the Kyoto Protocol says that waste incineration is a greenhouse gas-emitter!\u000a\u000aThese are some of the serious questions that need to be answered. But as things stand now, the government refuses to remove its earplugs as residents run pillar to post for a fair hearing.

VNEW DELHI: The government is considering a ban on import of equipment for projects under the National Solar Mission The move will benefit domestic solar equipment suppliers, but project developers say it could prevent the government from achieving its target of 20,000 mw of solar power generation capacity by 2022. "Over 70% of plants being set up under the first round of the mission are based on imported equipment . There is an active consideration within the government that we should either ban or further restrict import of equipment for solar projects. At least sourcing cells and modules from Indian suppliers can be looked at," an official in the ministry of new and renewable energy said.In the face of competition from foreign players, domestic solar equipment makers were able to corner only 30% of projects, totaling 704 mw, in the first round of bidding under the National Solar Mission. The next round of bidding for 296 mw of solar photovoltaic projects is likely to start in April, said Anil Agarwal, CEO of NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, the nodal agency for the first phase of the mission. "Prior to India's National Solar Mission policy announcement, other countries such as the US, Canada, France and China had already stipulated similar policies to promote indigenous development of their solar industry, thus creating a robust manufacturing base, creating jobs and attracting foreign investments and technologies," said Abhinav Kanchan, Moser Baer India head of corporate communications.Earlier, Tata BP Solar chief executive officer K Subramanya had said the move would lead to growth of domestic manufacturing. However, some feel such a move will hit solar power target achievement . A full local-content clause would slow deployment of new technologies , SunBorne Energy managing director James Abraham said. "Issues related to technologies are still to be settled. It can be done once the markets are settled," said Acme Tele director (business development and strategy - solar) Siddhartha Mathur.

VThe government has a reason to smile. The rate at which are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which had been rising sharply, has receded to 2005-06 levels. This seems to indicate the pro-environment policy agenda devised after the commitment at the Copenhagen ecology meet of reducing emission intensity by 25 per cent by 2025 has started bearing fruit.\u000a\u000aThe latest emission figures, published annually by the (CEA), reveal that power plants in India emitted 0.81 tonnes of CO2 for every MWhr (1,000 units) of electricity generated in 2009-10, similar to what was recorded five years before (see table).\u000a\u000aCO2 is a major greenhouse gas and alone contributes to 60 per cent of overall global warming. Coal-based power generation plants account for a major chunk \u2014 a little over 60 per cent \u2014 of all carbon emissions from India. The country\u2019s power plants emit 570 million tonnes (mt) of CO2 annually.\u000a\u000aIndia has proposed a 20-25 per cent cut in its emission intensity by 2025 and the government has plans to invest Rs 74,000 crore within the next five years to cut carbon emissions from its power sector.\u000a\u000aThis investment is being directed at measures to cut energy intensity of the domestic economy, including increasing the efficiency of power plants and introduction of clean coal technologies. These would result in the reduction of 98.5 mt of CO2 over the entire period, according to the findings of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency under the ministry of power.\u000a\u000aNuclear switch helped\u000a\u000a\u201cThe main reason why the energy intensity of the power sector has improved recently is the higher generation from gas-based power plants, which are showing better Plant Load Factor. Also, nuclear power generation has picked up due to better fuel availability now. These are clean sources,\u201d said Union power secretary\u000a\u000aImproved fuel availability for nuclear power plants at the back of fresh uranium imports helped push up nuclear power generation by 27 per cent to 18,653 million units (MUs) in 2009-10. Since the India-specific waiver for nuclear commerce from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers\u2019 Group (NSG) in September 2008, the country has brought in uranium from France, Russia and Kazakhstan, the three countries with whom we have import agreements, to power atomic generation.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, gas-based power generation jumped 25 per cent to 155,676 MUs in 2009-10, owing to increased availability of gas from the KG Basin.\u000a\u000aBetter data needed\u000a\u000aExperts, however, believe the government needs to finetune the data to capture emission trends from specific fuel sources to make it more reliable. \u201cThis data gives the emission profile of the entire energy mix, without focusing on individual fuel type. It also misses out on future forecasts when the power market opens up. It is possible that while the PLF of plants has improved, low coal quality led to increased emissions. But this would not be captured in the emission data of the overall energy mix,\u201d said Kuljit Singh, Partner, Ernst & Young.\u000a\u000aThe Indian economy is one of the least energy-intensive globally. The energy-GDP elasticity index for the country, a measure of the increase in energy demand required for every one per cent increase in GDP, has come down to 0.8 currently, as compared to over 1 in the early 1990s, according to the\u000a\u000aWhile India\u2019s per capita greenhouse gas emissions at 1.02 tonnes are well below the world average of 4.25 tonnes, the bulk of its power generation comes from coal-based stations. Another issue in cutting future emissions is the low efficiency of older plants. Currently, over 5,000 Mw of power capacity in India has low capacity utilisation of less than five per cent.

VIndia has become the first country in the world to incorporate Tsunami proofing for environmental clearances of major projects, after titanic Tsunami devastated key projects in Japan this month.\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh on Thursday asked the Expert Appraisal Committees, mandated to given environment clearances to projects, to include tsunami related risks in the terms of reference for Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) reports for four sectors --- nuclear power, infrastructure, thermal power and industry.\u000a\u000aThe EIA are supposed to be scientific studies on environmental viability of the projects, on whose basis the EAC takes the final call. While earthquake impact is considered in the EIAs, Tsunami is not.\u000a\u000aConsidering the large number of projects being proposed on India's 5,400 km long coastline such as refineries, oil storage depots, power plants, the ministry wants Tsunami proofing to be part of detailed project reports. And, therefore, it has been included in the EIAs.\u000a\u000aTo find out whether the existing projects in the coastal areas can withstand impact of Tsunami of intensity similar to the one that hit Japan last week and if not, what additional safeguards are required, the ministry has constituted an expert group under former bureaucrat A M Muthunayagam.\u000a\u000aThe group will submit its report to the ministry in three months.\u000a\u000aIn addition to it, the group will examine a suggestion made by Rajya Sabha member and agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan on whether to declare areas around nuclear power plants in coastal areas as Critically Vulnerable Coastal Areas.\u000a\u000aIf this is done, it would mean there would be tough restrictions on any sort of development around nuclear plants and developing bio-shields of mangroves and non-mangroves species will become a must.\u000a\u000a"There is a concern over safety of nuclear plants located in Kalpakkam and Kudangulam in Tamil Nadu makes me feel that in addition to other steps we need to promote bio-sheilds," Swaminathan, said in a letter to Ramesh.\u000a\u000aA study on impact of 2004 Tsunami on Indian coasts by V Senthil, director National Coastal Zone Management Authority had shown that the damage to wildlife and habitation in coastal areas having good mangroves cultivation was less than in mangrove deficient areas.\u000a\u000a"My studied showed that the mangroves protected Gulf of Manner, Nagapattnam and parts of Andaman and Nicobar islands from the 2004 Tsunami," he told HT.\u000a\u000aSwaminathan said the mangroves acted as a "speed-breakers" in 2004, reducing the damage caused.\u000a\u000aRamesh also said that Rs 1,200 crore has been sanctioned for conducting a hazard line mapping of coastal areas for seawater impact caused by cyclone or tsunami or climate change.\u000a\u000a"This is being done by the Survey of India and it will be completed in 24 months time," he said.

VGiven the vulnerability of to climate change, the country\u2019s food security is threatened by The Union agriculture ministry is right, therefore, to warn of a possible foodgrain deficit, of as much as 20 million tonne by the end of this decade if measures are not taken to combat the impact of on food production. It has also reportedly asked for an additional budgetary support of Rs 1,08,000 crore in the next five years for developing the required infrastructure, technology and crop varieties capable of adapting to the changed climate. This is for the first time that has quantified the adverse impact of global warning on the output of food crops, notably wheat, rice, coarse cereals and pulses, and the resources needed to avert it. With business as usual, the foodgrain output would at best be 261 million tonne by 2020, from the present 234 million tonne, where as food demand is projected to be 281 million tonne. To ensure effective food security, with supply backed by an adequate buffer stock, grain production would have to be at least 301 million tonne by 2020. This target can only be met if is able to overcome the threat posed by\u000a\u000awould particularly hit rain-fed agriculture, on which small and marginal farmers, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the total farm land, are dependent. Sustainability of food production and rural livelihoods in semi-arid tropics is, therefore, vital to food security in India. Semi-arid tropics are also areas that produce nearly 85 per cent of pulses and coarse cereals, over 75 per cent of oilseeds and about 65 per cent of cotton. Most of these commodities have contributed to high food inflation in recent years. Arid and semi-arid tracts will experience even more drought years in future as a result of global warming. A national mission on sustainable agriculture was to be one of the eight national missions mooted under the National Action Plan on Climate Change, 2008. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the research wing of the farm ministry, has already initiated programmes for evolving new technology, new crop varieties and livestock breeds capable of thriving under the emerging climatic patterns. However, they are doing it with a small budget, not commensurate with the criticality and magnitude of the task. It would be a shame if paucity of financial resources comes in the way of addressing this challenge.

VNEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday launched a black carbon research initiative to study the phenomenon of soot , its sources and impact on health and environment. Black carbon is among those non-greenhouse gas emissions that is fast becoming the focus of climate change science.Commonly known as soot, black carbon is a form of respiratory suspended particulate matter that is produced from incomplete combustion through biomass burning, cooking with solid fuels and diesel exhaust. While India and China are credited for 25-35% of global black carbon emissions, there is not much scientific information on the actual reasons or sources behind its production.\u201cWe need to be pro-active in our approach. This is an important step forward, not just for India but for the international community. India is well aware of the importance of the issue (of climate change), and is committed to addressing it, based on sound scientific assessments,\u201d said environment minister Jairam Ramesh.The black carbon research initiative will be undertaken under the aegis of Indian network of climate changeassessment. The Rs 200-crore project will be a five-year research programme, and will be a joint effort among the ministries of environment, earth sciences, science and technology and Isro. The report is meant to build on the existing aerosol study, and will involve nearly 101 institutions in research activities.\u201cThis is one of the most ambitious programmes in the world on aerosol research and black carbon. It is a culmination of over 25 years research from pioneering Indian scientists. India has positioned itself to be second to none in this area of research,\u201d said V Ramanathan, a leading scientist.

VIndia on Tuesday launched national Black Carbon Research Initiative to know whether un-burnt diesel or smoke from firewood was causing global warming and melting of Himalayan glaciers.\u000a\u000aBlack carbon or soot has been central to international climate debate as has been termed as a major source for the same. "Sixty monitoring centers in will help us in determining what black carbon does to climate," environment minister Jairam Ramesh said after launching a joint initiate of his ministry, Indian Space Research Organisation and Ministry of Earth Sciences.\u000a\u000aTerming it as a unique project, V Ramanathan said it was a great day for climate research in and would be highlight in the global scientific arena. Ramanathan works with the based Scripps Institute scientist and was the first to state that Black Carbon contributed 60 % of the total carbon dioxide induced global warming.\u000a\u000aJ Srinivasan of ISRO, who is heading the initiative, differed with Ramanathan said the existing research shows that high presence of black carbon in atmosphere is not because of local emissions. "We are monitoring black carbon at 36 locations and have found external reasons responsible for high presence of black carbon," he said.\u000a\u000aSeveral studies done in the west on black carbon had termed its high presence as a reason for faster Himalayan glacier melt. Ramesh described some of these glacial scientists as quacks and said was looking at "solid scientific foundation" on the subject.\u000a\u000a"There is complete difference in behaviour of Himalayan glaciers and arctic glaciers which need to be studied and need to establish our own scientific capacity to understand this change," he said.\u000a\u000aThe research will cost Rs 200 crore in five years and its first results are expected in two years period.

VSURAT: The city resilience strategy after a study of two years by experts has been formulated and a first draft of working document will be published on Tuesday at the plenary session of National Conference For Sustainable Cities here.With changes in global climate, its effects on population needed to be assessed and apt counter measures planned especially for cities like flood-prone Surat.Keeping this in mind, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) formed a City Advisory Committee (CAC) a few years ago. Before that Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), a Rockefeller Foundation initiative, had provided a platform and framework for a formal consultative approach towards resilience against climatic changes. The process of formulation of city resilience strategy began in 2009-10. The committee began by assessing the likely impacts of climate change on socio-economic life of the people in the city and identified future challenges. It also began identifying the strategies to address the issues.A senior SMC officer said, "This document is a pathway to future. We need to be prepared for any challenges to survive." The city resilience strategy (CRS) document highlights innovative methods like scenario exercise and GEOPSY that can function as effective urban planning tools. The impact of climate change on water, water management system, waste and sanitation systems, flood management, land use and planning, solid waste, transport, public health, social cohesion, institutional frame work and energy have been analyzed.

VWASHINGTON: Sugarcane is not only a major source for producing a biofuel alternative to gasoline, but also helps in cooling the climate if cultivated in a massive scale, according to a new study.Scientists from the Carnegie Institution\u2019s Department of Global Ecology found the important agro-industrial plants help lower the temperature of the surrounding air by reflecting sunlight back into space and \u201cexhaling\u201d cooler water.The research, published online in the journal Nature Climate Change, is the first to quantify the direct effects on the climate from sugarcane expansion in areas of existing crop and pastureland of the Cerrado region in Brazil.For their study, the researchers used data from hundreds of satellite images over 1.9 million sq km.They measured temperature , reflectivity (also called albedo), and evapotranspiration \u2014 the water loss from the soil and from plants as they exhale water vapour.Scott Loarie, who led the research , said: \u201cWe found that shifting from natural vegetation to crops or pasture results in local warming because the plants give off less beneficial water.\u201cBut sugarcane is more reflective and gives off more water \u2014 much like the natural vegetation.\u201d

VA theory of \u2018peak everything\u2019 suggests the world is running short of vital assets like clean water, carbon-free air, some minerals, fish stocks and the cheap fossil fuels that have powered the world economy and helped rein in the price of food. If countries want to secure domestic supplies and curb carbon emissions, too, then energy options are limited. And that fact has clearly dawned on governments.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTake, for example, the deadly blowout last year at BP\u2019s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, which all but stalled deep-water drilling in the United States. Licensing there has now resumed, while other countries had dismissed a deepwater freeze from the start, including Britain, whose output is dwindling in the shallower North Sea.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDependence\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe world\u2019s response to the nuclear crisis caused by the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan on March 11 is still evolving, but a bump in the road looks more plausible than a full stop. President Barack Obama, for instance, laid out a plan last week to cut oil imports by a third by diversifying toward renewable energies and relying on nuclear power.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aItaly and China plan one-year moratoriums in new construction for nuclear power, and Japan intends to carry out a policy review. In Germany, chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives lost power in a regional stronghold last week, partly because of her party\u2019s pro-nuclear stance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOver all, the anti-nuclear sentiment is likely to be less strong than after the more serious Chernobyl reactor explosion in the former Soviet Union in 1986. And the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 in the United States caused a severe backlash there.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialised countries, said global crude oil output had peaked in 2006, and the world is now forced to get oil from sources like oil sands and natural gas liquids.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThose alternatives, as well as renewable energy and nuclear power, are more expensive and would force the world into a more frugal future, according to Richard Heinberg, who coined the notion of \u2018Peak Everything\u2019 in his 2007 book of the same title. Fukushima could stall nuclear power, he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real upshot is we\u2019ll have less energy in the future, and it will be more expensive. We\u2019re really looking at a different kind of society,\u201d at least for the next 20 or 30 years before new breakthroughs emerge, he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOf course, theories of impending shortages have often turned out wrong, like the 1798 prediction by Thomas Malthus, the British scholar, that population growth would outstrip food production. At the time, the world population was just one billion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe right strategic response could deal with the risks of resource scarcity, oil depletion and climate change, said Nick Mabey at the London-based environment group E3G.\u000a\u000aAnd the tsunami was beyond the design of the Fukushima plant. \u201cThe real challenge is to improve our ability to predict natural and man-made disasters,\u201d he said. Some green groups said that there was no trade-off and that renewable energy coupled with energy efficiency could solve the problems.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSven Teske, director of renewable energy at the environmental group Greenpeace International, said big shifts were under way with developed nations closing more coal-fired plants than they opened.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a phase-out of coal already. The reality is that everybody is moving towards renewables and gas. But some of the government rhetoric will remain in favour of nuclear,\u201d he said.

VMUMBAI: A small drop in the ocean, but a huge dividend for life on Earth! Though demand is increasing by the day, an initiative by people to go in for energy-efficient appliances has helped the country inch ahead in saving power, thus its generation, and natural resources required for its generation.This little step towards climate change-the global agenda set for reducing carbon emissions affecting the ozone layer-has helped the country avoid the setting up of a 2,868 MW power plant over the last three years and the use of over 20 million tones of crude oil. However, a recent survey doesn't talk about the saving of coal in the process.A review of a bureau of energy efficiency ( BEE ) survey by the national productivity council (NPC) reveals that mainly the sale of energy-saving devices (which are replacing conventional gadgets) from 2009 to 2010 has helped the country avoid the setting up of a 1,363 MW power plant. This is up from 881 MW in 2008-09.In 2007-08, the first year in which the review of the sale of energy-efficient appliances was done, the country had saved 623 MW. Of the total 2,868 MW, the amount saved only due to the sale of star-rated appliances was 2,179 MW.As per BEE's original survey, the amount of power generation savings over the last three years (2007-10) stands at 3,730 MW, against NPC estimates of 2,868 MW. The survey, analyzed in September 2010 and released early this year, claims that the country avoided the use of 22.51 million tones of crude oil for power generation.Top among gadgets which largely helped save power generation are air-conditioners-the most energy-guzzling device. Many people's switch to star-rated ACs helped save 1455.89 MW of the total 2179 MW saved only through the sale of star-rated appliances.The survey is based on data on the sale of star-rated (or energy efficient) appliances like refrigerators, ceiling fans, storage water-heaters, agricultural pump sets, colour televisions and tubelights collected from across the country. Surveyors interacted with stakeholders like generation and distribution companies, residential and commercial consumers and industrial giants.The other device that has helped the country save on power generation is the refrigerator-481 MW was saved as people bought new star-rated energy efficient versions. While the replacement of direct-cool refrigerators has helped save 317.51 MW, new frost-free refrigerators save 163.22 MW.The replacement of incandescent bulbs with fluorescent tubelights has helped the country avoid the generation of 160 MW power, followed by 42.25 MW by the agricultural pumps' energy-efficient models. New colour televisions have avoided the generation of around 26.96 MW as people phased out old sets.The contribution of ceiling fans, water-heaters and distribution transformers stands at 1.69 MW, 4.75 MW and 6.69 MW.Power experts said BEE has a lot to work on replacing water-heaters, ceiling fans and TV sets with energy-efficient versions, as savings on them have not increased much. "Promoting these gadgets, including irons and microwaves, in energy-efficient avatars should be the next campaign now," the experts said.

VVARANASI: At a time when weather experts and environmentalists around the world are worried about the repercussions of climate change due to global warming, a young scientist from National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi, contrarily believes that the world is gearing to face ice age conditions, may be after 500 years. And, he has strong reasons to justify his stand as he believed that more than natural disasters including climate change, it is the man-made disaster that would bring such conditions sooner than later."We are already witnessing one of the coldest April month in the last one decade this year and human interference and its continuous fight with nature is going to bring conditions that would promote situation like an ice age where icy winds would be common, said Alok Mukherjee, young scientist from NPL and scientific secretary, South Asian START committee, Centre on Global Change while talking to TOI on Friday. Ruling out the worries about glacier meltdown across the globe that threatens to increase sea level putting the existence of a number of island nations in the world including Bangladesh under risk, he emphasised that it is not the glacier melting but the tilting of Bangladesh due to continental drift making the sea level to rise from one side.Mukherjee was in the city to participate in the two-day workshop on `Role of higher education in disaster management in India,' the first-ever workshop organised by the newly formed Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University which began on Friday.Saying that trajectory flow of winds and pollutants across the country are responsible for bringing a number of unexpected conditions, including more rainfall and flood in Rajasthan, he said that these conditions have also made Sunderbans (biggest mangroove forests) in the country more polluted than Kolkata. Today, Kathmandu in Nepal has become one of the most polluted hill stations in the world and it owes the conditions to increased human interference, leading to more carbon footprints (increase of black carbon and greenhouse gases) in the region.The increase in pollution is leading to dual radiation of sun rays in the atmosphere, the conditions that are also preventing hazards of ultraviolet sun rays. Even, La Nina, the weather phenomenon blamed for icy conditions are less active than anticipated and various shape of earth's orbit which range from elliptical and oblongal to spherical is to be blamed for climate change, he added.Another interesting theory for climate change was based on predictions focused on solar cycle that takes 11 years to complete. The solar cycle is dependent on number of sun spots and predictions and could be accurately calculated based on the number of sun spots. The sun spots in 2004 were found to be significantly reduced from 2040 to 90 and it caused climatic disturbance, the next solar cycle is likely to completed around 2014-15, he said.

VVARANASI: The Himalayas that guard the north-eastern parts of our country are vulnerable to landslides and erosion even without human interference. "There is an urgent need to come up with preparations to mitigate the disaster in the region," said noted Himalayan ecologist and former vice-chancellor, HNB Garhwal University , SP Singh while inaugurating the two-day national workshop on 'Role of Higher Education in Disaster Management in India: Issues and Challenges', organised by the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development (IESD), Banaras Hindu University, on Friday.Saying recent studies on climate change-induced disaster in Himalaya indicated that one of the youngest folded mountains in the country was warming with a speed even surpassing expectations, Singh emphasised that even Himalayan glaciers were receding faster than glaciers in other parts of the world. "If efforts to mitigate the disasters (natural disasters) are not initiated, disturbing conditions like spread of vector-borne diseases (due to warm and moist conditions), food insecurity, scarcity of water and disturbance due to more floods and droughts will be witnessed in the region," he added.Presiding over the inaugural function, vice-chancellor, BHU, DP Singh stressed on the need for imparting more education in schools and seats of higher learning towards various natural disasters and their effective management for sustainability of the country. He also said IESD, the fourth institute in the university, would contribute to policy making and sustainable development in the coming years.Throwing light on newly created institute at the university that was organising its first-ever national workshop, director, IESD, AS Raghubanshi said the national-level institute had been established at BHU in accordance with the UN visualisation that called for contribution of higher education for dissemination of appropriate knowledge and competence in the area of environmental protection and sustainable development. He also said the institute would be dedicated to a better understanding of critical issues related to sustainable development through guided research.Organising secretary Kavita Shah gave detailed structure of the two-day workshop that was divided into five technical sessions. Joint organising secretary RK Mall introduced the theme of the workshop to the participants.Why disaster mitigation in Himalayas is critical# Himalayas are makers of the Indian sub-continent's climate# They trap moistures of winds from the south and intercept cold winds from the north# They are humidity contributors in the northern plains of the country# Ecosystem services flow are maintained by the Himalayas# They are biggest source of water towers, the largest snow ice area (about 35,000 sq km) outside polar caps on the earth

VUpdated: Sat, Jul 02 2011. 05 11 PM IST\u000a\u000aFinding a new and better solution for an everyday problem is the goal of many visionary entrepreneurs. But most of the imaginative proposals that I receive every day from idealistic business leaders who hope to address our society\u2019s greatest challenges, such as climate change and protecting the environment, require massive investment, with years of research and development before launch. How to finance such ventures, most of which will not bring immediate gains?\u000a\u000aOver the past few centuries, many governments have offered prizes to encourage people to tackle the most pressing technical problems of their time. My favourite example is the Longitude Prize\u2014a 20,000 award established by the British government in 1714 to prompt scientists and navigators to look for a more accurate way for ships to determine their position east or west of a fixed point on the globe. More than 10 inventors received grants through the Longitude Prize over the next 50 years for their contributions to the solution; the main winner was John Harrison, inventor of the marine chronometer.\u000a\u000aToday most of our challenges are so complicated that they require truly enormous investments of time, effort and capital. The Ansari Space X Prize, at $10 million the largest such award in history, was won in 2004 by Scaled Composites, led by engineer Burt Rutan, for building and launching SpaceShipOne\u2014a craft capable of carrying passengers to 100km above earth\u2019s surface twice within two weeks. The teams chasing the $10 million prize collectively spent more than $100 million.\u000a\u000aAnd in the end, that prize was the catalyst for the founding of a commercial space sector. I was so impressed by the achievement that the Virgin Group established a new space tourism business, Virgin Galactic, and sealed a deal with Scaled Composites to build a launch system and space ship for our operation, thus taking a prize concept and using it for a commercial venture. Virgin Galactic and other companies joined the space race\u2014a field in which previously only government agencies had competed.\u000a\u000aClimate change has the potential to destroy ecosystems and impact the lives of billions. It is the responsibility of business to contribute solutions, since industry has been historically a part of the problem; and so in 2007, our group decided to launch the Virgin Earth Challenge to promote the invention of technologies that remove greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. The winner must demonstrate a safe, scalable and commercially viable design to take man-made greenhouse gases directly out of the air at the rate of 1 billion tonnes per year. To put that figure in perspective, total carbon emissions from all human activity add up to about 8 billion tonnes per year.\u000a\u000aWe received more than 2,500 entries from all over the world, ranging from wildly optimistic concept papers to proposals from accredited scientists conducting tests on carbon storage technologies. None appear likely to reach commercial viability soon; there is a lot of work ahead if we are going to develop sustainable businesses in this field. Indeed, as one scientist told our Earth Challenge team, all the investments on carbon capture and storage research to date probably do not match the $25 million prize.\u000a\u000aThat said, with so many power stations, factories, cars, livestock, ships, aircraft and so forth\u2014the list is long\u2014pumping all that carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, the goal of taking 1 billion tonnes back out is ambitious, but not impossible. Our entire society needs to undergo a series of fundamental changes to cut carbon emissions from everyday life. Virgin businesses are starting at home by addressing their own sustainability issues, examining every process for opportunities to reduce, reuse and recycle.\u000a\u000aOur prize will only be effective if it is part of a wider system of support for development in this field that can get ideas from the eureka moment to fully functioning operations. We have made a large investment via the Virgin Green Fund to back pioneering companies working on biofuels, solar energy, and energy-saving technologies. We have also provided financial backing for the Carbon War Room, which is highlighting ways for businesses to get involved in the fight against greenhouse gases and encouraging investors to back green, clean technologies.\u000a\u000aThe upcoming transformation of our society presents one of the greatest business opportunities of the next 100 years. This will require patience as well as perseverance; to anticipate what\u2019s next and plan for that situation, as well as taking advantage of what\u2019s immediately before you. The prize we are offering and our efforts in this field are part of our strategy for this future.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aClimate change is a major challenge faced by rainfed areas through long spells of drought and followed by heavy rains causing floods, according to the Director of Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), B. Venkateswaralu.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at the two-day national workshop on \u201cDryland Development and Maximising Crop Productivity\u201d at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, he pointed out that the concept of \u201cconservation agriculture\u201d and energy efficient pumpsets could help overcome this problem.\u000a\u000a\u201cConservation agriculture involves minimum or zero tillage with less disturbance to the soil and leaving the crop residuals on the soil surface as much as possible. Energy efficient pumpsets reduces the emission of green house gases which contribute to climatic change,\u201d Mr. Venkateswaralu said.\u000a\u000aHe pointed out that mechanisation of agriculture in dryland areas was a matter of great concern due to the inability of the farmers to buy mechanized equipment. This challenge could be addressed through Operational Research Projects (ORP).\u000a\u000aIn the ORP, the improved machinery was demonstrated in farmers' fields which would enable them to suggest creation of workable institutional mechanisms. The CRIDA was currently working on such ORPs on farmers' fields, he added.\u000a\u000aHe drew attention to supplemental irrigational facility through farm ponds during rainy season. A mission mode approach was necessary for water harvesting through farm ponds by ORP for which National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) needed to be merged with activities of the Department of Agricultural Activities.\u000a\u000aVice-Chancellor of the university Murugesa Boopathi said that the low productivity in dryland areas was due to frequent droughts, degraded soils, sub-optimal nutrient application, low-nutrient use efficiency and nutrient mining.\u000a\u000aMr. Murugesa Boopathi urged farmers to grow the \u201cANNA 4\u201d rice variety released by the TNAU. This variety gave a yield of 3.2 tonnes a hectare as compared to 1.2 tonnes of other varieties.\u000a\u000aThe Tamil Nadu Government provided 50 percent subsidy to farmers for procurement of farm machinery. To promote mechanisation, TNAU proposed to establish model farms in two of its research stations at Cuddalore and Bhavanisagar where it would demonstrate and educate farmers.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe tax Australia would charge its major polluters for carbon gas emissions will be set by July at a price far below a consultant\u2019s forecast of what would force a switch to greener technology, the government said Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe still-undetermined starting price would be \u201cwell south\u201d of 40 Australian dollars (US$42) a metric ton (AU$44 a U.S. ton), Climate Change Minister Greg Combet said.\u000a\u000aA consultant to the government described that amount as the tipping point where the tax would force power generators to switch from coal to cleaner gas technology, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday. The consultant\u2019s report will be made public Wednesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are other views in the electricity-generating industry about what would happen at different price scenarios,\u201d Mr. Combet told reporters.\u000a\u000aAustralia is one of the world\u2019s worst greenhouse gas polluters per capita because it relies heavily on its abundant coal reserves for electricity.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Julia Gillard announced in February that a carbon tax will be applied to Australia\u2019s biggest industrial polluters from July 1, 2012.\u000a\u000aContentious details still undecided include the tax price and how much to compensate hard\u2014hit industries and householders as they make the transition.\u000a\u000aThe carbon tax would be the main tool to meet the government\u2019s pledge to reduce Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020 to at least by 5 percent below 2000 levels.\u000a\u000aBut Ms. Gillard\u2019s Labour Party does not hold a majority in either parliament chamber so will need the support of independents and the minor Greens party to make the tax a reality.\u000a\u000aAustralia and the United States had been the only industrialized countries to refuse to accept reduction targets on carbon emissions until the centre-left Labour Party was elected in Australia in 2007. But Labour\u2019s attempts to pass such legislation have failed.\u000a\u000aThe main opposition party opposes the tax, arguing it would add to the cost of living for ordinary Australians.\u000a\u000aThe government says the revenue received from the tax will be paid back to low-income householders as compensation for the price rises.

VORLANDO, FLORIDA: SAP, the world\u2019s largest maker of business management software, is cornering a \u20ac 7.5-billion ($11 billion) market for products that help companies increase productivity while limiting the effect on the environment. At its annual Sapphire conference this week in Orlando , Florida, SAP is showing how software that lets businesses monitor and manage such things as their carbon footprints and the number of employee sick-days can couple with new mobile and data-analysis products to boost efficiency .\u000a\u000aSAP\u2019s sustainability software , used by about 1,700 customers, was one of the company\u2019s fastest growing segments last year, said Daniel Schmid, vice-president of sustainability operations . Large enterprises worldwide will spend as much as $12 billion on software and hardware related to sustainability this year alone, according to researcher Gartner. SAP is a good distance ahead of the field, said Stephen Stokes, managing vice-president at Gartner.\u000a\u000aTo compete with IBM, which incorporates both software and hardware solutions in its Smarter Planet offer, SAP will need to find business partners, he said. Among customers that purchased SAP\u2019s sustainability software are Baker Hughes (BHI), the oilfield services provider, Deere & Co, the largest maker of farm equipment, and De Beers, the world\u2019s biggest diamond-producer , according to the Walldorf, Germany-based software company.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a sizeable business for us, Peter Graf, SAP\u2019s chief sustainability officer, said in Orlando. We\u2019ve just started, this is a young discipline. Sustainability software generated a three-digit million euros amount in revenue for SAP last year, Schmid said. In a joint study with McKinsey & Co on the market , SAP predicted that the addressable market for SAP\u2019s solutions would be worth as much as a total of \u20ac 7.5 billion between 2009 and 2014.\u000a\u000aAdrian Bowles, vice-president and principal analyst at Constellation Research, recently analyzed software offerings for energy and carbon management and named companies like Hara Software and C3, founded by Thomas Siebel. Hewlett-Packard has struck partnership deals with both. We have deep pockets to invest, Graf said, citing SAP s acquisitions of Clear Standards, a carbon-management software company and Technidata, which makes software helping companies comply with environmental , health and safety regulations.

VGlobal food output may be hurt as climate change brings more extreme weather over the next decade,with China likely set for harsher droughts and North America getting heavier rain,said the World Meteorological Organization.\u000a\u000aExtreme events will become more intense in the future,especially the heat waves and extreme precipitations, Omar Baddour,a division chief at the United Nations agency,said in a phone interview. That,combined with less rainfall in some regions like the Mediterranean region and China,will affect crop production and agriculture. The more extreme weather \u2014 including in the US,may disrupt harvests,possibly cutting production of grains,livestock and cooking oils and boosting prices. Global food costs reached a record in February,stoking inflation and pushing millions into poverty.\u000a\u000aWe foresee with high confidence in climate projections that intense precipitation in some parts of the world will be more intense,and drought will be more intense, said Baddour,who has tracked the subject for more than two decades. Extreme heat waves will also be more intense and more frequent.\u000a\u000aThe UN food and sgriculture organizations world food price index,which tracks 55 food-commodity items,rose nine times in the past 10 months,with the gauge peaking at 237.24 in February. The index climbed to 232.07 last month.\u000a\u000aBaddours comments add to projections that more extreme weather may affect farm production. Sunny Verghese,chief executive officer at Olam International ,among the worlds three biggest suppliers of rice,forecast that food- supply chains face massive disruptions from climate change.\u000a\u000aDrought in China has affected 6.5 million hectares of farmland,the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters said on its website. China has ordered the operator of the Three Gorges Dam to release water to replenish the Yangtze River and counter the local regions lowest rainfall in half a century.\u000a\u000aThe drought in China may cut early-season rice output if theres no adequate rain over the next two weeks,according to industry researcher Cngrain.com. If the drought doesnt end in two weeks,the impact on the regions rice will no doubt be significant, said Zhang Lu,an analyst at the group.\u000a\u000aFood costs are at dangerous levels after pushing 44 million people into poverty since June,World Bank President Robert Zoellick said Feb. 15. That adds to the more than 900 million people around the world who go hungry each day,he said.\u000a\u000aClimate change,high-and-volatile food and energy prices,population and income growth will put intense pressure on land and water and challenge global food security as never before,according to Mark Rosegrant,director of environment and production technology at the International Food Policy Research Institute.Agricultural research is needed to adapt farming to climate change,Olivier de Schutter,the United Nations special adviser on the right to food,said at a conference on May 23.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VNEW DELHI: Global environment NGO Greenpeace today staged a protest against telco Bharti Airtel for not disclosing the measures taken by the company to lower its carbon emissions, including the shift towards renewable sources of energy to power its network operations.The latest development comes after TRAI's recommendations in April on fostering environment-friendly telecom policies wherein it suggested measures to reduce dependency on fossil fuel and a format to measure carbon footprint in the telecom network. DoT is now studying these recommendations."The company's failure to respond specifically to key issues on their carbon and energy management has left us with no choice but to come here (at protest site) and ask them to act on their professed commitments," Mrinmoy Chattaraj, Campaigner, Climate and Energy, Greenpeace India said.Greenpeace said it held a meeting with Bharti Airtel's representative after the demonstration but the company representative remained non-committal on their demand.The environment group has been demanding that airtel should publicly disclose carbon emissions from its entire business operations and establish progressive emission reduction targets.These include commitment to shift the sourcing of 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources and phasing out diesel usage in its business operations by 2015.The NGO has called for airtel to catalyse a low-carbon economic growth, by using its brand power to advocate strong policies that promote renewable energy.Last month, Greenpeace estimated that the diesel consumed by telecom companies for providing power at telecom towers was causing the exchequer an annual loss of about Rs 2,600 crore in the form of subsidy.Bharti Airtel, the biggest telecom operator in terms of subscriber base, said it has started GreenTowers P7 initiative that aims at reducing diesel usage."The GreenTowers P7 programme is scoped for 22,000 tower sites, primarily rural areas having low or no Grid Power availability, out of which 5,500 sites have already been implemented in the first year as part of this 3-year programme," Bharti Airtel said in a statement."Once completed, the initiative will reduce diesel consumption by 66 million litres per year with a significant carbon-dioxide reduction of around 1.5 lakhs metric tonnes per year," the statement said.The company added it has already deployed alternate energy sources at around 1050 sites and saved 6.9 mn litres of diesel and Rs 280 million for the company.According to the company, its Integrated Power Management System IPMS ) and variable speed DC generators (DCDG), has reduced diesel consumption by 1.2 mn litres and already saved Rs 47 million across almost 900 sites.

VThe Karnataka Climate Change Action Plan (KCCAP) \u2014 a comprehensive report on the impact of change on the climate of the State, prepared by Bangalore Climate Change Initiative-Karnataka (BCCI-K) states that failure to protect the environment will impact forest area to the extent of 38 per cent by 2030 and most areas in the State will experience rise in temperature from 1.8 to 2.2 degrees Celsius.\u000a\u000aThe report was submitted to the Government by the former Chairman of the Legislative Council, B.K. Chandrashekar, on Wednesday. Additional Chief Secretary and Development Commissioner Meera Saxena received the report in the presence of Chairman of the Legislative Council D.H. Shankaramurthy.\u000a\u000aWith the Prime Minister's initiative to formulate a National Action Plan on climate change in 2008, all the State governments were asked to prepare State-level action plans; and the BCCI-K, spearheaded by Prof. Chandrashekar, brought together distinguished experts from several prestigious institutions to prepare the Karnataka Climate Change Action Plan. Scientists and researchers representing premier institutes, including Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSSTP),Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) and the University of Agricultural Sciences were involved in preparing the report. The report has been prepared in close association with the \u2018India Observatory' London School of Economics, led by the renowned economist and climate change expert Lord Nicholas Stern. World Bank has provided financial support for the study. The KCCAP that submitted its interim report in March, has now submitted its final report. The final report focusses on the climate variability, climate change projections, impact on forests, agriculture and water resources, assessment of socio-economic vulnerability and adaptive capacity and mitigation options in the energy sector.\u000a\u000aImpact on forest area\u000a\u000aThe report reveals that the area under forest is marginally declining in the State, while the area under dense forests has declined by 8 per cent from 2001-2007. The forests of Uttara Kannada, Chikmagalur and Shimoga districts are particularly vulnerable to the projected climate change. Over all, around 38 per cent of the forest area is projected to be under impact of climate change by 2030. There is a long-term negative trend of about 6 per cent precipitation of rainfall in the last 50 years (1954-2004) and most of the areas of the State are projected to experience a warming ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 degrees Celsius. The rainfall variability is very high in Chickballapur, Chitradurga, Gadag, Kolar, Mandya and Tumkur districts and temperature will increase in Raichur, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Yadgir districts, the report shows.\u000a\u000aFinal report on climate change\u000a\u000ait was prepared by experts

VThe international market in carbon credits has suffered an almost total collapse, with only $1.5billion of them traded last year \u2014 the lowest since the system opened in 2005, according to a report from the World Bank.\u000a\u000aA fledgling market in greenhouse gas emissions in the US also declined, and only the EU\u2019s internal market in carbon remained healthy, worth $120billion.\u000a\u000aThe international market in carbon credits was brought about under the Kyoto protocol, as a way of injecting much needed investment into low-carbon technology in the developing world. Under the system, known as the clean development mechanism, projects such as windfarms or solar panels in developing countries are awarded carbon credits for every tonne of carbon avoided. These credits are bought by rich countries to count towards their emissions reduction targets.\u000a\u000aFrom 2005, when the Kyoto protocol finally came into force, to 2009 the system generated a total of $25billion for developing countries. But last year's $1.5billion was less even than the amount paid for credits in the first year of operation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis bodes very badly for the countries we are trying to help,\u201d said Andrew Steer, envoy for climate change at the World Bank. \u201cThe (carbon) market is failing us. It is not delivering what we feel is necessary.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf the poor performance continued, it would mean increasing greenhouse gas emissions, he predicted. \u201cWe are heading for a 3C or 4C world (temperature rise).\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of the problem is uncertainty over the future of the Kyoto protocol. The current provisions of the 1997 treaty, which took years to come into force because of wrangling among governments, are due to expire in 2012 and there is no agreement yet on a continuation.\u000a\u000aThe US refuses to take part in the treaty, and Russia, Japan and Canada said at the recent G8 meeting they would not continue under Kyoto.

VNEW DELHI: The cabinet has approved setting up a Rs 486 crore contingency fund to compensate solar power producers for possible default by state electricity boards , giving a boost to the rapidly growing sector. The fund would be utilized for phase 1 of the National Solar Mission and would act as a security to the central agency purchasing solar power from the developers. This scheme will facilitate setting up 1000 MW grid connected solar power projects.An official from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said this funding would expedite the process of financial closure of the pending projects. Termed as a payment security mechanism, the fund would result in creation of Solar Payment Security Account (SPSA). This would be provided to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for ensuring availability of adequate funds to address all possible payment related risks in case of defaults by distribution Utilities for the bundled power. NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) is the nodal agency which will purchase Solar Power from the developers and sell it to the utilities bundled with unallocated Thermal Power available from NTPC.The Payment Security Scheme (PSS) will be implemented by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and NVVN has the provision to draw funds as per the requirement. MNRE would allocate funds for each year for the account.A Fund Management Committee (FMC), comprising of the Secretary, MNRE, representatives from Planning Commission and from Ministries of Expenditure and power will oversee the overall implementation of this scheme and shall be empowered to issue any directions to remove any difficulties with regards to its implementation.The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) was launched by the Government in 2010 as a part of National Action Plan on Climate Change. It envisages 20,000 MW of grid-connected solar power by 2022 and 2,000 MW equivalent off-grid solar applications.Payment Security Mechanism approved by the Government is critical for achieving financial closure by the developers of the solar power projects given that the associated risks, especially, pertaining to technology and performance are not fully understood under Indian conditions.

VMAJOR ISSUE: Air pollutants like black carbon, methane and ground level ozone most often result from soot and gases formed by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, wood and biomass. A fire in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona. Photo: AP | Photo Credit: Jae C. Hong\u000a\u000aGlobal warming could be slowed down if governments cleaned up what's known as black carbon from industry and cooking fires, 50 of the world's leading atmospheric scientists said on June 14.\u000a\u000aMajor air pollutants like black carbon, methane and ground level ozone mostly result from the soot and gases formed by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, wood and biomass. These pollutants only remain in the atmosphere for a few days or weeks and are mostly seen by governments as important for health and air quality.\u000a\u000aBut the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), working with the World Meteorological Organisation, said these \u201cshort-lived climate forcers\u201d contribute as much as 25-30 per cent to present-day climate change emissions, and if controlled would also provide dramatic health and farming benefits.\u000a\u000a\u201cA small number of emission reduction measures ... offer dramatic public health, agricultural, economic and environmental benefits,\u201d said Achim Steiner, the head of the UNEP.\u000a\u000aBlack carbon affects climate by intercepting and absorbing sunlight, darkening snow and ice when deposited and helping to form clouds. It is most noticeable at the poles, on glaciers and in mountain regions \u2014 all environments which are showing the greatest impact of climate change.\u000a\u000aGlacier melting, rainfall\u000a\u000aThe full impact of black carbon is still being assessed but it is linked to the melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas, disruption of traditional rainfall patterns in India and Africa, and low yields of maize, rice, wheat and soya bean crops in Asia and elsewhere. It is also partly generated by wood-burning stoves and dirty diesel cars.\u000a\u000aMethane, a powerful global warming gas, is largely emitted from oil, coal and waste treatment plants, and ground-level ozone comes largely from traffic.\u000a\u000aAccording to the UNEP report, launched on June 14 in Bonn at the resumed UN climate talks, ground-level ozone and black carbon together could be reducing crop yields by as much as 50m tonnes a year and be leading to 2.5m premature human deaths a year from poor outdoor air quality. A preliminary version of the report was published in February.\u000a\u000aA team of 50 scientists convened by UNEP studied the climactic impact of the air pollutants and proposed 16 measures to address them. These included removing the dirtiest vehicles from the roads, improving cooking stoves, banning the burning of straw and farm waste, and better technology for the world's brick kilns.\u000a\u000aThe authors suggested that, if adopted, tighter controls on the pollutants could cut 0.5C off rising temperatures. Such a reduction would help the 193 countries who agreed at the UN climate conference in Cancun last December to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C. Temperatures have already risen by around 0.8C since the industrial revolution, and earlier this month UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said the 2C target was \u201cnot enough\u201d and governments should be aiming to limit rises to 1.5C to avoid \u201cbig, big trouble.\u201d In six months' time the scientists hope to report on which countries could do most and how much it might cost.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor many of the measures, especially the methane ... there are cost savings,\u201d Johan Kuylenstierna of the Stockholm Environment Institute, told Reuters. It is possible that governments will seek an outline agreement to reduce the global emissions of the pollutants at the Rio+20 earth summit next June.\u000a\u000aAir pollution is a serious issue in both rich and poor countries and because the benefits of cleaning it up are likely to be seen quickly, there is some hope that governments will agree to taking stronger action. In addition, most countries and regions, like Europe, already have laws and measures in place intended to reduce air pollutants. A 2009 report by the Dutch environment agency said efforts to cut carbon emissions could save millions of lives because of cleaner air. \u2014  Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2011

VSupport for Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard is now even lower than that of her predecessor whom she ousted almost a year ago,driven down by her government\u2019s push to impose a deeply unpopular tax on carbon emissions. The next scheduled election is not for two years,but media have begun speculating that Gillard could also be dumped by nervous backbenchers unless her Labor Party manages to engineer a rapid turnaround in the next few months.\u000a\u000aHer approval rating has shed five points in just a fortnight to 30 percent,lower than former prime minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s rating when Gillard replaced him in a partyroom coup ahead of last year\u2019s dead-heat election,a Newspoll in The Australian newspaper showed.\u000a\u000aThe poll numbers are dreadful and they are going backwards. There must be a sense of panic,Monash University political analyst Nick Economou said. The crucial question now,Economou said,was whether there was anyone within Labor willing to take Gillard\u2019s leadership knowing they would lose the next election.\u000a\u000aThe only real prospect would be the return of Rudd. But that won\u2019t happen because he does not have support,and it would make the government look like even more of a farce than it is at the moment,he said.\u000a\u000aLabor wants to set a carbon tax on 1,000 of the biggest polluting companies from July next year to fight global warming,with a move to an emissions trading scheme three to five years later. Legislation underpinning the plan will enter parliament within months.\u000a\u000aBut Gillard needs to convince a handful of Green and independent MPs,who hold the balance of power,to back the scheme,which opinion surveys say is opposed by 60 percent of voters,with only 30 percent in favour.\u000a\u000aMining giants including Xstrata Plc and Anglo-American Plc have warned that the planned carbon pollution reduction scheme could threaten sovereign risk and slash investment,output and cost thousands of jobs.\u000a\u000aGillard\u2019s failure to deliver her climate policy would seriously damage her and Labor,despite the distance to the next elections in 2013. I am determined and the government is determined to get on with the job of pricing carbon. It\u2019s in the national interest and we will pursue that national interest,she told parliament on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe conservative opposition coalition,which is against a carbon price,has a 10 point lead over Labor,although its leader Tony Abbott,is also struggling to find approval. Gillard still leads Abbott as preferred prime minister,with 41 percent of those surveyed by Newspoll supporting her,while 38 percent support the combative Abbott,who has been criticised for excess negativity as he tries to force early elections. But Gillard won support from a group of leading scientists,medical researchers and environmental campaigners,who penned an open letter to Australian newspapers arguing that a carbon tax was essential to combat climate change.\u000a\u000aAustralians are the top per-capita emitters of carbon dioxide among developed nations,with more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s electricity coming from reliance on ageing coal-fired power stations.\u000a\u000aDetails of the tax,including a starting price and levels of compensation to business and households,is being worked out by a multi-party committee. The government wants details announced by early July,and laws passed later this year.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

VFollowing the approval of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, the state forest & environment department has sent the final ' (CCAP)' to the Union ministry of environment & forests (MoEF).\u000a\u000aThe final CCAP was sent today to the special secretary, by Aurobindo Behera, principal secretary (forest & environment), Orissa government. It may be noted that Orissa is the first state in the country to have prepared such a plan after the ministry had issued directions to all states to come out with action plans for environment protection.\u000a\u000aThe CCAP envisages action to be taken on 303 points for fine tuning the ideal balance between industrialization and environment protection. Meanwhile, work has already begun on 140 out of the 303 action points. A special cell has been created within the state forest & environment department to oversee the implementation of the plan.\u000a\u000aThe plan implementation involves an expenditure of around Rs 17,000 crore.\u000a\u000a"Though funds have not been tied up specifically for implementation of the Action Plan, work has already been initiated in sectors like agriculture, energy, forest and disaster management. The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management & Planning Authority (CAMPA) funds and World Bank funds available with some departments are being utilized in the implementation of the plan. The Action Plan is expected to help the state to move towards a carbon conscious and climate resilient state\u201d, said Bhagirathi Behera, director (environment), Orissa government.\u000a\u000aIt may be noted that the state chief minister had constituted a high-level coordination committee headed by the Chief Secretary to steer the preparation of the draft Action Plan. Eleven working groups were constituted on agriculture, coastal zones and disasters, energy, fisheries and animal resources, forestry, health, industry, mining, transport, urban planning and water resources.\u000a\u000aFor agriculture, the Action Plan has suggested a climate friendly agriculture policy for the state, capacity building to cope with climate change, people centric watershed development programmes, developing water efficient micro irrigation methods as well as improving monitoring and surveillance techniques.\u000a\u000aOther key priorities in the sector are developing sustainable soil, water and crop management practices, increasing the area under perennial fruit plantation to help cope with uncertain weather patterns and undertaking more research on agricultural implications of climate change.\u000a\u000aSimilarly for industries, the key priorities are setting medium-term emission targets for the thermal power plants, promoting the use of bulk waste material like fly ash and slag, implement a system of compensatory water harvesting at the industrial clusters, integrating climate change concerns in policies and plans for industrial development, carrying out heat island study for Talcher and Jharsuguda area, training various stakeholders on climate change issues and carrying out energy efficiency study for iron and steel, thermal power, aluminium and cement sectors.\u000a\u000aIn the energy sector, the Action Plan has prioritized on generating cleaner energy through clean coal approaches, reduction of transmission and distribution losses, fly ash utilization and emission reduction from power plants, promotion of small and medium hydel plants, promotion of grid based wind power generation and harness biomass potential.

VNEW DELHI: How ambitious are the emission reduction targets rich nations are ready to adopt for 2020? Pretty low, suggests a technical report that the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has prepared. The report is based on compiling the offers developed countries made after the Cancun summit last year.Take the case of the US. It has offered to cut its emissions by a mere 4% below 1990 levels. This too is predicated on developing countries like India, China, South Africa and Brazil willing to make similar commitments. Even for this meagre and conditional target, the US wants to take advantage of the cheap carbon credits it can purchase from developing countries instead of taking actions at home, which would more expensive and also impact lifestyles.But all this is also not a firm commitment from the US. It has informed the world that it might alter these targets based on what its Congress decides in the future. Also, there is no time frame when a final figure would emerge.Compare this with the target of 35%-40% reduction developing countries had demanded from rich countries to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius.The US might have made one of the worst offers, but even the other rich nations are also willing to reduce their emissions by only 13%-18%. And almost all of these countries have put pre-conditions, demanding developing countries give commitments and open their economies to international scrutiny.But look at how this would set the world up for an unequal sharing of atmospheric space. By 2020, if the US sticks to even this meagre offer, its citizens would enjoy per capita annual emissions of 16.8 tonnes, while an average European would enjoy 7.7-8.8 tonnes per capita and an Australian 15.7-19.9 tonnes per capita. The rubric of commitments rich countries are asking developing nations could limit India at below 3 tonnes per capita for eternity.This is not a new data. It has been floating informally for a while, but this is for the first time that the UN climate secretariat has analyzed it to show what kind of global regime is on offer.The offers could bode ill for emerging economies with the world having committed to keeping temperatures from rising more than 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrialization era. This has rendered a de-facto upper limit on total global emissions. Now, if the rich countries do not take on a fair share of their responsibility, the burden for the rest would fall on developing world by default.That's why, the emerging economies have been fighting hard not to let an explicit global cap on emissions be brought in unless the rich countries first spell out how much share they are ready to bear and if it's proportionate to their historic emissions or not.

VNEW DELHI: South Africa is all set to kick off its preparations for the year-end UN climate change conference at Durban. Environment ministers from countries representing the entire spectrum of interests in the climate process will be meeting in Berlin for the Petersberg Climate Dialogue. The first major ministerial meeting, since the Cancun climate conference, aims to identify the deliverables at Durban and build the political environment required to push the process through.As with the first Petersberg Dialogue held last year, the July 3-4 ministerial is the joint initiative of the Germany and incoming presidency of the Conference of Parties. Last year's meet chaired by Germany and Mexico, in the aftermath of the Copenhagen conference, focused on ways to rebuild trust and identify areas of co-operation. This year the attempt is to create the political momentum to address the crucial issues such as ambition, equity, sources for long-term funding.This exercise gains importance as consensus has already been built on low-hanging fruits of the climate negotiation process as reflected in the Cancun Agreements. The Durban conference will therefore have to focus on the politically more contentious issues such as the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, level of ambition to reduce emissions, identifying sources for long-term finance. The Petersberg Dialogue, chaired by German Environment Minister Norbert Rottgen and South African Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, will aim to identify evolve a framework to address these issues.At the Berlin ministerial, South Africa hopes to work out the contours of what could be a "balanced and credible" Durban outcome. This will involve discussions on the fate of the second commitment period for the Kyoto protocol, the raising of ambition in dealing with climate change, making the Green Climate Fund operational, especially resolving the question of sources for long-term financing for climate change, and the technology mechanism.Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh, who is attending the ministerial, will lead the discussions along with UK Environment Minister Chris Huhne on the policy options and key issues that need to be resolved, and the elements of a Durban outcome.The prospect of a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol and identifying sources for long-term finance for climate change are key issues that would dominate the meet. The focus on these issues is expected as South Africa seeks to use the opportunity accorded by the UN climate conference to establish itself as the leader of the African continent.Both these issues are of crucial concern to the African Group. These concerns are supported by the BASIC countries, of which South Africa is a constituent. The BASIC has made it clear that it will play an active role in shaping the Durban conference.

VNEW DELHI: The effort to ensure long-term financing to address climate change is expected to be a key issue at the year-end UN climate conference to be held at Durban in South Africa. At Cancun, it was agreed that a climate fund would be set up and South Africa would like to make sure that it is operationalised at the Durban conference. A crucial issue that needs to be addressed is that of sourcing long-term finance. This is an area on which there has been little discussion, especially at the decision-making level.South Africa is keen to ensure that a decision on sources of long-term finance is agreed to at the Durban Conference. African countries are mostly classified as net recipients of climate related finance. To this end, South Africa plans to begin discussions on the issue at the Petersberg dialogue to be held in the first week of July in Germany. It is understood to have reached out to Germany to help bring the vexed issue of sources for long-term finance on the political agenda. South Africa also proposes to hold a ministerial in the run up to Durban which will deal with this issue.Consensus on the question of sources could prove to be a difficult task. There is little agreement among countries about which sources need to be tapped. A decision in Durban would aid South Africa\u2019s effort to position itself within the broader African political spectrum. The Africa group has already made a submission on the issue, stressing that a burden sharing mechanism, including assessed contribution, needs to be established to identify flows of financial support.There is a great deal of opposition and unease on a levy on aviation and maritime traffic, which among the sources that is under consideration. The European Union\u2019s decision to make all airlines flying into or through Europe for their pollution by bringing aviation within the ambit of the emission trading scheme has already met with opposition The United States and China are opposed to the move, with Beijing going so far as to put on hold its multibillion dollar order for 10 Airbus aircrafts.India too has opposed a levy on aviation and maritime traffic as it would blur the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities on which the UN convention is based. Developed countries are required to provide finances to the developing countries. The issue of long-term finance has received little attention at the decision making level. In part this can be attributed to the global economic downturn that impacted the industrialized countries. Most of the discussions on the issue has been outside the framework of the UNFCCC.The high level advisory group on finance appointed by the United nations Secretary General to look into the question of sources of long term finance, has provided a variety of sources without ranking them or indicating preferences.

VNEW DELHI: The United Nations\u2019 top climate official exceeded her brief by a mile pushing the interests of private bio-fuel companies backed by the international air transport association during a visit to India earlier this year. The plea was rejected out of hand by environment minister Jairam Ramesh Executive secretary Christiana Figueres is mandated by the UN Secretary General to steer tough climate negotiations and help build consensus among 195 countries that are members of the climate convention but she explored the possibilities of bio-fuel plantations in her talks with the government.Figueres brought up an impending visit of the IATA president with Ramesh. She informed the environment minister that the IATA chief\u2019s visit was intended to explore business possibilities of jatropha plantations for bio-fuels.The ministry recorded her advocacy on behalf of the global bio-fuel industry in minutes accessed by TOI. She noted that IATA promotes certified bio-fuels, which can be blended with diesel.She told Ramesh that some of the leading companies in the field were looking for adequate land for planting jatropha. This she suggested was to produce low emission climate friendly fuel.But Ramesh outrightly rejected the suggestion and informed Figueres that jatropha would not be allowed to compete with foods in India. Ramesh was stating the well settled government policy on not pushing bio-fuels, wary about a controversy over "diversion\u201d of land and crop for bio-fuels.He told Figueres that India did not have access to unlimited land and could not follow a model similar to one followed by Brazil. While Brazil, pushed by its own strategic interests and resources at its disposal, has backed corn-based bio-fuels, India stopped shy of promoting jatropha.In years when global food prices \u2013 particularly after the 2009 "drought\u201d \u2013 rocketed, India\u2019s enthusiasm for the green fuel dimmed. India was wary that it would impact food production. Some scientific studies also showed that the net impact of first generation bio-fuels on the environment were negative even though they helped reduce the use of fossil fuels.The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s secretariat refused to comment on the issue stating, "In principal, we cannot respond to information from unauthorized, unidentified sources.\u201dFigueres was selected for the post by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon in April 2010 in a competition where Indian government had also put up its candidate, the then environment secretary Vijai Sharma.

VGenetically modified crops have saved around 18 billion kg of CO2 gas emissions,which is equivalent to removing 8 million cars from the road,a fact that reveals importance of the newer plant technology in mitigating climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 2009,the combined permanent and additional saving through sequestration was equivalent to a saving of around 18 billion kg of CO2 or removing about 8 million cars from the road,\u201d ISAAA chairman Clive James said quoting Brookes and Barfoot,2011 (a UK-based PG Economics company).\u000a\u000aThe International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) is a not-for-profit international organization.\u000a\u000aGiven that agriculture is a significant contributor (14 per cent) of greenhouse gases (GHG) and therefore part of the problem in climate change,it is appropriate that biotech crops can be part of the solution,James said.\u000a\u000aJames,who is disciple of Nobel laureate and father of Mexican food revolution architect Norman Borlaug,rolled out these statistics at an international conference on GM crops at Hyderabad last week to highlight advantages of crop biotechnology.\u000a\u000aBesides James,ICRISAT Director General William W Dar had also underlined adoption of the newer Bt plant technology by India in a big way.\u000a\u000aThe ISAAA chief said a record 15.4 million farmers in 29 countries,including India,had planted GM crops in 148 million hectares in 2010. By 2015,which also happens to be millennium development goals year,area under GM crops is expected to reach 1 billion hectare in 40 countries,he added.\u000a\u000aDeep cuts in CO2 emissions worldwide are prescribed as the only way to prevent a future global warming catastrophe.\u000a\u000aOne of the few successes of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change in 2009 was initiative known as REDD (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) which aimed to reduce deforestation,whereas agriculture is a cause of deforestation emitting about 14 per cent of global GHG.\u000a\u000aThe global research alliance on agriculture greenhouse gases was established in December 2009 with America pledge of USD 150 billion to investigate and develop potential opportunities,which could reward farmers in poor countries for locking up carbon in their crops and soils under the aegis of clean development mechanism discussed in Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aThe ISAAA chief said biotech crops require fewer pesticide sprays which results in savings of tractor/fossil fuel and thus less CO2 emissions,he said.\u000a\u000aBesides,herbicide tolerant biotech crops encourage zero to no-till which in turn significantly reduces the loss of soil carbon and CO2 emission,he added.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

VJorhat, July 3: Tea gardens in Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Jorhat districts may soon turn to rainwater harvesting in response to change in climate and have sought help from IIT Guwahati. The chairman of the North Eastern Tea Association (NETA), Bidyananda Barkakoty, said a primary study carried out by IIT Guwahati on the impact of climate change on the water resources of the Brahmaputra basin had revealed that there would be significant changes in rainfall pattern and temperature in the future. High intensity rainfall of shorter duration and longer dry spells will affect the flood and drought scenario, Barkakoty told this correspondent. He said rainwater harvesting had become necessary for the tea gardens to withstand the long dry spells. There are nearly 160 tea gardens in the organised sectors in the three districts. Barkakoty said a seminar on climate change and water management issues was held at the associations office in Golaghat Friday. It was attended by scientists from IIT Guwahati, Tea Board officials and tea planters from the three districts. The seminar was organised by the Tea Board in association with IIT Guwahati and was coordinated by the association. A group of experts from IIT Guwahati visited several tea gardens in Karbi Anglong and Golaghat districts in the last couple of days to collect data on the impact of climate change and water management in the tea gardens. The team included professor A.K. Sarma and professor S.K. Deb. Barkakoty said the experts from IIT have expressed their willingness to help out the planters to take a scientific approach towards rainwater harvesting using the latest technology. The executive director of Tea Board, Rakesh Saini, who attended the seminar, said water management in tea gardens had assumed greater significance in recent times, as climate change footprints were visible in the region. The geographical and time pattern of rainfall is changing erratically and temperatures are rising. These variations require revisiting the available techniques of water management in tea gardens. Indigenous, innovative and cost-effective techniques of harvesting rainwater have become unavoidable, he said. Barkakoty said the IIT team had also expressed concern about the large chunks of land being eroded by the change in the courses of rivers in the three districts. Large chunks of land in many tea estates located on the banks of rivers in the three districts have been lost because of massive erosion. He said the experts had expressed concern about natural water outlets of many tea estates being blocked because of road construction and other development activities resulting in waterlogging in these gardens. Many gardens in Golaghat, Jorhat and Karbi Anglong are facing the problem of waterlogging in the rainy season due to blocking of the natural outlets.

VBANGALORE: `No' is the buzzword across the city, at least when it comes to tree felling Addressing students at a state-level seminar on `Challenges in Climate Changes' on Saturday, Prof. Jeevan Kumar, department of political science, Bangalore University, said BBMP must not have absolute authority when it comes to ecological decisions. "Taking experts' views is a must in any project. Addressing climate change calls for a united effort as a country." Environmentalist Suresh Heblikar said our economic systems are outstripping our ecosystems. He said: "With countries evading the terms of the Kyoto Protocol or Copenhagen Climate Council, the only way to tackle climate change is to open up our economy to free trade, make our population wealthier and more likely to seek a new social order that would encompass eco-awareness. Biodiversity has given us variation in our culture."For environmental researcher Ullas Kumar, the growing awareness among people is much in evidence. "When the price of onions went up to Rs 80 per kg last year, we were all aware of the untimely rains. When reports emerged on illegal mining, we were made aware of damage to our environment," he said.

VSURAT: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided to go ahead with the preparation of the master plan to turn the diamond city into 'solar city'.A stakeholder meeting was organized where the representatives from various organizations such as South Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI), Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology ( SVNIT ), Surat Builders' Association (SBA), Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (DGVCL), Torrent Power, textile industry associations etc. participated.Official sources said the master plan will be prepared by 2012 and that it will have a database of electricity consumption in the city and the estimated carbon emission levels.The master plan would set a goal of a minimum of 10 per cent reduction in the projected total demand of conventional energy at the end of five years, to be achieved through energy saving by following energy efficiency measure and generation from renewable energy installations.The master plan would be implemented by categorizing the buildings into residential apartments, commercial complexes, industries, individual houses, corporate establishments and buildings of the government and SMC.The government of India plans to develop 60 solar cities during the 11th Five Year Plan, to both meet the increasing electricity demand of its cities and to promote the growing use of renewable energies. Surat is among the three cities from Gujarat state after Rajkot and Gandhinagar to be selected under the solar cities initiative.The Union ministry of new and renewable energy would provide a grant of Rs 10 lakh per annum to SMC for implementing the project.Under the project, streetlights, energy used for water pumping and supply and maintenance of office lighting would be met through solar energy. This is expected to bring down the energy expenditure by 10 per cent.Beside, the ministry has directed the cities selected for the implementation of the project to promote the use of non-conventional energy by private buildings, including apartments where solar energy could be adopted, for common lighting and water supply."A master plan will be prepared in consultation with the stake holder committee and solar city cell that have been formed by the SMC. Once the master plan will be ready by 2012, the civic body will submit a draf plan to the union ministry of new and renewable energy for the grant of solar city status," a senior officer said.

VIndia has threatened to move World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the European Union if it fails to withdraw carbon tax to be imposed on flights landing or taking off from European airports from January 2012.\u000a\u000aEven though the additional per passenger cost would be around six US dollars, Indians would be paying approximately about one billion US dollars a year to Europe. Similar cost for China would be about four billion US dollars.\u000a\u000aMoney is not the worrying factor for India, as a senior environment ministry official puts it. But, the concern is that the tax will give kick-start similar unfair trade practices in the name of fighting climate change. Europe is already talking about imposing a similar carbon tax on imported high carbon emitting fuels from 2013-14.\u000a\u000aIn the world\u2019s first, the European Union earlier this year decided to bring aviation sector from January 2012 under EU Emission Trade Scheme, which imposed a penalty for failing to keep carbon emissions within 10,000 tonnes a year.\u000a\u000aIt would mean that a Boeing 747 flying from Delhi to London will exhaust this quota within a month and thereafter, will have to pay the environmental degradation tax for landing on European airports. The decision was taken after EU found that aviation sector was spewing 20 % more carbon dioxide into the environment than previously estimated.\u000a\u000aIndia has not bought the European claim and Indian environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan lodged a formal protest with the European Union this week terming the decision as \u201cunfair\u201d trade practice. Natarajan in a letter urged Europe to withdraw the unilateral tax till a consensus is built on the issue at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe European carbon tax is just a start of a new global tax regime to adversely hit business of emerging economies such as India and China\u2026We will have no option other than to approach WTO if it is not withdrawn,\u201d a senior government functionary said.\u000a\u000aThe issue would be discussed at a meeting called by Cabinet Secretary Ajit Kumar Seth on Friday, where officials from ministries of civil aviation, commerce and environment will participate. \u201cWe are seeking legal opinion on how we can approach WTO,\u201d the functionary said, while explaining that aviation is not trade but service sector. WTO covers only trade sector.\u000a\u000aThe issue of carbon tax came up at a recent UNFCCC meeting in Bonn, Germany, where India along with the biggest group G-77 plus China opposed it. They termed it as an unfair practice against the developing world as under UN protocol to flight change the historical polluters --- rich countries --- have obligation to reduce carbon emissions and pay to the developing world to adapt to adverse implications of climate change. \u201cBy levying carbon tax, developing countries would be paying to rich nations,\u201d a government official said.\u000a\u000aEnvironment ministry officials said India will also raise the issue at the next meeting of Basic countries --- a group of India, China, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 in August to garner more support against the decision.

VPUNE: Pune has the dubious distinction of being among five districts in the country that have the 'most significantly degraded' land.Researchers say that rapid urbanization and industrialization are among the factors responsible for the quality of the land changing for the worse.They fear that should the degradation continue, long tracts of land could well become useless for farming.Besides Pune, the other districts where the land has badly degraded are Surat (Gujarat), Ferozepur (Punjab), Hassan (Karnataka) and Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu). Thirteen other districts have been classified as having 'degraded' land.These are the findings mentioned in a report, 'Impact of climate change on land degradation over India', compiled by researchers of the National Climate Centre (NCC) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). In the study, land degradation has been examined by taking into consideration the soil moisture status during two different time periods.The researchers have observed that the land degradation will harm farming. "It will have a bearing on the quality of the land and impact the water content. If the degradation continues, it can lead to desertification of the land, rendering it useless for farming," P G Gore , director (investigations and development) at NCC, told TOI.Gore said that apart from urbanization and industrialisation, hacking of trees and rising pollution levels were other key reasons for land degradation in Pune district and other parts of the country.Gore, who prepared the report along with B A Roy and H R Hatwar , said the rainfall for the period 1901 to 1950 and 1941 to 1990 was used to calculate the moisture index (soil moisture status). "This index is calculated using the ratio of precipitation (P) to potential evapotranspiration (PE).This ratio provides a simple method of estimating the moisture status of a place. Evapotranspiration is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the land surface to the atmosphere," he explained.Gore said a P/PE ratio of less than 1 means that the moisture content of the soil is not sufficient to cope with the needs of evapotranspiration. It also means that the place has a dry climate. If the ratio is greater than 1, the availability of soil moisture is greater and the climate is humid.As per the report, the moisture index of Pune district was 0.78 from 1901 to 1950. However, it fell drastically to 0.49 in the period from 1941 to 1990."Degradation of land is a bad sign," said environment expert Mukund Ghare. "It is bad for agriculture and the overall environment. Some of the reasons that have led to land degradation in the country and Pune include over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation and poor irrigation practices."Ecologist Prakash Gole said measures were necessary to stop further degradation of land. Steps like land restoration and reduction of human and livestock influence were necessary to counter land degradation, he said.

The city has not recorded even half the rainfall that it receives during this time of the year.\u000a\u000aAgainst an average of 1,450mm of rainfall in the season, the city gets at least 600mm by July-end every year. This year none of the seven zones has received over 500mm mark.\u000a\u000aAn official of the Indian Meteorological Department said, "We are short by at least 200mm in the city. If the trends continue, there will a shortage by almost 500mm this year by October."\u000a\u000aProfessor Mahesh Desai of SVNIT said,"The city has become like an island. We are experiencing all weathers in a single day. On one side we have Ukai dam, at the other the sea and on the third side, the Narmada dam. Hence, the south-west clouds are coming to the region only as passing dignitaries."\u000a\u000aHe said, "Main clouds have just passed over the region without much rain this year. These are the effects of climate change and global warming."\u000a\u000aThe central zone has recorded 338mm, Varacha 203mm, Rander 425mm, Katargam 246mm, Udhna 187mm, Limbayat 175mm and Athwa 184mm of rainfall this season in the city.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.

VAs the multilateral climate negotiations flounder, fail or are wrenched back from the precipice in ever more creative ways every year, unilateral climate actions by impatient states are gaining ground. The most controversial of these is the extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to aviation, and its application to all airlines that land in or depart from EU airports.\u000a\u000aThis EU scheme subjects Jet Airways, for instance, which has a Brussels hub, to a cap on the total greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by its flights departing from or arriving in the EU. At the end of each accounting period Jet will be required to surrender GHG allowances to cover the GHGs emitted by such flights. It will be assigned 85 per cent of GHG allowances for free and be required to buy the rest at auction. Jet can trade allowances it does not use and buy allowances if it falls short. If Jet does not surrender sufficient allowances, it will be subject to a penalty of 100 euros per tonne of carbon. Failure to pay could result in a flying ban.\u000a\u000aIndia has characterised the EU scheme as a "unilateral trade measure" and threatened a WTO challenge. The scheme has drawn criticism from Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea and the US. There is a bipartisan bill pending in the US Congress to prohibit US carriers from participating in the scheme. A group of American airlines challenged this scheme in the high court of England and Wales, which has referred the case for a preliminary ruling to the European Court of Justice.\u000a\u000aUnderlying the thicket of political considerations is a set of intriguing legal issues. The EU can, in the exercise of its territorial jurisdiction, regulate GHG emissions in its territory/airspace. It can also, in the exercise of its nationality jurisdiction, regulate the GHG-emitting behaviour of all EU airlines, wherever their emissions may occur. It is questionable, however, whether the EU can regulate foreign airlines in relation to GHG emissions that occur in other states' territories/airspace and over the high seas. In seeking to do this, the EU scheme is arguably contrary to customary international law that privileges state sovereignty and restricts unilateral extra-territorial legislative action. It also runs counter to the Chicago Convention (on International Civil Aviation), 1944, that recognises the "complete and exclusive" sovereignty of states over their airspace.\u000a\u000a... contd.\u000a\u000aALSO READ The taper tigers\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VIndia has thwarted a move by rich countries to have a small group to decide uniform guidelines to implement climate change mitigation action review regime in each country. Instead, India convinced them that each country should submit its own version of guidelines for consideration at the next UN conference in Panama City in October.\u000a\u000aReview of climate change mitigation actions, is the hottest issue of climate negotiators of 195 nations. Europe and US have been insisting on a regime for analysis of domestic mitigation actions of emerging economies such as India and China for agreeing to any climate treaty, a move being resisted by the developing world.\u000a\u000aRich countries led by Europe, proposed at a meeting of a small informal group of climate negotiators in New Zealand last month that a sub-group should be constituted to finalise the guidelines to operationalise the verification regime.\u000a\u000aThe meeting was called to work on a draft for adoption at the next UN climate change conference of the 195 nations at Durban in November-December this year. The verification mechanism was a hotly debated issue at the meeting.\u000a\u000a"These draft guidelines would have become basis for further deliberations on the proposed verification regime. It would have become difficult to introduce new ideas," a government official said.\u000a\u000aThe move was first opposed by Saudi Arabia and then backed by India. Both the countries were of the view that such a sub-group will undermine the individuality of nations as legislative procedures in countries are different.\u000a\u000a"The executive cannot decide on a legal framework. It is (the) job of the legislative," said the official, saying the guidelines are a legal instrument to be approved by the Parliament.\u000a\u000aConvinced by the view put forth by India, the group decided that each country will submit its version of the guidelines for domestic review regime, called international consultation and analysis (ICA), before the next climate conference in Panama city.\u000a\u000aThe Environment ministry will work out the guidelines in consultation with key ministers such as Commerce and External Affairs and the Planning Commission. It is for the first time India is working on a paper for having guidelines for international review of its domestic climate change mitigation actions.\u000a\u000aRecently, US chief climate negotiator Todd Stern had urged Environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan to put in a mechanism to allow ICA of the domestic mitigation actions so that rich countries could evaluate how India is checking its emission growth. Natarajan was, however, non-committal and said that India will decide on the policy in consonance with its Constitutional framework, which allows domestic actions to be reviewed only by the Parliament. India is open to allow verification of mitigation action funded by rich countries.

VURAN: Rising sea levels and rapid soil erosion have landed at Mumbai's doorstep.If climate-change sceptics take a walk on the Uran beach , 50-odd km from Mumbai, they can witness the damage wreaked on the shores.Large tracts of wetland at Uran, which flamingoes used to throng, have now been reclaimed by the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and the land, which was once under water, has now been filled up with mud. In what could well be called a case of instance karma, the sea, as if in revenge, has been lashing the tiny strip of Uran beach with renewed vigour, eroding it. A survey of the beach reveals massive soil erosion, with roots of coconut trees exposed above the sand andsometreeseven uprooted.In a bidtosavetheir hamlet situated off the shores, the panchayat of Nagaon has now pooled in its meagre resources to line boulders along the beach. But deputy sarpanch Swapnil Mali believes that the government should do its bit to help them save the shoreline. "We have to face the onslaught of the swelling waves crashing on the shore,especially during the rains. If the government wants to reclaim the sea and develop the east side of Uran,it is its responsibility to protect us from erosion," he said, adding that the village would launch an agitation if their demand was not met.Mali claims that the gram panchayat has written to state authorities but has not received any reply. "Our fields are just 200 m from the beach," says Mali. So,if the implacable erosion continues, their agricultural tracts of lands will also be washed away by the sea. Even the ONGC plant was under threat. But state environment secretary Valsa Nair claimed not to have received any complaint from Uran. "I will send a team to inspect," she told TOI.The greens look at the scene as a futile battle against the sea that follows its own rules and it cannot be harnessed with mere boulders. "If reclamation is carried out on one side, the sea will take over from the other. There's no conquering thesea," says Stalin D, project director of Vanashakti, an NGO working in the field of conservation. He feels that erosion is allthe more accentuated by the continuous destruction of the natural barriers, such as mangroves and boulders cannot substitute for thesturdy treecover. "Because of the reclamation atUran,the ingress of sea water into creeks andlow-lying areashas been clogged, as a result of which the sea pushes against whatever land available," he said. Deepak Apte, head of Bombay Natural History Society's maritime conservation programme, said the sea had its own boundaries. "You cannot try to draw your boundaries along the sea," hesaid.Times ViewSoil erosion at Uran is a pointer to what the future holds for Mumbai. Government agencies - as well as people living near the coast-need to learn lessons from what's happening at Mumbai's doorstep. And the lessons need to be learnt fast; repeating the Uran mistakes in Mumbai's ecologically fragile zone can lead to an environmental disaster of unmanageable proportions. We need to understand that destruction of nature has a direct bearing on our lives.

VNEW DELHI: Ahead of the crucial ministerial level climate talks in South Africa, India has convinced the other three BASIC countries South Africa and China -- to endorse its stand on equity, intellectual property rights and green trade barriers.The BASIC countries approved the Indian proposals, which had taken some strong negotiations to be put back on the table in the UN climate talks despite resistance from the developed countries.The meeting of the BASIC ministers in Brazil was to be attended by environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan but she missed it owing to the Anna Hazare crisis on the domestic front. India was represented by its senior negotiators.At the last formal talks, India had taken the lead in putting back on agenda the discussions on equitable share of atmosphere, the need to cut intellectual property rights on green technologies and banning trade barriers advocated by developed countries using green indicators such as carbon footprints of products as trigger.The BASIC countries face a difficult time at Durban where the Europeans are expected to pound more pressure on emerging economies to formally agree to binding emission reduction targets in future.At the two-day meeting in Brazil, the BASIC countries backed the demand to keep Kyoto Protocol alive beyond its first phase which ends next year, but the four key emerging economies also discussed how far the developed countries are likely to go with their threat to withdraw from Kyoto Protocol unless emerging economies commit to hard targets to cut down greenhouse gases.They stated their position against the rich countries junking Kyoto Protocol claiming they were doing so to list their commitments under a new regime. "It is hardly conceivable that a country would leave the Kyoto Protocol to do more," their statement read. They said such a move smacked of reduced political will in developed countries to cut emissions.Armed with this, Natarajan would be now attending the ministerial round called by the hosts South Africa as a precursor to the super jamboree at the end of the year.

VInuit hunters fighting to continue their traditional lifestyle in the melting Arctic have turned to Colorado scientists for help. In the Arctic, cracks have opened unexpectedly in sea-ice routes the Inuit rely on to track polar bears, caribou and other animals. Each year, the ice melts earlier and freezes later, forcing a shift from dog sleds to boats that require costly fuel. Once-reliable predictions from village elders, based in part on touching and tasting sea ice, increasingly fail.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aToday the scientists, led by climate-modeling veteran Glen Liston, are installing a super-sensitive network of weather stations near an isolated community on Baffin Island in northeast Canada called Kangiqtugaapik (population 1,000). It is an $800,000 project, backed by the National Science Foundation, aimed at understanding environmental change from an Inuit perspective. The Inuit \u201cdon\u2019t talk much about how cold it is. They talk about the wind. It affects how they navigate,\u201d said Liston, 51, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aListon has devoted decades to studying how wind courses over rock and glaciers, developing intricate meteorological models of the polar world. He\u2019s passionate about traversing the earth\u2019s most frigid snowfields and fjords to collect data for honing his models. A colleague, geographer Shari Gearheard of the Boulder-based National Snow and Ice Data Centre, is posted at Kangiqtugaapik, coordinating sociological studies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThree stations in operation\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs part of the project, Inuit visit Colorado on cultural exchanges. Liston commutes from Colorado. Three weather stations installed so far gather wind speed, wind direction and other data in an effort to help navigate climate change. A fourth station is planned. The project also collects data from an Environment Canada station at the Kangiqtugaapik Airport. Inuit existence for centuries has revolved around hunting polar bears, narwhals, caribou and seals.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChildren are traditionally trained from when they are tots to read the weather. A new telephone hotline and website deliver latest readings in the Inuktitut language. The data is downloaded from satellites at Liston\u2019s Fort Collins lab, then routed through National Snow and Ice Data Center computers. \u201cEvery weekend, I check it out,\u201d said Joanna Qillaq, a woman\u2019s community group leader and addiction counsellor, whose family gathers berries from their cabin two hours from town. \u201cIf the weather\u2019s getting warmer and warmer, I know we are going to have problems. For the polar bears, maybe we\u2019ll have to hunt more\u201d to find them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aElders used to be able to say, with reasonable certainty, whether stormy winds at Kangiqtugaapik were masking calm conditions for hunting in fjords to the west, she said. \u201cNow the ice melts earlier. In spring, that makes it more difficult to move around,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fall, when we\u2019re supposed to have the ice, it doesn\u2019t freeze until the end of September or early October.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time the Inuit have had to adapt. Canada\u2019s government relocated the semi-nomadic hunters in the 1950s, forcing them into permanent settlements near airstrips, sending children to residential schools in cities. Keeping their language became a struggle, which is intensifying amid today\u2019s push for Arctic oil-and-gas development.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCanadian authorities\u2019 regulation of the number of bears and narwhals the Inuit can kill rankles leaders, who believe they know how to maintain healthy animal populations. Climate change is proving even trickier to navigate. \u201cPeople have observed that the weather changes more quickly,\u201d said Gearheard, one of four lead scientists on the project. \u201cHunters and those who live on the land are the most affected.\u201d For example, knowing whether winds will kick up waves, preventing docking in rocky fjords, is a day-to-day necessity, she said. \u201cThe biggest concern is that, if the changes continue, they make sure they have access to their food.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn annual sealift and flown-in foods often are unhealthy, she said. \u201cGetting that food (from hunting) is super important, not just for nutrition but for cultural reasons.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTo maintain the weather stations, Liston and a local crew cross sea ice and camp as far as 70 miles from Kangiqtugaapik. A polar bear bent a pole at one station, but all are working. The data help refine climate-modeling methods designed for wider use. Liston said he has enough data now to compare shifting patterns in the Arctic, where overall snow volume has increased, with patterns in Colorado \u2013 and eventually pinpoint shifts that may be relevant for ski areas.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do much good to know there\u2019s going to be more snow in Colorado. We need to know where that snow is going to be,\u201d Liston said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my modeling does \u2013 take it to a scale where it will be relevant to people.\u201d For now, Inuit leaders still are sliding out dog sleds, waiting for temperatures to drop. Some female polar bears spotted this summer had two cubs, locals observed, and unlike other areas in the Arctic the bears near Kangiqtugaapik appear abundant and plump.

VThe scale of Hurricane Irene,which could cause more extensive damage along the USs Eastern Seaboard than any storm in decades,is reviving an old question: are hurricanes getting worse because of human-induced climate change?\u000a\u000aThe short answer from scientists is that they are still trying to figure it out. But many of them do believe that hurricanes will get more intense as the planet warms,and they see large hurricanes like Irene as a harbinger.\u000a\u000aWhile the number of the most intense storms has clearly been rising since the 1970s,researchers have come to differing conclusions about whether that increase can be attributed to human activities. On a longer time scale,I think  but not all of my colleagues agree  that the evidence for a connection between Atlantic hurricanes and global climate change is fairly compelling, said Kerry Emanuel,an expert on the issue at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\u000a\u000aAmong those who disagree is Thomas R. Knutson,a federal researcher at the US governments Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton. The rising trend of recent decades occurred over too short a period to be sure it was not a consequence of natural variability,he said,and statistics from earlier years are not reliable enough to draw firm conclusions about any long-term trend in hurricane intensities.\u000a\u000aEveryone sort of agrees on this short-term trend,but then the agreement starts to break down when you go back longer-term, Knutson said. He argues,essentially,that Emanuels conclusion is premature,though he adds that evidence for a human impact on hurricanes could eventually be established.\u000a\u000aWhile scientists from both camps tend to think hurricanes are likely to intensify,they do not have great confidence in their ability to project the magnitude of that increase.\u000a\u000aOne climate-change projection,prepared by Knutsons group,is that the annual number of the most intense storms will double over the course of the 21st century. But what proportion of those would actually hit land is another murky issue. Scientists say climate change could alter steering currents or other traits of the atmosphere that influence hurricane behavior.\u000a\u000aStorms are one of natures ways of moving heat around,and high temperatures at the ocean surface tend to feed hurricanes and make them stronger. That appears to be a prime factor in explaining the power of Hurricane Irene,since temperatures in the Atlantic are well above their long-term average for this time of year.\u000a\u000aThe ocean has been getting warmer for decades,and most climate scientists say it is because greenhouse gases are trapping extra heat. Rising sea-surface temperatures are factored into both Knutsons and Emanuels analyses,but they disagree on the effect that warming in remote areas of the tropics will have on Atlantic hurricanes.\u000a\u000aAir temperatures are also rising because of greenhouse gases,scientists say. That causes land ice to melt,one of several factors leading to a rise in sea level. That increase,in turn,is making coastlines more vulnerable to damage from the storm surges that can accompany powerful hurricanes.\u000a\u000aOverall damage from hurricanes has skyrocketed in recent decades,but most experts agree that is mainly due to excessive development along vulnerable coastlines.\u000a\u000aIn a statement five years ago,Emanuel,Knutson and eight colleagues called this the main hurricane problem facing the United States, and they pleaded for a reassessment of policies that subsidise coastal development  a reassessment that has not happened.\u000a\u000aWe are optimistic that continued research will eventually resolve much of the current controversy over the effect of climate change on hurricanes, they wrote at the time. But the more urgent problem of our lemming-like march to the sea requires immediate and sustained attention. Justin Gills\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VAHMEDABAD: The world market for wind energy saw a sound revival in the first half of 2011 and re-gained momentum after a weak year in 2010. According to the estimates by the World Wind Energy Association WWEA ), the worldwide wind capacity reached 215000 MW by the end of June 2011, out of which 18,405 MW were added in the first six months of 2011.This increase represents 15 % more than in the first half of 2010, when only 16,000 MW were added. Major wind markets China, USA, Germany, Spain, and India continue to lead the show in capacity addition. They, together representing a total share of 74 % of the global wind capacity.The global wind capacity grew by 9,3 % within six months and by 22,9 % on an annual basis, mid-2011 compared with mid-2010. In comparison, the annual growth rate in 2010 was 23.6 %. In 2011 also, China continued to dominate the world wind market, adding 8 GW in only 6 months, the highest number ever within the first half-year.Within those 6 months, China accounted for 43 % of the world market for new wind turbines, compared with 50 % in the full year of 2010. By June 2011, China had an overall installed capacity of around 52 GW.WWEA estimates 240 GW of wind cover, almost 3 % of the worldwide electricity demand for end of the year 2011. In the second half of 2011, an additional capacity of 25,500 MW is expected to be erected worldwide, which would bring new annual installations to 43,900 MW, compared with 37,642 MW in the year 2010. The total installed wind capacity is projected to reach 2,40,500 MW by the end of this year.WWEA secretary general Stefan Gsnger said, "Although the deployment of the wind power worldwide is again speeding up, we still see relatively moderate growth rates, compared with previous years. On the one hand, it is very encouraging that new countries are coming up. On the other hand, we need more support on the national as well as on the international level. We hope that especially the UN climate change conference in Durban will lead to better frameworks for wind energy mainly in developing countries. Amongst the industrialised countries, we expect that Japan will play an active and positive role in wind power in the foreseeable future and join soon the group of leading wind countries."Most of the European markets showed stronger growth in 2011 than in the previous year: The top markets in Europe continue to be Germany with a new capacity of 766 MW and reaching a total of 27,981 MW, Spain (484 MW), Italy (460 MW), France (400 MW), the United Kingdom (504 MW) and Portugal (260 MW). In Europe, only France and Denmark showed a decrease in their new installed capacity compared to the first half of 2010 and Denmark even dropped out of the list of the top 10 markets, while Portugal became the new number 10.The US market added 2,252 MW between January and June 2011. However, it is questionable whether the US market can regain the strength it had in 2009 when a total capacity of almost 10 GW was installed within one year, read the WWEA statement. Relatively strong growth can be observed in Canada which installed 603 MW during the first half of 2011, with Ontario as the strongest province due to the ground-breaking Green Energy Act.Meanwhile, a number of new markets are arising around the world as three countries were added to the list of countries that are using wind energy, increasing the number from 83 to 86. Venezuela, Honduras, and Ethiopia are the new entrants. Also the Dominican Republic installed its first major wind farm and increased its capacity from 0.2 MW to 60.2 MW.Within Europe, again the emerging markets in Eastern Europe showed the highest growth from January to June 2011. Romania with 10 % growth (59 MW), Poland with 22 % (245 MW), Croatia with 28 % (20 MW) and Estonia with 32 % (48 MW) added new capacities. A number of countries introduced new and ambitious legislation for wind power, including Ecuador, Japan, Malaysia and Uganda, which adopted systems of feed-in tariffs for the development of renewable energy.

VNEW DELHI: The differences of opinion in the higher echelons of the government about India's international climate change stance has now come out in the open with a WikiLeaks cable showing senior leaders Jairam Ramesh , in his role as environment minister, and Montek Singh Ahluwalia , deputy chairman of Planning Commission , taking divergent views on climate change in their interactions with senior US officials.A cable recording a meeting of US special envoy on climate change Todd Stern with Ahluwalia in August 2009 records, " Deputy Planning Commissioner Montek Singh Ahluwalia told S/E Stern that the developing countries' rhetoric regarding historical responsibility was a negotiating tool and while India publicly projected that it had no intention of reducing emissions, it was putting in place measures to deploy wind and solar energy that would reduce its emissions from business as usual."It has been a long standing position of developing countries that developed countries, which have eaten up carbon space in the atmosphere, should pay up for the investments needed to solve the problem and vacate the space for developing worlds to eradicate poverty and grow.In a separate meeting in January 2010 after the contentious Copenhagen Accord, a cable records the then environment minister Jairam Ramesh telling the US ambassador that he did not agree with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's interpretation of the letters written by UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon and Danish PM Rasmussen insisting on legally binding emission commitments from India.The cable notes, "Ramesh stated that India is ready to 'carry its domestic commitments forward' and could send its mitigation actions to the UNFCCC 'within about two hours'." He claimed that letters from the UN secretary general and the Danish PM had "muddied the waters".Ramesh said these communications could be read to imply that the submissions under the accord were legally binding and that the accord might be seen as superseding the two-track negotiating process laid out under the Kyoto Protocol and Bali Roadmap. Prime Minister Singh had replied in a January 18 letter seeking clarification. Ramesh said he did not necessarily read the letters this way but, nonetheless, they had opened questions that the PM felt must be answered before the government of India could proceed. Ramesh said he expected a clarification from the UNFCCC, and had spoken to Yvo de Boer about it.After the PM's letter, the government took stance different from one Ramesh prescribed and supported the accord but subscribed its domestic targets with several conditions that ensured the accord did not immediately become operational.Prior to the Copenhagen accord that was signed in December 2009, the US special envoy had met Ramesh and Ahluwalia. The cable records that the then environment minister "Jairam Ramesh discussed the domestic politics of a Copenhagen agreement noting that as a politician, he had to sell the agreement to his constituency. He stated that the Indian system will find it infinitely easier to accept something legislated domestically than imposed internationally. Ramesh said he would look at legislating various mitigation plans found in India's National Action Plan on Climate Change in order to give them the force of law. S/E Stern welcomed the proposal and asked whether it would be possible to use executive regulation as opposed to legislation. Ramesh affirmed that while it was possible, legislation was necessary in order to gain credibility, because there is a sanctity to a law".

VNEW DELHI: The meeting was meant to review the work done two decades after the famed Rio summit or the UN meet on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But the Rio+20 conference is turning into another global ground to put green fetters on developing economies.A proposal floated in the run-up to the main meeting has suggested \u201csustainable development goals\u201d along the lines of millennium development goals. But the goals could turn into green chains on growth in emerging economies with goals like carbon emissions and fixed renewable energy content in energy mix being forced down in the name of sustainable development.The proposal mooted by Columbia in a recently concluded meeting in Brazil in the run-up to the big jamboree has stirred heated debate about new channels being found to break the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility\u201d and imposing common standards and targets for greening the economy across developed and developing world.While another meeting on the issue is slated to be held in China this month, a ministerial round to be hosted in Delhi will see the new \u201cgreen\u201d game play out more openly with India and other developing countries bringing forth counter proposals.The proposal from Columbia, which is likely to slowly see support from European countries in the coming days, could also take forward the attempts of the developed countries at the UN climate change convention. At the climate convention too, the developed countries have been fighting hard to break or redefine the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities to impose mandatory carbon cuts on emerging economies.At the Brazil meeting, India did put up a preliminary counter proposal pointing that sustainable development and poverty eradication were at the heart of the Rio summit and that they should remain the goals and other elements a via media only.India too had commissioned three studies from non-government agencies on the issue which are likely to be in soon. The government will have to take a call on these studies as well as green benchmarking or accounting of the economy which have raised some concerns. Any national level accounting of green parameters could lend itself to a global regime with standards and targets, they have warned even at the climate talks.

VBy now, most of us have nearly forgotten Irene, the hurricane that wasn't quite. We shouldn't.\u000a\u000aPerhaps the hurricane itself is not due to climate change, but data from blogs all over suggests the speed of the winds, the amount of rain and the intensity with which the waves hit were greater because of effects of climate change. When, just seven years ago, the film The Day After Tomorrow, was released, it showed snowfall in Delhi and devastating floods in New York. We laughed at this exaggeration.\u000a\u000aBut what seemed absurd in the near past is reality today. Perhaps the hurricane itself is not due to climate change, but data from blogs suggests the speed of the winds, the amount of rain and the intensity with which the waves hit are all greater than they would be otherwise.Let\u2019s take this seriously. India is expected to suffer many climate-based disasters. The government must learn from this scare and plan for climate change adaption in the 25% of the country\u2019s most vulnerable areas.\u000a\u000aThis means plan with communities, make resources available and share all the information transparently. In cities, it includes planning to absorb more migrants and basic living standards for everyone. The current budget was a cop-out as far as climate change goes.\u000a\u000aWatch out for the next budget, and see how serious the government is this time.\u000a\u000aChile\u2019s Green Irony\u000a\u000aRecently, I returned from Chile, a bit surprised.

Unfortunately, the smaller fish are used as feed for meat and chicken, the preferred food. Ironically, Chile is experiencing high rates of child obesity. Peruvians, with a similar fishing industry eat 3 times more fish than Chileans and face less of an obesity problem. Food apart, there is exercise. The civic infrastructure in Santiago, where a third of Chile\u2019s population lives, is also very pedestrian friendly.\u000a\u000aYet, you hardly see any school children walking or cycling, another solution for obesity.

VIndia made it clear today that it wanted extension of the current on emission cuts, but said it would not accept any further legally binding emission framework.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore we decide on a new legally binding framework,\u201d said environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan, \u201cit is important to ensure that the existing framework does not crumble. There is at present a legally binding framework (Kyoto Protocol). We want it to continue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statement comes ahead of the crucial to the climate change convention at Durban in December. So far, India has maintained that while it would make all efforts to cut back on green house gas emissions and even report about this to its own Parliament, these would be voluntary.\u000a\u000aThe country has also pledged to strive to reduce emissions intensity of India\u2019s GDP by 20-25 per cent by 2020 over 2005.\u000a\u000aNatarajan maintained that India had done voluntarily \u201cfar more than developed countries\u201d on the issue of carbon emission cuts, and sought to know from the developed nations about their efforts on this front \u201cbefore we talk about any other legally binding commitment.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 2005-enforced Kyoto Protocol, which requires developed countries to cut emissions, expires at the end of 2012. The Protocol, signed by 193 parties till now, is an international agreement linked to the (UNFCCC).\u000a\u000aIts major feature is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialised countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These amount to an average of five per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-12.\u000a\u000aNatarajan, briefing the media after attending the Informal Ministerial Consultations on Climate Change in South Africa\u2019s Pretoria, had said the continuation of the second commitment period of the would be a key deliverable in the upcoming climate change dialogue in Durban. The meeting in Pretoria comes ahead of the climate change talks in Durban in December.\u000a\u000aCountries are still divided on several issues ahead of the meeting to try and create a new mechanism to succeed the Clearing India\u2019s stand, Natarajan said, \u201cAs a developing country, India has already taken substantial and ambitious actions at great cost.

VNEW DELHI: India took a long step back into the developing world camp and towards its original international stance with Union environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan demanding much greater commitment from the developed countries before India even begins to discuss a legally binding agreement on climate change . She was speaking at a two-day informal ministerial gathering at Pretoria, South Africa, ahead of the full-blown negotiations in Durban in December.She demanded that equity be put at the heart of the climate negotiations and that rich countries first commit to addressing their historical responsibility before asking anything more of emerging economies like India, indicating that Jairam Ramesh 's 'flexibility' era was over.For India, this was a radical move away from the approach Natarajan's predecessor had taken in his tenure as environment minister.Ramesh had agreed to begin discussions on a legally binding deal. In contrast, Natarajan took a stand that got the support of other developing countries as well. "At this stage, we do not have to discuss the nature of a legally binding agreement," she said in her statement that sources said had the developed countries irked and the developing countries collectively in support.India's stand under Ramesh had shifted steadily in agreeing to an international climate deal that moved away from the existing terms of negotiations. The existing convention and international agreements squarely put the responsibility on the developed countries to be the first and substantial movers on reducing emissions. Over two years \u2013 at Copenhagen and Cancun \u2013 Ramesh had taken the lead to accept mutations that would ultimately alter the balance and bring a regime where emerging economies would take on binding commitments as well."Stabilisation of climate is based on the actions that are taken to reduce the stock of emissions. We cannot avoid this historical fact even if it may not be palatable to some of us," Natarajan said taking a shot at countries like US that have balked at the talk of carbon space and its equitable distribution.Sources told TOI that when the US special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern, used Jairam Ramesh's earlier statements to counter India's position, Natarajan deftly handled the moment stating, "Let me now turn to the remarks of my predecessor who was just quoted. When he talked of a domestically legally binding framework of actions, Minister Ramesh did so in the context of balanced and comprehensive outcomes in the two-track process. In the current scenario, I do not see the assurance of a balance." To cut the jargon, she 're-interpreted' Ramesh to say that without strong emission reduction targets by developed countries on Kyoto Protocol, progress could not be made on an over-arching deal where emerging economies take on greater responsibility of a legally binding nature.This statement came amidst the Europeans wondering aloud what was the advantage of continuing with Kyoto Protocol if some rich countries wanted out and the US demanding a new deal regardless by December 2011."As a developing country, India has already taken substantial and ambitious actions at great cost. However, in the above scenario that I just described (where rich countries are not doing enough), the issue of a legally binding agreement has acquired huge political sensitivities in India. I am guided by a political consensus in my country," Natarajan told the gathering.She added, "Equity is more fundamental and needs to be brought into our discourse to define the frame within which the global peaking (of emissions) is addressed, the equitable access to sustainable development is ensured and the nature of outcomes is determined."With threats from developed countries that talks at Durban in December could fail unless emerging economies start discussing their legally binding commitments, Natarajan countered by stating, "In our anxiety to rush towards Durban outcomes therefore, we should avoid putting the cart before the horse," implying that India was not keen upon talks on a legally binding deal even before it was known what the developed countries were bringing to table.She bolstered her argument saying, "There can be no guarantee of effective stabilization unless the developed country parties who have the largest share of historical stock of emissions agree to reach their peak. In the absence of a time frame for Annex-I peaking, any talk of global peak will remain a pious wish."At another occasion in the two-day meeting, the minister reiterated that India was doing more than its fair bit already on climate change and said, "Voluntary actions that India has announced are a part of our development strategy. But, all these actions cost a tremendous amount of resources. We are in the process of assessing the costs of implementing this strategy. It is fundamental that the global mechanisms should help in providing resources (for this strategy)."

VAfter showing flexibility for over two years India has toughened its stand on climate issues, refusing any verification regime for voluntary climate actions and seeking a re-look at Cancun agreements to include equity as an \u201cessential\u201d parameter for further talks and extension of Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFormer environment minister Jairam Ramesh had shown flexibility but the new minister Jayanthi Natarajan abandoned the soft approach after her first meeting on climate change issues with 150 environment ministers in South Africa.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cTalks are a continuous process,\u201d Natarajan said, when asked whether there would be an agreement at the next conference of 195 countries in Durban, South Africa later this year. \u201cOur position is clear that we want second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA big change in India\u2019s flexible approach was related to review of voluntary emission control measures, known as international consultation and analysis (ICA), born on behest of India and China in Copenhagen in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aICA is the proposed transparency mechanism for the voluntary climate actions by the developing countries whereas International Assessment and Review (IAR) is a similar mechanism for binding emission cuts for the rich nations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not accepting ICA in the present form as it is too intrusive,\u201d said environment secretary T Chatterjee. This comes after US climate negotiator Todd Stern met Natarajan and spelt out that ICA would mean review of environmental aspects in domestic policies. \u201cWe cannot allow such a thing\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNatarajan, who met over 150 environment ministers in Pretoria, South Africa, said India took a significant step ahead at Cancun climate talks in 2010 by agreeing to internationalising its voluntary domestic actions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was important flexibility shown by us to contribute to a level of confidence and trust in the process,\u201d she said. For future, the minister made it clear the rich countries should provide \u201cadditional financial resources to the developing countries to address climate change\u201d through voluntary actions. Providing financial resources is a binding committee for the developed world under the climate framework convention.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia has also proposed three agenda items ---- equity, trade and technology related to Intellectual Property Rights ---- for the Durban climate conference.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNatarajan also showed her unhappiness with Cancun agreements, for which Ramesh had received praise of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said some issues related to Bali Roadmap, which had been left out from the Cancun agreements, will have to be brought back to the negotiating table.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe European Union and United States may find Natarajan stiffer than her predecessor as she had made it clear that it is time for development world to pay for historical emissions rather than seek concessions from the developing world.

VWASHINGTON: Climate change may be worse for the lungs, as ozone pollution-related deaths are likely to increase in certain regions in the next 60 years, scientists have warned.Researchers have predicted that certain countries such as Belgium, France, Spain and Portugal may witness an increase in ozone pollution deaths between 10 and 14 per cent during the period.However, Nordic and Baltic countries are expected to see a drop in such deaths, they said at the European Respiratory Society's Annual Congress in Amsterdam, LiveScience reported.Ozone is a two-faced gas. High in the stratosphere, it forms a protective layer that blocks ultraviolet radiation, which is potentially harmful to life, keeping it from reaching the surface of the planet.This happens at roughly 12.4 miles (20 km) above the Earth's surface. Closer to the surface of the planet, ozone is a pollutant that can act as a greenhouse gas, trapping energy and warming the planet.Breathing ozone can also cause health problems, including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation and congestion, said the researchers.It can aggravate conditions like bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma, as well as reduce lung function and inflame the linings of the lungs, and repeated exposure to ozone may permanently scar lung tissue, they said.The researchers led by Bertil Forsberg at Umea University of Sweden made the ozone-related death projections as part of work the Climate-TRAP project to prepare for the changing public health needs expected to accompany human-caused climate change.They used two emissions scenarios -- one for high growth, the other moderate -- and two climate models to simulate how future ozone levels would be affected by climate change.The researchers compared four periods, the baseline period 1961 to 1990, the current situation 1990 to 2009,near future 2021 to 2050 and further future 2041 to 2060.When comparing the baseline period with the current situation, they found the largest increase in ozone-related deaths, of less than 4 per cent, occurred in Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands and the UK.Comparing the baseline period and the further future, the biggest increase, of 10-14 per cent, was projected in Belgium, France, Spain and Portugal. However, Nordic and Baltic countries may see a 10 to 14 per cent drop in ozone-related deaths, they found.According to the researchers, ozone pollution forms when sunlight acts on certain chemicals, including nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.Rise in temperature can increase these photochemical reactions, so warmer days correlate with higher ozone levels. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty in predicting how climate change will affect ozone levels, they added.

VWASHINGTON: A US agency has announced to provide a financial assistance of USD 150 million to India to expand use of solar powered telecommunication towers The decision by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC ) is expected to reduce CO2 emissions and create jobs in both the US and India."This project brings OPIC's financing for renewable energy in India to more than USD 400 million approved in just the past year," said OPIC President and CEO Elizabeth Littlefield."OPIC is proud to be supporting India's impressive ambitions to shift to a less carbon-intensive economy," Littlefield added.Together with project sponsor Applied Solar Technologies (AST), tower companies in India are working to reduce their dependence on site-situated diesel powered generator sets, in part because tower operators in remote areas lack access to the electrical grid, OPIC said in a statement.The potential for higher fuel prices and mounting pressure to reduce CO2 emissions make the shift to renewable energy an important priority for the tower companies and cell operators generally.In recognition of their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, AST's two largest customers won prestigious awards for their focus on more sustainable operations.AST will use the OPIC loan to supplement cellular towers' diesel-powered generators with solar hybrid energy systems that use proprietary controllers to integrate and optimise usage through photovoltaic technology, electricity from the electric grid, a battery bank charged by solar panels, and existing generators, the statement said.The US sponsors of the project are Vinod Agarwal; Bessemer Venture Partners Trust , a subsidiary of California-based Bessemer Venture Partners, which manages more than USD 2 billion of venture capital invested in more than 130 companies worldwide; and Capricorn Libra Investment Group, a subsidiary of Capricorn Investment Group, LLC, also a California-based company that invests in companies manufacturing environmentally-friendly products.

VCompact fluorescent lamp (CFL) or green lamp popular for being energy efficient is not as environment and health-friendly as the government claims owing to its higher mercury content, revealed a study.\u000a\u000aThe average mercury content in CFLs sold in Indian market is 21 mg per lamp as compared to global best of three to four mg, the study released on Thursday by NGO Toxic Link said.\u000a\u000aHigher mercury content poses greater risk to vital organs such as liver and it can cause neurological problems to pregnant women and children. This happens only if a lamp is damaged and comes in direct contact with heavy metals.\u000a\u000aCFLs has been promoted in a bid to check rising carbon emissions as they are 40% more energy efficient than incandescent lamps.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the CFL market in India is growing at an annual rate of 36% with the government's Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) promoting it by selling at highly subsidised rates. The BEE's Bachat Lamp Yojana is registered with the UN's carbon offsetting scheme.\u000a\u000aRavi Aggarwal, the director of Toxic Link, said the study has revealed that the Central Pollution Control Board's claim in 2008 that CFLs contains 3-12 mg of mercury is not fully correct.\u000a\u000aMercury content in the lamps of four leading brands ranges between 2.27 mg and 62.56 mg, the study said. "It is free for all as there were no standards set on mercury in CFLs in India," Aggarwal said.\u000a\u000aEven safe disposal of CFLs is still an issue with the environment ministry not including the lamps under the electronic waste management and disposal rules.

VBelieve it or not, the humble earthworm has become the latest secret weapon in the war against climate change.\u000a\u000aA major four-year-old study has revealed that instead of just wriggling around and providing food for birds, earthworms -- have been burrowing their way through the ground for 300 million years -- can help prevent flooding and droughts.\u000a\u000aFloods and droughts are caused by cycles of dry weather and monsoon-type rains often said to be caused by global warming. And this is where the humble earthworm can help the planet, say researchers at the Game and Wildlife Conservation Society in the UK.\u000a\u000aThe average worm weighs less than half an ounce but it is able to eat through a third of its own weight in soil a day. When worms tunnel the soil absorbs more water, meaning that in their millions, worms can turn the ground into one vast sponge soaking up water in floods but retaining it during dry spells.\u000a\u000aNow, farmers can play a vital part in combating the devastation caused by floods and droughts by encouraging earthworms, according to the researchers.\u000a\u000a"Our research shows that farmers can make a huge difference in helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. When fields are not ploughed, the soil condition is improved naturally by the tunnelling of earthworms, which absorb water at a rate of four to 10 times that of fields which are without worm tunnels.\u000a\u000a"This in turn helps the soil to take up water during storms and to retain it during drought. It also helped to buffer our stream from flooding during heavy rain," the 'Sunday Express' quoted Dr Chris Stoate, head of research at the society's Allerton Project farm, as saying.

VSpeaking on the theme \u2018Cities and Climate Change\u2019 on Monday, Urban Designer and Planner and adjunct faculty at RV School of Architecture Brinda Sastry said it was imperative to concentrate on making cities resilient. Incidently, it is also the theme of World Habitat Day on Monday.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe UN General Assembly designated the first Monday of October every year as World Habitat Day. The idea was to reflect on the state of our towns and cities and the basic right of all to adequate shelter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile cities occupy only two per cent of the surface area, they are responsible for 75 per cent of energy consumption and 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d she said. To combat this, the cities need to be planned in a sustainable and green way, which can be done by sharing knowledge between government, city planners, civil societies and scientific communities.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOne of the examples in making a resilient city is the change in land use pattern. Concentrating and preserving natural environment will help mitigate problems of deforestation for agriculture or construction activities.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cLand use patterns will be important factors in determining the emissions from the cities. Designing multi-transport roads and using building materials that are renewable would go a long way in reducing carbon emission in the long run, Sastry said. India is the second most vulnerable country to climate change, as per the study conducted by Maplecroft, UK-based risk advisory company.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHousing issue for poor\u000a\u000aThe International Co-operation Division of BMS Education Trust in collaboration with UN Habitat organised a seminar on the occasion of World Habitat Day. Sate Housing Department, Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Co-operation Limited and Karnataka Slum Development Board participated in the seminar.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aProf Dr Ing H R Viswanath, executive chairman, International Co-operation Division, BMS Education Trust, drew attention to the theme - Cities and Climate Change \u2013 which had become a prominent development challenge of the 21st century.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Dr P Dayananda Pai, trustee, BMS Education Trust, said, \u201cThe problem of housing in cities was due to migration, which was the result of lack of employment opportunity in rural areas.\u201d Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Co-operation Limited said that the target for this year was construction of 4.8 lakh houses Managing Director Mahadev Prasad said under the \u2018Aasare\u2019 scheme, it had constructed 15,000 houses and had set a target of 55,000 in coming financial year.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aConsultation\u000a\u000aThe Indo Global Social Service Society (IGSSS) in collaboration with Forum of Karnataka for the City-Makers organised a consultation-cum-discussion on city-makers (homeless citizens) on the occasion of World Habitat Day.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Programme Officer of IGSSS Rajani Srikakulam highlighted the state of urban homeless, who live in dehumanising conditions without adequate access to food security, water, sanitation, health, legal identity and livelihoods due to meagre income they earn.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUrban homeless includes vegetable vendors, domestic servants, sanitation workers, head loaders, rag-pickers and construction labourers, etc, who contribute to the City\u2019s development but yet remain invisible to the society. She said these people are deprived of all basic fundamental rights and lack of access to any of the welfare schemes of the government in absence of a shelter and a proper address.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aShivabasavaiah, the joint commissioner of Bommanahalli zone, BBMP said his zonal officers had identified buildings for the night shelter of the urban homeless. They also had organised a health camp for them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aClifton D Rozario, State adviser to Supreme Court Commissioner on Right to Food said the Supreme Court had proclaimed an order on all the State governments to construct shelter/homes in cities with more than 5 lakh population.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VAfter failing to save Kyoto Protocol, India is fighting to include protection differentiated responsibility enshrined in the protocol in the proposed climate treaty to defeat the call of the rich countries of having mandatory emission reduction target for all nations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAustralia and Norway have proposed a new agreement seeking emission reduction targets for all countries on basis of their global warming causing carbon dioxide emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThey have set a target of 2015 to make the agreement operational. The proposal calls on major economies to quickly strengthen steps to curb emissions, agree on a way to standardise actions and a system to compare and verify what everyone else is doing.\u000a\u000aThe proposal was opposed by India this week at the United Nations climate talks in Panama City on the ground that the bid of the historical polluters, the rich nations, to have one emission reduction regime for all was not acceptable.\u000a\u000a"They (rich nations) cannot ask the recent emitters like India and China to take on the responsibility of cutting emissions," said an Indiannegotiator, while outlining country's position on the issue.\u000a\u000aInstead, India had urged the UN body of 195 nations to adopt a new climate agreement which have basic tenements of the Kyoto Protocol --- mandatory emission reduction target for the rich nations and voluntary emission control measures for the developing world.\u000a\u000aThere will be a lot of difficulty in getting the Indian proposal through at the conference of 195 nations with other many developing countries are not willing to support India fully.\u000a\u000aThere is a division in G-77 plus China, the most powerful group in UN climate talks, with several African countries seeking some emission reduction target for the emerging economies.\u000a\u000aEven South Africa, which is part of the Basic group of India, China and Brazil, is not openly supporting India as it wants to be seen as a country leading the cause of Africa in climate talks.\u000a\u000aUnlike the divided developed world, the rich nations are united in seeking a uniform climate treaty. The European Union had again changed its goalpost and is towing the line of United States and Australia, the two nations which did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aTill now the European Union has not debunked Kyoto Protocol but at Panama City they openly supported the Australian-Norway proposal, which also has backing of other rich nations such as Canada and Japan.\u000a\u000aTheir aim is to check economic growth of emerging economies such as India and China through emissions regulations under the UN climate convention.

VParis: Amid pressure to lower oil subsidy, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday ruled out removal of government support citing volatile fuel prices.While reiterating India\u2019s commitment to phasing out fuel subsidy, Mukherjee made it clear the government will adopt a \u201cno one-size-fitsall approach to reform the subsidy regime\u201d .Pointing to the steps taken to deregulate petrol prices and hike diesel prices, the finance minister highlighted efforts related to direct subsidy transfer. \u201cEven as we remain committed to reduce inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the use of fuels, such as LPG and kerosene, for domestic purposes cannot be easily phased out in the near future. We need to ensure sustainable energy security for the poor, which would take time,\u201d he said during a session on energy subsidy.The issue has emerged as a key area of discussion as the civil society is demanding that the West undertake steps to address the issue of higher carbon emission.Mukherjee, however, said completely reducing fuel subsidies is not an option for most developing countries \u201cin the absence of reliable renewable energy\u201d .India against carbon tax to save climateIndia on Saturday strongly opposed imposition of carbon tax as an additional source of funding to fight climate change. \u201cIndia believes that some of the measures like carbon export optimization tax and levy on CDM/offsets violate the principles of the UN convention as their incidence falls entirely on developing countries and these cannot be recognized as a source of additional finance for climate change,\u201d finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said at the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meet on development, climate and innovative financing.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aFrom the mighty polar bear to the tiny house sparrow, many of earth\u2019s species appear to be shrinking in size, a new study reports and its authors think that\u2019s probably due to global warming.\u000a\u000aBut other experts say that conclusion goes too far, blaming global warming for what may be natural changes.\u000a\u000aThe new research was published online on Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change. It\u2019s based on a review of other studies and found that 38 of 85 animal and plant species showed a documented reduction in size over decades, including a type of Scottish sheep that is 5 per cent smaller than in 1985. Those studies looked at species over different time periods and in varying numbers.\u000a\u000aThe shrinking victims, according to the study, include cotton, corn, strawberries, bay scallops, shrimp, crayfish, carp, Atlantic salmon, herring, frogs, toads, iguanas, hooded robins, red-billed gulls, California squirrels, lynx and wood rats.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, Scottish researchers made news with the shrinking sheep study. Several studies have shown that polar bears, which rely on sea ice during the summer, also are not as big. And this latest study said the house sparrow\u2019s weight has dropped by one-seventh from 1950 to 1990. A bird called the graceful warbler showed a 26 per cent weight drop during the same time period.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a trend in a number of organisms across the board from plants to big vertebrates getting smaller,\u201d said study co-author Jennifer Sheridan, a biology researcher at the University of Alabama. \u201cThe theory is as things get warmer they don\u2019t need to grow as large.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost of these animals are cold-blooded, so the warmer the weather the faster their metabolism is and the more calories they burn, Sheridan said. There\u2019s a biological law, called Bergmann\u2019s rule that says that as it gets colder, animals get bigger.\u000a\u000aThis is the unwritten flip side of it, she said.\u000a\u000aBut Yoram Yom-Tov, a zoologist at Tel Aviv University whose studies Sheridan used in her research, said many species are shrinking, and you can\u2019t blame global warming exclusively.\u000a\u000a\u201cChanges in body size are a normal phenomenon,\u201d Yom-Tov wrote in an email. \u201cWhen conditions are favourable, they increase in size or reproduce at higher rates, and when conditions are deteriorating, they do the opposite. I think that most species will adapt to climate change and survive. No need for alarm.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd Stanford biologist Terry Root, an expert in climate change, said the study\u2019s conclusions \u201cseem kind of far-fetched.\u201d

VClimate change negotiations are with us again, this time in Durban following the high-level meetings in (2010) and (2009). The aim is to agree on a regime to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (particularly CO2) post-2012, when the present commitments under the run out.\u000a\u000aClimate change and global warming are important issues for India. Agriculture, which provides a livelihood for two-thirds of our population, is heavily dependent on the monsoons. Any disruptions to the monsoons due to global warming could jeopardise the livelihoods of millions. We also have a long coast line, vulnerable to rising sea levels \u2014 another likely consequence of global warming.\u000a\u000aThe calls on industrialised and transition countries (Annex I countries) to make \u2018legally binding\u2019 commitments to reduce GHG emissions, while China and the developing countries have been asked for only voluntary action. But the US never ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a serious weakness in its coverage. Apart from this distinction between legally binding and voluntary commitments, India has long emphasised the concept of equity and historical responsibility of industrialised countries in causing global warming.\u000a\u000aBut the latter argue that whatever the history might be, today China is the world\u2019s largest emitter of (over 23 per cent of the total). Other emerging countries have also become significant emitters of So a climate treaty that gives China a free pass is not going to be acceptable.\u000a\u000aThe basic problem with Kyoto is that Annex I countries account for less than 30 per cent of global emissions. Obviously, you cannot address the problem of global warming if you deal with less than 30 per cent of the problem. Not surprisingly, many Annex I countries, including Russia, have said that they will not make new commitments under Kyoto in these circumstances. So, merely insisting on Kyoto is likely to lead to a dead-end at Durban.\u000a\u000aAll this presents India\u2019s negotiators with a dilemma, particularly since developing countries are not quite united on climate change issues. The previous environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, noted at last December that \u201cthere are more and more developing countries asking questions of India\u201d regarding our refusal to accept commitments. The 41 small island developing states (SIDSs) as well as the least developed countries (LDCs) are deeply worried by climate change. For them, a new climate change agreement is a win-win \u2014 no obligations and hopefully, significant new \u2018green\u2019 financing. So, they will be very unhappy at failure in Durban and will blame anyone who seems to be the stumbling block.\u000a\u000aAs Kyoto addresses only a small part of global CO2 emissions, to achieve any impact, Kyoto will have to be complemented with an agreement that includes China, the US and other major CO2 emitters. Over the last two years Ramesh had started to explore some new approaches, suggesting voluntary but verifiable commitments. This approach could provide a basis for a complementary agreement. Recently however, we seemed to have backed away from these ideas. Some don\u2019t like \u201cverification\u201d. But would it not be in our own interest if the voluntary commitments of, say, China, with its notorious official figures, were verified?\u000a\u000aBut you might ask: doesn\u2019t India need to increase its CO2 emissions substantially to maintain economic growth? Well, according to 2006 figures, India produced GDP worth $579 per tonne of CO2 emissions. The US, which is not especially energy efficient, produced $2,291 \u2014 four times as much as India, France more than 10 times, while the EU as a whole, 6.4 times. So, if over the next 20 years we could increase our energy efficiency to the present US level, we could almost quadruple our GDP without increasing our CO2 emissions. In fact, we should aim to do better than the US, with its gas-guzzling cars!\u000a\u000aIn any case, we must increase our efficiency in the use of fossil fuels. We simply cannot be internationally competitive in the years ahead if we require four or six times more oil, gas and coal (much of which will have to be imported) per unit of output. And if we are going to limit our CO2 emissions for reasons of efficiency, would it not make sense to multiply the impact of our own national effort through a wider agreement to complement Kyoto?\u000a\u000aOne other issue of significance is that of maintaining the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). India is the second largest beneficiary, after China, of funding \u2014 Indian entities could potentially receive up to $5 billion through the over the next few years. Worth having!\u000a\u000aA last point. India is not likely to receive any money from new bilateral ODA (overseas development assistance) to combat climate change. So, while calling on industrialised countries to fulfill their Copenhagen/ pledges to provide additional financing, we could make a virtue of necessity by declaring that such ODA-based financing for climate change should only go to and In the end, even with voluntary but verifiable commitments on the table, there may still be no progress in Durban, given the lack of will in many industrialised countries \u2014 especially the US \u2014 in today\u2019s economic climate.\u000a\u000aBut even so, we may have some gains. The and will be happy at India's unselfish willingness to fight for their cause. China will have to do its own battles without India providing it cover. And industrialised countries will not be able to hide their own failures behind the so-called \u2018obstructionism\u2019 of India. And who knows we might even get a meaningful agreement, perhaps not at Durban but further down the road.

VAfter getting the Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development Project registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),Himachal Pradesh has become the first state in India to implement the clean development mechanism (CDM) project. Under the project,worlds largest,the World Bank will buy carbon credits from the new forests being developed on degraded lands.\u000a\u000aWith the granting of approval by the UNFCCC,the state may get an additional annual revenue of Rs 8-10 crore through carbon credits.\u000a\u000aThe project,in the public sector and spread over an area of 4,004 hectares surpasses a 3,500-hectare CDM project of China,would involve direct benefit to the villagers who would raise the plantations.\u000a\u000aR K Kapoor,the chief project director of the Rs 337-crore Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development Project said,The Ministry of Rural Development has adopted this project as a model for replicating it in other parts of the country. I have been invited by the ministry to make a presentation as to how Himachal Pradesh has achieved this. A few more ministries are keen to replicate Himachal Pradeshs initiative.\u000a\u000aChief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal,too,is ecstatic. World Banks Hurber Nove Josserand,(deputy country director) who was present to sign the agreement with state government had said that the Himachals project was innovative and would make it first state in India to achieve what most countries have failed to do. There is a need to support the project to help state become carbon neutral, Dhumal added.\u000a\u000aFor the records,Himachal Pradesh is aiming to become the countrys first carbon-free state and the worlds second and as a part of the endeavour,the state government has mandated all its departments to begin environment audit from this year.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile,the broad objective of the CDM project is to sequester greenhouse gases by expanding forestry plantations on mostly degraded lands apart from creating a carbon sink. The project aims to sequester 828,016 tonnes of carbon by the year 2026. One tonne of carbon dioxide converted into biomass under new plantations is counted as one credit.\u000a\u000aSpread over 11 watershed divisions in 177 gram panchayats across 10 districts under the watershed project,the CDM agreement with the World bank is estimated to fetch a carbon revenue of at least Rs 20 crore for the first crediting period of 20 years.\u000a\u000aThe carbon revenues have been calculated at a modest US $5 per tonne of carbon dioxide accumulated in tree biomass,above as well as under the ground.\u000a\u000aUnder this agreement,benefit accruing to the community and private landholders will be about Rs 2,500 per hectare,depending on growth of trees and other factors.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App

VNEW DELHI: The contentious issue of finance will be among the key items that will take centrestage at the UN-sponsored climate talks in Durban. Predictable and continuous funding to undertake steps to tackle climate change lies at the core of a balanced global deal.At the pre-conference meeting, South Africa said that the Durban meet should go beyond operationalising the Green Climate Fund agreed on at the Cancun meet. Pretoria indicated that the UN meet should take up \u201cthe very contentious issue of finance\u201d. This will be a tough political decision because of economic recession that impacted the industrialised countries.India maintains that developing countries can\u2019t be asked to shoulder the burden of providing funds. New Delhi and other developing countries stress that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, on which the UN convention is based, cannot be blurred. Developed nations are required to provide finances to the developing countries. South Africa\u2019s stress on \u201cmultilateralism, environmental integrity, fairness\u201d will mean bringing the discussion back into the UN-sponsored framework. Till now, most of the discussion on financing has been outside the framework of the UNFCCC The high-level advisory group on finance, appointed by the United Nations Secretary General, to look into the question of sources of long-term finance provided a variety of sources without ranking them or indicating preferences. While there has been little discussion within the UNFCCC on the issue, the G-20 has attempted to step in. The G-20 is of the view that the UNFCCC is \u201cnot the relevant forum\u201d to discuss long-term finance and that an efficient track was required to follow up on long-term finances, to ensure that the climate fund doesn\u2019t end up becoming an empty shell.The G-20 has asked the World Bank, the IMF and Bill Gates to provide a report on the issue. While the World Bank is looking into instruments of multilateral development banks, private finance and carbon financing, the IMF is concentrating on international public sourcing, especially bunkers and domestic carbon-related sources of finance.The Bill Gates report deals with innovative financing. India, and other G-77 countries have stressed that developing countries would need to be compensated if the distinction between developed and developing countries could not be made while making the levy.Speaking at the recent G-20 meet, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said \u201cinternational levies on shipping and aviation emissions should be included in the list of possible options for revenue raising only if a mechanism for refund of the revenues collected from developing countries is instituted and the collections refunded to developing countries\u201d.Discussions on the sources can be expected to include the financial transaction tax. In late August, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso proposed a levy on certain kinds of financial activities and will be applicable on transactions where at least one party is located within the European Union . Although the EU is yet to present the financial transaction tax (FTT) as a source for climate funds, but given its potential to generate fresh funds, it has been considered by the UN Advisory Group on Finance, and by the G-20 as a source for long-term climate financing. India, Brazil and South Africa argue that the FTT shifts the onus of providing climate finance to the developing world.Acknowledging the importance of the question of finance, South Africa\u2019s minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said \u201cThere was general agreement that sustained scaled up financing remains one of the core elements of a balanced, fair and credible outcome in Durban.\u201d

VNew Delhi: Developing countries have pledged greater levels of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions than the rich nations despite the developed world being responsible for a large part of the historical emissions.This conclusion by the Stockholm Environment Institute has stirred debate about how far India would now be willing to go with the US and Europe lagging behind on substantial actions to prevent climate change but asking for greater commitments from the developing world.\u201cThere is broad agreement that developing country pledges amount to more mitigation than developed country pledges,\u201d a report by the institute said.Countries provided these pledges under the Copenhagen Accord with developing countries such as India pledging to take actions to reduce emissions voluntarily despite not being required to do so under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.The SEI report is based on four detailed studies from different reputed institutions including UNEP and McKinsey and Company.The four independent studies used different parameters and assumptions to bring the different kinds of pledges into a comparable format and all four came to the same conclusion though the difference between promised goals of the rich and developing countries varied.The authors of the SEI report concluded that unless the UN accounting system shut the loopholes, the rich countries would be able to meet their pledges \u201cwith very little actual mitigation, and possibly with none at all\u201d.It also noted that the rich countries had not decoupled their consumption patterns from emissions but rather they had shifted many of those emissions to developing countries. In other words, the fossil-fuel driven consumption levels of the rich countries have not reduced over time and the actions taken by them to reduce emissions have been only those which brought net-benefit to their economies.The report said the developed countries held three-quarters of the world\u2019s GDP and were responsible for 75% of the historical emissions. \u201cIt seems self-evident that the developed world should take responsibility for much more mitigation effort than the developing world, and that this effort must have both a domestic and an international dimension,\u201d it said.\u201cThe developed world must raise their level of ambition to the levels demanded by science and equity. And, of course, they must fulfill those ambitions through actual mitigation, not through accounting loopholes,\u201d it added.The report noted that even after the rich countries agreed to do so, it would still require actions by the developing world to prevent dangerous climate change.

VThe government is faced with an unusual request from its own member of Parliament \u2014 Shashi Tharoor. He wants the government to declare January 12 as National No Meat Day. It has created a debate within the government on whether it should make such a pronouncement or not.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTharoor\u2019s claim that being vegetarian can help fight against climate change has arguments both in favour and against it.\u000a\u000aThose in favour say that every year animal agriculture produces more than 100 million tonnes of methane, which has 21 times more potential of causing global warming than carbon dioxide. Meat consumption has increased by over 50% in the last few decades, making it the highest human related cause for climate change.\u000a\u000aBut, the argument against turning vegetarian is that it would create an imbalance between human and animal presence leading to more methane emission than before. A World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report in 2010 said that meat substitutes are highly processed, often requiring large amounts of energy to produce, leading to higher emission of global warming causes gases.\u000a\u000aTharoor, who was former minister of state for external affairs, believes that turning vegetarian like him is good for environment and has urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to declare January 12 as No Meat Day to promote vegetarianism.\u000a\u000aEnvironment ministry is not adverse to declaring no meat day for two reasons. Firstly, it can showcase India\u2019s positive approach towards climate change and secondly, it promotes ministry\u2019s objective of promoting animal welfare.\u000a\u000aBut, the bigger question will have to be answered by agriculture ministry, which promotes poultry in a big way.

VNEW DELHI: Environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan notched a victory at the BASIC talks in Beijing with China and other countries cutting across groups strongly backing India's demand for centre-staging discussions on equity, IPR and trade in UN climate change negotiations on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile noting that the emerging economies, along with other developing countries, had committed more to fight climate change than the rich countries, India's restored stance on climate change also found support from China and Brazil.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSouth Africa advocated that talks at Durban launch formal negotiations for a new compact bringing emerging economy under international commitments as well. But India, China and Brazil were united in opposing such a proposition noting that the developed world was yet to deliver on existing commitments and was asking for more flexibility from the BASIC group without any returns. India's restored position against uneven compromises at the UN talks was echoed by Brazil and China, ensuring that the formal BASIC statement did not refer to the issue.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNatarajan won support for the inclusion of equity, IPR and trade issues on climate agenda for Durban from not only the three BASIC countries but also Argentina heading the G77 grouping, Grenada on behalf of small island states and Egypt representing Arab countries. The three were present as observers at the Beijing meeting.The four BASIC countries stated in a joint statement, "Ministers underlined the importance of the Indian proposal to include the issues of equity, trade and intellectual property\u2026 they agreed that discussions on these important issues, which are crucial to many developing countries, would contribute to comprehensive and balanced outcome at Durban."At the ministerial level talks held recently at Pretoria, South Africa had pushed more strongly for formally starting talks on a new deal but at Beijing, it was hemmed in by the unanimity shown by other three BASIC countries. At Pretoria, it had faced opposition to the proposal, which was initially fathered by the EU, from not just the three BASIC countries but also from the US, UAE, Indonesia and South Korea.At the two-day BASIC meeting in Beijing, the four countries upped the stakes on Kyoto Protocol with a warning that they would not support carbon trading with those developed countries which did not commit to targets under the second phase of Kyoto Protocol. Carbon trading allows the developed countries to find cheaper avenues of reducing greenhouse gases, instead of undertaking mitigation actions at a higher cost in their backyard.Also choking off any attempt by developed countries to use an impending review of achievements under the treaty to rewrite the UN climate convention, the four also took a common position that the appraisal should include assessment of the adequacy of global temperature goal, the sufficiency of targets of the rich countries and their financial and technological support to the developing world.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aIndia, China, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 the BASIC group of developing countries \u2013 on Tuesday sought to bridge their differences and strike a common position ahead of this month\u2019s climate change conference in Durban, calling on the West to ensure the extension of the Kyoto Protocol as well as step up financial and technological assistance to developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe Durban conference, they said in a joint statement, \u201cshould achieve a comprehensive, fair and balanced outcome\u201d and \u201cclearly establish the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol,\u201d which the statement described as \u201cthe cornerstone of the climate regime\u201d and \u201cthe essential priority\u201d for the summit\u2019s success.\u000a\u000aThe meeting between the environment ministers of the BASIC countries \u2013 the last before Durban \u2013 has drawn attention amid reports of differences within the influential block of emerging nations.\u000a\u000aSouth Africa has been seen as coming under particular pressure to strike a balance between the BASIC group\u2019s position and the West under its additional responsibility as host of the summit and acting president of the Conference of Parties.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, however, South Africa\u2019s lead climate negotiator, Alf Wills, sought to draw a line over reports that his country was moving away from the essential BASIC position that developing countries, unlike developed Annex-1 countries, would not accept legally binding emission reduction commitments.\u000a\u000a"There has always been this misunderstanding that South Africa is advocating that developing countries take on these quantified emissions reduction objectives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is untrue. We have always held the position that we will meet our legal obligation to take mitigation actions consistent with our respective common but differentiated responsibilities and our respective capabilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aSouth Africa, he said, shared the view of the BASIC group that \u201cthe current Kyoto Protocol system, which elaborates those specific legal obligations that developed countries have in a multilateral rules-based system\u2026 provides the benchmark and cornerstone for any future climate change regime or system.\u201d\u000a\u000a"We don\u2019t want to risk losing 20 years of negotiating a comprehensive set of rules in the interests of allowing developed countries to take on weaker specific legal obligations,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aWhile South Africa did not appear to voice any disagreement with the BASIC position during meetings Tuesday, officials expressed the concern that once negotiations started in earnest in Durban, the country might face particular pressure as the host nation to dilute its stance.\u000a\u000a"There is a fear that there will be attempts by the West to divide the BASIC group,\u201d an official said.\u000a\u000aThe BASIC countries \u2013 and China in particular \u2013 have come under increasing pressure from the West to agree to a road map on undertaking legally binding emission reduction targets. The European Union has said it preferred \u201ca single global and comprehensive legally binding instrument,\u201d although it was open, in the interim, to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol on the condition that large emitters agree on a road map.\u000a\u000aThe BASIC statement also identified financing as \u201cone of the pressing priorities\u201d at the Durban conference, calling on developed countries to fulfil their commitment of providing US$ 30 billion as fast-start funding.\u000a\u000aMinister of Environment and Forests Jayanthi Natarajan said India was \u201ccompletely committed to the stand of BASIC countries\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe West, she said, had to come through with funding regardless of the current financial turmoil sweeping across Europe. \u201cWe are painfully conscious of their problems,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWhile the BASIC statement also urged developed countries to honour a commitment to provide US$ 100 billion per year by 2020, officials accepted that was increasingly unlikely following the debt crisis and the recession, and emerging countries would perhaps have to settle for \u201cmillions and not billions.\u201d\u000a\u000aXie Zhenhua, China\u2019s top climate official, did not rule out the possibility of bridging differences with the West despite EU insistence on developing countries taking on greater commitments.\u000a\u000a"In a multilateral mechanism, a solution is something that everyone can accept even if no one is satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this, each individual must make a compromise, but the basis of the compromise is to stick to commitments and conventions agreed to in Copenhagen and Cancun.\u201d

VUpdated: Wed, Nov 16 2011. 09 57 PM IST\u000a\u000aSo far, all attempts at securing a mutually acceptable global climate change limitation agreement have proved futile. The problem is not that countries don\u2019t agree to the need for one, but the details of such a deal.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, US President Barack Obama said as much when he said the forthcoming talks in Durban will be a \u201ctough slog\u201d. He also raised the issue of \u201cgreater responsibility\u201d on the part of India and China in arriving at an acceptable global regime.\u000a\u000aA glacier meeting the ocean in Antarctica (File photo Bloomberg) \u201cThe advanced economies can\u2019t do this alone; so part of our insistence when we are in multilateral fora, and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban, is that if we are taking a series of steps, then it\u2019s important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain,\u201d he said in Canberra, Australia. He added that he does not expect the two countries to do as much as the developed countries, and they were far off from catching up with advanced industrial countries in per capita emission terms.\u000a\u000aThis is the nub of the problem. It is called the principle of differentiated responsibility. Developing countries would like no responsibility on this front as it is largely historical emissions since the Industrial Revolution that are responsible for man-made climate change. The developed world does not agree. The problem, as always, is about drawing the line: the level of burden developing countries will have to shoulder.\u000a\u000aIn the past three years, there has been no sign of agreement on this subject. All attempts at it have failed. The one way out would have been to generously endow a \u201cgreen technology transfer fund\u201d.\u000a\u000aIf anything, Western countries have been niggardly in agreeing even to this limited cash transfer to poorer countries. With a looming global recession, the chances for this are not bright any more, if they ever were.\u000a\u000aUnless some out-of-the-box idea can be conjured up at this late hour, such transfers remain the only viable option for a climate deal. A commitment to create a $500 billion fund would be a good starting point. More would certainly be needed. The sooner industrial countries realize that, the better it will be. Otherwise, Durban, too, will join the ranks of a failed summit.\u000a\u000aWhat is needed for a successful climate change deal? Tell us at views@livemint.com

VFarmers now get an alert on their mobile phones of sudden climate variations that can harm their crops.\u000a\u000aThis is one of the innovative projects taken up by the central government to help farmers adapt to climate change in the country\u2019s 100 most vulnerable districts, climate-wise.\u000a\u000aDr B Venkateswarlu, director of Hyderabad based Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture said the Rs 350 crore project has been launched with an aim to educate farmers about the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture.\u000a\u000aIn this project, sensors have been installed in farms which record the varying temperature. As soon as the temperature falls below a certain level, which can be harmful for crops, an automatic SMS is sent to the farmer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt provides two to three hours to the farmers to deal with the situation,\u201d he said. One such option is to light a fire to increase the ground temperature so that damage to the crop can be minimized. There have been huge losses to wheat crops in Punjab and Haryana during winter months because of the frost.\u000a\u000aThe new SMS alert system has been tested in Indian Council for Agricultural Research farms and is now being implemented in fields in the Indo-Gangetic plane, which is most prone to crop damage from cold wave.\u000a\u000aVenkateshwarlu at a Centre for Science and Environment workshop said that climate change can cause a fall in wheat production by 10-15 % and cereal production by 10-40 % depending on the increase in temperature.\u000a\u000aResearch has also shown that rabi crop is more vulnerable to climate variation as compared to the kharif crop, especially in northern India. In addition, an increase in temperature would result in a fall in per cow milk production and fish production, especially in the Bay of Bengal.\u000a\u000aThe Indian Institute for Tropical Meteorology, which has a centre for climate change, has found that monsoon rainfall has reduced in states such as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala whereas it has increased in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Jammu amd Kashmir.\u000a\u000aImpact of climate change on monsoon in the Indian context is now well documented.\u000a\u000aCentral India witnessed up to 30 % less rainfall during the monsoon. On the other hand, climate change has caused heavy downpour in districts in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, which were traditionally drought-prone. \u201cAs many as 14 districts in Bihar faced drought whereas 15 others were flooded with excessive rain,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTo reduce impact of climate change on agriculture, the agriculture ministry has embarked upon the project where farmers are advised on climate resilient crops and ways to minimize the impact of climate change. This SMS alert is one component of the project.

Between 2013 and 2020, the countries will have to commit on their voluntary climate change actions without any conditions.\u000a\u000aIndia has declared to reduce its emission intensity by 20-25% of its 2005 levels by 2020 with a condition that rich nations would provide money and transfer clean technology to meet the target. So far, rich nations have been dithering on funding the clean technology transfer mechanism and providing finance to the developed world to fight climate change.\u000a\u000aBut China has taken a slightly different line by agreeing to make its voluntary action of checking growth of its emissions as a binding requirement under the climate change treaty.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndia and China are not comparable,\u201d said a senior environment ministry official. \u201cChina\u2019s emissions are five times more than that of India and economically also they are much ahead\u201d.\u000a\u000aBut, India has found some support from the United States, which believes that a pledge to reduce emissions is a commitment and it should not be backed through a legal instrument.\u000a\u000aClimate experts, however, say the issue of legally binding climate treaty would be a thorny issue at the meeting of 17 most powerful economies in the world in Washington. They also claim that the European Union has been shifting its goalpost on supporting the second commitment period for Kyoto Protocol, which could be a major reason for the failure of climate talks in Durban, South Africa, later this month.

VNEW DELHI: US President Barack Obama on Wednesday tried to make emerging economies like India accountable for the outcome at Durban climate talks.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the Indian government ruled out discussions on a new legally binding deal in South Africa until the developed world fulfills its existing legal commitments.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"As far as India is concerned, it's not our agenda to have a discussion on a legally binding agreement (at Durban)," R R Rashmi, a key negotiator for the government and joint secretary in the Union environment and forests ministry, told a media gathering.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"In Durban, we hope to convince everyone to first achieve the agreed outcomes of the Bali Action Plan and to ensure that the legal obligations of all parties (countries) are met under the Kyoto Protocol ."Rashmi was reacting to questions on the EU-backed proposal that emerging economies enter into formal and time-bound discussions on a new legally binding agreement.Earlier, the four BASIC countries had said they preferred to wait for the UN's IPCC report \u2014 due in 2014 \u2014 and a review of the achievement under the convention before talks on a new deal begins.On Wednesday, the US began a public outreach to pin the blame for inaction on emerging economies. Obama, speaking in Australia on Wednesday, said the US was doing a lot but "they've (India and China and other emerging countries have) got to take seriously their responsibilities as well"."The advanced economies can't do this alone. So part of our insistence when we are in multilateral forum \u2014 and I will continue to insist on this when we go to Durban \u2014 is that if we are taking a series of step, then it's important that emerging economies like China and India are also part of the bargain," he added.

VUpdated: Wed, Nov 30 2011. 01 04 AM IST\u000a\u000aDurban: Thirteen of the warmest years recorded have occurred within the last decade and a half, proving that global warming is a reality, the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe year 2011 caps a decade that ties the record as the hottest ever measured, the WMO said in a provisional report on climate trends and extreme weather events, unveiled at UN climate talks in Durban.\u000a\u000aUN officials said the 2012 UN climate talks known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP 18, will be hosted in major gas exporter Qatar. South Korea will host a ministerial meeting ahead of the conference.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur science is solid and it proves unequivocally that the world is warming and that this warming is due to human activities,\u201d WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud said in a statement, adding that policy makers should take note of the findings.\u000a\u000a\u201cConcentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached new highs and are very rapidly approaching levels consistent with a 2 to 2.4 Celsius rise in average global temperatures.\u201d\u000a\u000aScientists believe that any rise above the 2.0 threshold could trigger far-reaching and irreversible changes over land and in the seas.\u000a\u000aThe 2002-2011 period equals 2001-2010 as the warmest decade since 1850, the report said. 2011 ranks as the 10th warmest year since 1850, when accurate measurements began.\u000a\u000aThis was true despite a cooling La Nina event\u2014one of the strongest in 60 years \u2014that developed in the tropical Pacific in the second half of 2010 and continued until May 2011.\u000a\u000aThe report noted that the cyclical climate phenomenon, which strikes every three to seven years, helped drive extreme weather events including drought in east Africa, islands in the equatorial Pacific and the southern US. While La Nina, and its meteorological cousin El Nino, are not caused by climate change, rising ocean temperatures caused by global warming may affect their intensity and frequency, scientists say.\u000a\u000aAverage surface temperatures over land were above long-term averages in most regions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no single country that has reported 2001-2010 mean temperatures that are colder than their national long-term average from 1961-1990,\u201d WMO deputy secretary general R.D.J. Lengoasa told journalists in Durban, citing a forthcoming review of weather trends over the last ten years.\u000a\u000aFor 95% of 80 countries that had submitted relevant data, 2001-2010 was the warmest decade on record, he added. 40% had seen national heat records broken in 2001-2010, as compared with 15% in the 1991-2000 period, and 10% in the 1981-1990 period.\u000a\u000aReuters contributed to this story.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aPeople living on hillslopes and slums in the city will soon have solar streetlighting facility as part of the Solar City project of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC).\u000a\u000aThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Resources (MNRE) has approved the proposal submitted by the VMC.\u000a\u000aOn a pilot basis, the streetlights in the hilly areas of One Town will be converted into solar streetlights. Plans are afoot to bring the bustling Mogalrajpuram and a few other areas under the project which aims at studying the efficacy of solar batteries used for the streetlighting.\u000a\u000aSolar energy can be easily tapped in hilly regions compared to the plains.\u000a\u000aThe VMC has installed three solar lights on the premises of the Rajiv Gandhi Park near Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) on an experimental basis.\u000a\u000aMunicipal Commissioner G. Ravi Babu said the corporation would call tenders for installation of solar streetlights soon. The tender process is likely to be completed by the year-end paving the way for the implementation of the project in January 2012.\u000a\u000aThe VMC has allocated funds to the tune of around Rs. 30-35 crore per annum for the purpose. The overall budget may go up to Rs. 139 crore, said Mr. Ravi Babu.\u000a\u000aThe engineering wing of the corporation has been asked to spell out the requirements to switch to the new streetlighting system across the city. The city has over 27,000 tubelights and the VMC will be able to save power if the entire streetlighting is based on solar power, he said.\u000a\u000aThe VMC master plan envisages transformation of Vijayawada into a solar city. It has a database of electricity consumption in the city and the estimated carbon emission levels. It has set a goal of a minimum of 10 per cent reduction in the projected total demand of conventional energy at the end of five years, to be achieved through saving energy by following energy-efficiency measures and generation from renewable energy installations. Vijayawada is one of the 16 cities identified under the Rajiv Solar Energy Mission Project by the Central government.

VA bid to impose carbon tax on aviation and maritime transport has got thumbs down from developing nations with Cuba terming it a violation of the basic principle of the United Nations climate convention of common but differentiated responsibility.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe International Civil Aviation Organisation and International Maritime Organisation have proposed carbon tax on the lines of what Europe would be implementing for flights landing there from January 2012.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at the ongoing Durban Climate Change Conference on behalf of India, China, Argentina, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Egypt and Algeria, Cuba accused the two organisations of trying to burden developing countries for meeting emission reduction targets of developed countries.\u000a\u000aThe international organisations want a global framework of carbon tax on airlines and shipping companies, which fail to meet emission norms of certain regions, such as Europe.\u000a\u000aThe European Union wants to extend its carbon tax regime called Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to the shipping sector by 2015 and is looking at ratification of the same from the UN's top climate body.\u000a\u000aAccording to UN convention, rich nations are required to reduce emissions and pay for climate mitigation in the developing world. The proposal, however, aims to turn the tables.\u000a\u000a"These measures would have political, economic and social implications and affect trade, particularly in the developing world," the statement said.\u000a\u000aCuba also accused the two international organisations of proposing a tax regime without considering objections from developing countries. Indian environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan has already written to the European Commission opposing the "unfair" tax. Her sentiments were reflected in Cuba's statement which emphasised the need for transfer of technologies and money for developing nations to improve international transport.

VCHICAGO: Wolves will help humans understand the effect of climate change on endangered animals. Scientists studying populations of grey wolves in USA\u2019s Yellowstone National Park have developed a way to predict how changes in the environment will impact on the animals\u2019 count, body size and genetics, among other biological traits.The researchers say they can predict the extent to which climate change could simultaneously impact animal\u2019s population and their likely evolution. The results could be used by other groups to predict how future wolf population will respond to climate change and report the changes to conservationists.The study provides a powerful mathematical model to explore the links between environmental change, changes in population size and simultaneous recent rapid physical changes such as the shrinkage that has been seen in animals like polar bears and Soay sheep.The research was led by London\u2019s Imperial College and involved colleagues at the United States department of the interior, Utah State University and the University of California.Earlier studies have shown that, if they persist over a long period, even small changes in traits like body size and weight as well as other characteristics such as coat colour, age at reproduction and average life span can have a profound effect on a species' future population size.The authors of the study say their formulae could be used to give improved predictions for population of other species for which there exists enough data on the species and the environment in which it lives.\u201cWe know that climate change is having an impact on the lives of animal species around the world. This is clear through the changes we\u2019ve seen in their population sizes as well as their body sizes, but what has not been so clear is what underlies these changes. This work provides a relatively easy way for biologists to investigate how, and why, environmental change impacts both the ecology and near term evolutionary future of species,\u201d said professor Tim, the study team leader.

VJagdish Bhagwati\u000a\u000aBy:The 17th conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, popularly known as COP-17, is taking place in Durban, South Africa, at a critical moment, as the historic 1997 Kyoto Protocol is set to expire next year. But, like the climate-change conferences in Copenhagen in 2009 and in Cancn in 2010, COP-17 can be expected to spend much and produce little.Indeed, the extravagance of these conferences seems to grow, than shrink, as their dismal results become more apparent. COP-15 in Copenhagen is estimated to have attracted 15,000 delegates and 5,000 journalists. The carbon emissions created by so many people flying to Denmark was real, while the emissions targets that the conference sought remained beyond reach. That will be true in Durban too \u2014 and on an even greater scale.The real problem is that the expectations concerning meaningful action on climate change are now lower than ever. There are two problems that cannot be wished away. First, the US under Obama's ineffective leadership has drifted yet further into a 'What's in it for me?' attitude on key issues requiring international action.In place of what the economist Charles Kindleberger once called an 'altruistic hegemon', the America that the world now faces is what I call a 'selfish hegemon'. Thus, the US has virtually pulled out of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, with Obama acquiescing to greedy business lobbies that will not settle unless more of their demands are met.But not only has Obama abandoned Doha; he has also seriously endangered the multilateral trading system by diverting US efforts and resources to discriminatory bilateral trade deals and, most recently, to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will principally aid countries that are worried about an aggressive China and seek political security rather than increased trade.The same is true of environmental action: after Australia's belated ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, the US remains the only country that has not ratified the agreement. The second problem is that the sheer weight of the US in international affairs, though diminished nowadays, has nonetheless led to a corruption of the principles that should underpin a new climate-change treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol.For example, unlike the World Trade Organization, whose dispute-settlement mechanism imposes penalties for abandoning negotiated reductions of trade barriers, the targets for emission reductions are not binding and enforceable commitments. The US has not agreed to accept such sanctions for failing to meet emissions targets; but, without penalties, the exercise is largely futile and only encourages cynicism about the effort to combat climate change.

VThe Durban climate conference,marked by tension,sleepless nights and high drama (to which the environment minister,Jayanthi Natarajan,contributed in no small part)  arrived,36 hours after the scheduled end of the conference,at a set of historic decisions. These include decisions to implement the Cancun Agreements,operationalise the Green Climate Fund,extend the Kyoto Protocol for a second commitment period,and launch a new process to negotiate a future climate regime. This was a package deal,in that without an agreement to negotiate a future climate regime,the EU would not have agreed to a Kyoto second commitment period.\u000a\u000aParties launched a process titled The Durban Platform on Enhanced Action to negotiate a Protocol,another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all. This instrument is scheduled to be adopted in 2015,and implemented from 2020. Although the media has interpreted this decision to mean that all major emitters,developed and developing alike,will be legally bound to GHG emissions cuts from 2020,the tortured language used in this decision masks a vast terrain of contestations.\u000a\u000aIndia,until the final hours of the conference,had insisted that agreeing to a legally binding instrument was a cabinet-mandated red line that it could not cross. It could agree at best to launch a process towards a legal outcome  which would leave the precise legal form of the instrument open. A legal outcome could encompass legally binding instruments as well as Conference of Parties decisions,which although operationally significant,are not,save in the exception,legally binding. This formulation lacked the clarity and ambition that the EU,the Alliance of Small Island States,the Least Developed Countries,many Latin American countries,and even Indias BASIC allies,Brazil and South Africa,were seeking. Critically,this was not sufficient for the EU to endorse a second commitment period. After a fast and furious huddle in the final hours of the conference,India agreed to substitute the term legal outcome with a marginally less ambiguous term,agreed outcome with legal force,thus triggering the acceptance of a Kyoto second commitment period by the EU and its allies.\u000a\u000aUnlike the terms protocol and another legal instrument the term,agreed outcome with legal force does not reflexively signal a legally binding instrument. Nevertheless,Indias room for maneouvre in negotiating the future climate regime has,through this decision,been dramatically constrained. Constrained not just in terms of the legal form of the outcome of this process,which will likely be a legally binding instrument,but also in terms of the nature and extent of differentiation it contains in favour of developing countries.\u000a\u000aThe Durban Platform decision does not contain a reference to equity or common but differentiated responsibilities. This is no benign oversight. Through the two weeks of the conference,developed countries were unanimous in their insistence that any reference to common but differentiated responsibilities must be qualified with a statement that this principle must be interpreted in the light of contemporary economic realities. They were also insistent that the future regime must be applicable to all. India,among other developing countries,argued in response that this would tantamount to amending the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The only way out of this impasse was to draft the text such that it was rooted in the Convention  under the Convention  thereby implicitly engaging its principles,including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. This,it was believed,would hold efforts to reinterpret and qualify this principle at bay. Nevertheless,the fact that the divisions on the application of this principle are such as to preclude even a rote invocation of it,signals a likely recasting of differentiation in the future climate regime.\u000a\u000aThe use of the term applicable to all further substantiates this point. Admittedly,merely because this instrument applies to all parties does not necessary imply that it applies symmetrically to all parties. However,the political context for the inclusion of this term,in particular in the face of the conspicuous absence of the usual markers for differentiation  equity and common but differentiated responsibilities  makes it crystal clear that the goal posts on differentiation will shift post-2020.\u000a\u000aIt is also significant that it was deemed necessary to launch a new process. The Bali Action Plan,2007,which launched a process to reach an agreed outcome on long-term cooperative action on climate change could have offered the basis for a new climate regime. The Bali Action Plan,however,is interpreted by developing countries as creating a firewall between developed country commitments and developing country actions. In a bid to move away from the Bali firewall,the US,among others,insisted on a new process,and on terminating the Bali process in 2012. Durban delivered the new process and with it,a clean slate on differentiation. The mandate will be negotiated in 2012.\u000a\u000aIt might be useful for India in future to use equity not as a shield,as it has thus far,to guard (ineffectively) against commitments,but as a sword to actively shape the agenda for climate action post-2020. Had India signalled a willingness to consider a legally binding instrument before it was compelled to,it could have harnessed the goodwill thus generated to ensure a central role for equity. This was not to be in Durban,but India may yet,with some re-orientation of its negotiating strategy,recover lost ground in the mandate discussions.\u000a\u000aThe writer is professor of international law,Centre for Policy Research,New Delhi\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VHad the world's leaders decided to ensure that global warming would increase to 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, perhaps to 5 degrees Celsius, instead of the 1.5-to-20 degrees Celsius threshold (over preindustrial temperatures) that scientists believe earth can tolerate, they couldn't have acted more purposively than they did at the Durban climate conference. If this sounds like a harsh judgement that radically differs from the official spin that Durban was a historic success, a victory for climate equity, and an Indian triumph, consider the following.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDurban was the world's last chance to make global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions peak by 2020, and breathe new life into the world's sole legally binding climate agreement \u2014 the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 beyond 2012, when its first phase ends. Unless industrialised countries of the North reduce their 1990-level emissions by 40-45% by 2020, and emissions start falling rapidly after that, irreversible, catastrophic climate change will become inevitable. But Durban decided to postpone any significant climate action till after 2020, when it would be too late. The decision on extending Kyoto, with stiff quantitative targets for northern countries, was also postponed to next year's climate conference. The protocol will become, in the graphic words of Bolivian negotiator Pablo Solon, a soulless "zombie" until replaced by an even weaker agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWorse, the roadmap agreed four years ago at Bali, which erected a firewall between the North's obligations and the South's voluntary actions, will be abandoned next year. The Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action, established in Bali to strengthen the convention's implementation, will be "terminated". A new process will begin, with considerable dilution of the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) principle, which maintains that while all countries share a duty to protect the climate, their obligations are unequal: the North must do more than the South because it's responsible for nearly three-fourths of all GHGs accumulated in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aDurban, then, was a disaster for global climate protection. Another four-degree warming will cause devastation, and threaten the survival of a majority of the world's population, including poor, vulnerable Indians. Under the key outcome, \u2018The Durban Platform for Enhanced Action', countries will negotiate by 2015 "a protocol, another legal instrument, or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all". This tortuous wording reflects India's last-ditch attempt to reject binding commitments, but effectively shifts climate responsibility from North to South. Durban thus sealed climate apartheid, under which rich polluters evade responsibility, but underprivileged people suffer the worst effects of climate change for which they are least responsible.\u000a\u000aYet, much of our media says India forced a "climate breakthrough" and "regained its position as the \u2026 moral voice of the developing world". According to environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan, India "restored" equity, including CBDR, "as a central dimension" of the talks. However, the platform does not even mention equity or CBDR. The North wanted an altogether different climate regime from that defined by the 1992 Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Bali Action Plan. Any CBDR mention, the North insisted, must be qualified by an interpretation based on "contemporary economic realities", including recent North-to-South power shifts, and China and India's emergence as top emitters. This would have opened a Pandora's Box.\u000a\u000aThe truth is, the rich countries, led by the European Union (EU), succeeded in cornering the BASIC (Brazil-South Africa-India-China) grouping, formed in 2009. The EU made its support for extending Kyoto conditional upon an agreement at Durban for all major emitters accepting climate obligations under a new deal to be signed by 2015. It shifted goalposts because of growing domestic climate pessimism amidst a massive economic crisis. The developing countries further split, with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the least developed countries (LDCs), allying with the EU. Some of them resented BASIC's insistence on "the right to develop". "While they develop, we die," Grenada's ambassador said.\u000a\u000aIntra-BASIC differences widened. South Africa and Brazil were willing to accept binding commitments, but not China and India. South Africa, the conference host, was keen to declare it a success by supporting the EU-led bloc. China indicated "flexibility" by offering to accept binding commitments on certain conditions, including a Kyoto extension covering all Northern emitters, higher ambition, and immediate activation of the promised $100-billion Green Climate Fund for developing countries. These conditions weren't going to be fulfilled. And the fund remains an empty shell. But China's move highlighted differences with India. "Inflexible" India got isolated. India failed to anticipate and counter the EU's attempt to win over the most vulnerable and poorest of developing countries through financial promises, coercion and threats, similar to those used at and after the 2009 Copenhagen conference, as revealed by WikiLeaks.\u000a\u000aThere was much wrangling over the binding commitment language. India wanted "legal outcome" to follow "legal instrument" but settled for "agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all". Natarajan claims this means the obligations must be in keeping with the convention's principles, including CBDR, and "that this decision does not imply that India has to take binding commitments to reduce its emissions in absolute terms in 2020". But India's own BASIC partners disagree. More vitally, Durban's political context, with sharp divisions over CBDR's application, suggests that differentiation will undergo substantial revision in the North's favour.\u000a\u000aIndia could have prepared itself better for Durban had it not put all its eggs in the BASIC basket, with the risk of being equated with China, the world's biggest emitter, with per capita emissions nearing Western Europe's while India's are close to the LDCs. India could have built a coalition by offering AOSIS and LDCs need-based financial and technological assistance in climate change adaptation, and strengthened the G-77 developing-country bloc. It could then have pressed the EU for supporting a Kyoto extension, and produced worthier results. India didn't summon up the policy independence and strategy this needed. It lost the plot.\u000a\u000aPraful Bidwai is a New Delhi-based political commentator and environmental activist. The views expressed by the author are personal.

VPATNA: The rain came down suddenly a day before the New Year eve and the cloud continued to overcast the sky even on New Year, with the occasional dull sun peeping out. Met office sources said here that the rainfall was because of a western disturbance and the sky will clear up by Saturday.\u201cIncidentally, the state is witnessing a climatic change for over the last five years. The long cold wave spells are no longer experienced in winter and winters are not that harsh what it used to be,\u201d added met office sources.Even the statistics of the Met department reveals that on January 1, 2009, the minimum and maximum temperature recorded was 8.2 and 23.5 degrees Celsius, while the year 2008 recorded 8.5 and 22 degrees Celsius on January 1 and 2007 also had a minimum of 8.3 and a maximum of 23.8 degrees Celsius on this day.Weathermen even attribute this rise in temperature to global warming.However, as deputy director general meteorology (weather forcasting), IMD, Pune, A B Majumdar said, \u201cVariations in weather conditions are normalphenomenon as it depends on many factors. Nothing can be predicted on the basis of short term data analysis. In fact, not very significant change has come to light in terms of global warming.\u201dBut New Year revellers shrugged off the gloomy damp weather and chill. Partygoers braved the cold weather and celebrated the stroke of midnight.Revellers packed the traditional New Year\u2019s eve haunt and all the posh hotels of the city were booked in advance and people had started trooping in from 7 pm onwards.The day was greeted with pop of champagne corks, bursting of crackers and ringing of church bells. Elsewhere around the city, where planned activities went ahead regardless, with revellers wrapped up in warm clothes to brave the chill and cold winds.Almost all the picnic spots, pubs, clubs all were overcrowded.Many parties were organized even on the banks of the Ganga and Ganga diara where arrangements were made for special food and liquor. Some revellers, braving the cold and chill even spent their night partying on the river bank to see the first sun rise of the New Year.In fact, celebrations had started well in advance on December 31 night with people hurrying home and then proceeding to parties, gathering and outing beating away both the weather and recession blues.Special arrangements were made by the district administarion and police to thwart any untoward incident.

VNEW DELHI: In a departure from the line taken by his environment minister, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his disappointment over the Copenhagen Accord on climate change. Addressing the 97th Indian Science Congress on Sunday, the Prime Minister said nations \u201cmade limited progress\u201d at the climate change conference at Copenhagen and that \u201cno one was satisfied with the outcome\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnvironment minister Jairam Ramesh has maintained that India had protected its interests. Even so, Mr Ramesh acknowledges that the Copenhagen Accord has \u201cin-built hazards\u201d for developing countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHis disappointment notwithstanding, prime minister Singh made it clear that all countries need to move to a low-carbon economy. He told scientists at Thiruvananthapuram: \u201cThere is no escaping the truth that the nations of the world have to move to a low greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficient development path.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Accord sets the goal of limiting global temperature increases to 2 degree celsius though it does not set any binding targets for emission reduction. Both developing and developed countries will have to inform UNFCCC of its commitment to reduce emission of greenhouse gases to mitigate the effects of climate change. The accord pledges $30 billion between 2010 and 2012 and $100 billion by 2020 for developing countries, particularly vulnerable countries and small island states, to help adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Copenhagen Accord could not be adopted due to objection by several countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Sudan. As a compromise measure, the Accord was \u201ctaken note of\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn this context, the prime minister called on scientists to \u201cdo much more\u201d as the scientific capability will determine India\u2019s ability to face the new challenges like climate change. \u201cWe face new challenges of climate change and the management of our scarce water resources. We also face old challenges of food security and disease control. In all these areas, our success will depend critically on the quality of our institutions of science and technology.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMr Singh said India must not lag behind in efforts to achieve greater energy efficiency, shifting to renewable sources of energy and chalking out strategies for adapting to climate change. \u201cIndia must not lag behind in these areas. Indeed we should plan to be among the leaders in the development of science and technology related to mitigation and also adaptation to climate change. The market for such technologies is not just India. It is indeed the whole world.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs far as India\u2019s energy basket was concerned, Mr Singh said renewable and clean energy supplies will need to play a much bigger role than at present. \u201cNuclear and solar energy supplies will need to increase considerably. The agreement reached last year with the Nuclear Suppliers Group represents a landmark in lifting long-standing restrictions on the transfer of nuclear fuel and technology to India. I am confident that we can now plan for an accelerated nuclear power development programme.\u201d

VMUMBAI: If globalisation was the driving factor for Tata Group in the last decade, going green may well be the buzzword for the present one. From being on the fringe, the green movement is gaining momentum within the group. India\u2019s oldest industrial house is stepping up efforts to reduce its carbon footprint across the value chain \u2014 from manufacturing processes to distribution networks to eco-friendly consumer products.For instance, Tata Steel aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at its Jamshedpur plant from the current 1.8 tonne to 1.7 tonne per tonne of liquid steel made by 2012. The ideal global benchmark though is 1.5.Tata Motors is setting up an eco-friendly showroom using natural building material for its flooring and energy-efficient lights. Tata Motors said the project is at a preliminary stage.The Indian Hotels Company, which runs the Taj chain, is in the process of creating eco rooms which will have energy-efficient mini bars, organic bed linen and napkins made from recycled paper. But there won\u2019t be any carpets since chemicals are used to clean those. And when it comes to illumination, the rooms will have CFLs or LEDs. About 5% of the total rooms at a Taj hotel would sport a chic eco-room design.One of the most interesting innovations has come in the form of a biogas-based power plant at Taj Green Cove in Kovalam, which uses the waste generated at the hotel to meet its cooking requirements.Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata had said during Swatch launch, a low-cost water a low-cost water purifier made from natural ingredients: \u201cWe have embarked on a group-wise initiative to create awareness and implement eco-friendly processes wherever it is possible and, in fact, look at some of our older processes to see how we can ensure that they are in compliance with the state-of-the-art exhibits. This is going to be a long and expensive journey and we are fairly committed to it.\u201dAnother eco-friendly consumer product that is in the works is Indica EV, an electric car that will run on polymer lithium ion batteries. Tata Motors plans to introduce the Indica EV in select European markets this year. The group\u2019s large companies such as Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Chemicals and Tata Consultancy Services contribute 80% of the group\u2019s overall emissions and a panel, headed by Tata Sons director JJ Irani, has been formed to address this issue. Several companies have already or are in the process of implementing clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. Tata Steel said it is currently working on more than 17 CDM projects with Ernst & Young and these projects are at various stages of approval at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Tata Power has said that of the total power it would generate in the next 10 years, 25% would be from renewable energy sources.Tata Motors is collecting environmental and energy data across its dealer and supply chain to compute their carbon footprint and identity opportunities for cutting down on carbon dioxide emission. This initiative will enable sharing and deployment of ideas throughout the value chain, said a Tata Motors spokesperson.A source in Indian Hotels said that all of its domestic and international hotels would be certified by Green Globe, an international agency by the end of 2010.

VGangasagar pilgrims try to keep warm in Calcutta. (Reuters) The current winter in Calcutta is one of the chilliest in memory with the temperature plummeting to 10.8 degrees Celsius on December 28. Weathermen think the mercury may dip further. Though Calcutta has witnessed a colder January  8.4 degrees Celsius in 1989  a below 11 degrees Celsius December temperature is rare. Does the chill counter the theories of climate change and global warming? Definitely not. It actually vindicates the theory of climate change; one has to understand that climate change and global warming are not synonymous. Warming is just one expression of climate change, says Jadavpur University professor Jayshree Roy. According to her, climate variability is actually leading to weather extremes, which means warm days are becoming warmer, rainy days bring more rain and cold days are becoming colder. Scientists warn that short-term variations in weather patterns should not be used to disprove theories on global warming. Weather is dependent on a host of factors, including currents like El Nino and Arctic Oscillation. There are other theories about winters becoming colder. Many scientists believe that the activity of the sun is linked to the appearance of sunspots which are dark, cool patches on the suns surface that come and go in roughly 11-year cycles. It has been observed that while warmer climate is linked to higher sun activity, the opposite applies for cooler conditions. The appearance of the little ice age in the 17th century is attributed to the absence of sunspots. In the 20th century, the sun was unusually active, peaking in the 1950s and the late1980s. But around the turn of the century, the suns activity declined and the rise in the earths temperature began to slow and has now been constant for the past few years.

VOur Bureau\u000a\u000aNew Delhi, Jan. 18\u000a\u000aFailure to comply with renewable purchase obligations (RPO) will attract \u2018regulatory charges' (penalty) for entities in the renewable energy business.\u000a\u000aThe nature of these charges will be laid down by the respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERC), according to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) sources.\u000a\u000aCERC on Monday notified regulation on Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) in fulfilment of its mandate to promote renewable sources of energy. The framework of REC is expected to give a push to renewable energy capacity additions in the country.\u000a\u000aElaborating on the \u2018regulatory charges' concept, sources said, \u201cThe regulatory charges will be levied based on the differential between the RPOs prescribed by the SERCs and the commitments met by the entity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe distribution companies, open access consumers and captive power plants will have the option of purchasing the REC to meet their RPOs. Pertinently, renewable purchase obligations are mandated by the SERC to purchase minimum levels of renewable energy out of the total consumption in the area of a distribution licensee.\u000a\u000aWith this regulation the CERC has given a broad framework for RECs. The Electricity Act, 2003, as well as the National Action Plan of Climate Change (NAPCC) provide a roadmap for increasing the share of renewable energy in the total generation capacity in the country. However, RE sources are not evenly spread across different parts of the country. It is in this context that the concept of REC assumes significance.\u000a\u000aIt seeks to address the mismatch between availability of RE sources and the requirement of the obligated entities to meet their renewable purchase obligations, CERC said.\u000a\u000aIt is also expected to encourage the RE capacity addition in States where there is potential for RE generation as the REC framework seeks to create a national level market for such generators to recover their cost.\u000a\u000aThe regulation envisages that there will be a central level agency to be designated by the CERC for registration of those who generate renewable energy (RE). The agency will also issue the RECs.\u000a\u000aThe RE generators will have two options \u2013 either to sell the renewable energy at preferential tariff fixed by the Electricity Regulatory Commission concerned or to sell the electricity generation and environmental attributes associated with RE generation separately. On choosing the second option, the environmental attributes can be exchanged in the form of REC.\u000a\u000aThe price of the electricity component would be equivalent to the weighted average power purchase cost of the distribution company, including short-term power purchase. However, it will exclude renewable power purchase cost. The value of REC will be equivalent to 1MWh of electricity injected into the grid from renewable energy sources.\u000a\u000aThe REC will be exchanged only in the power exchanges approved by CERC within the band of a floor price and a forbearance (ceiling) price to be determined by Central Commission from time to time. There will also be compliance auditors to ensure compliance of the requirement of the REC by the participants of the scheme.\u000a\u000aRelated Stories:

VIn revelations that embarrass the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 the UN body that has built the scientific base for action on climate change \u2014 and its chairman R K Pachauri, it's emerged that its key conclusion that there was high probability of Himalayan glaciers melting away by the year 2035 was based on unsubstantiated, indeed "speculative," evidence.\u000a\u000aIPCC's Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, which has been the main reference point for climate-change science, cited a 2005 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report to say that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear entirely by 2035 \u2014 "perhaps sooner" \u2014 if current trends in global warming continued.\u000a\u000aThat WWF report itself was based on an interview of Syed Iqbal Hasnain, an Indian researcher honoured with Padma Shri last year, published in the New Scientist in 1999.\u000a\u000aWWF today admitted that its 2005 report "contained erroneous information". "Although scientists remain deeply concerned about glacier retreat in that region, this particular prediction has subsequently proved to be incorrect," the WWF said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThere were reports that Hasnain \u2014 who is working with the Pachauri-led The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) since last year \u2014 had himself admitted that the 2035 reference in his 1999 interview was nothing more than "speculation" but he was not available today for comment.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC is already under scrutiny following the emergence of some leaked emails of its scientists some months ago, the contents of which revealed attempts to exaggerate the scientific evidence on global warming. Pachauri himself has come in for criticism for using his position for commercial gains, allegations that he has denied.\u000a\u000aBut the latest episode is a shot in the arm for Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh who has been deeply suspicious of the "alarming" projections made in IPCC report on glacier melt and has insisted that many more studies required to be done to say anything with conclusive evidence.\u000a\u000aIn fact, just before the Copenhagen conference, his ministry came out with a "discussion paper," authored by a former deputy head at the Geological Survey of India V K Raina, which made the same point.\u000a\u000a"It is premature to make a statement that glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating abnormally because of global warming. A glacier is affected by a range of physical features and a complex interplay of climatic factors. It is, therefore, unlikely that the snout movement of any glacier can be claimed to be a result of periodic climate variation until many centuries of observations become available. While glacier movements are primarily due to climate and snowfall, snout movements appear to be peculiar to each particular glacier," Raina had said in that report.\u000a\u000aThe revelations are an indictment of IPCC's claims that all conclusions in its assessment reports are put through extremely vigorous peer review by scientists all over the world.\u000a\u000aPachauri said the IPCC would verify all the information and would come out with the facts in the next few days. "There is no doubt that the glaciers are retreating. What has come to be questioned is the 2035 date. We will find out the source of that number," he said.\u000a\u000aMurali Lal, one of the authors of the chapter on glaciers in the fourth assessment report, admitted that this particular finding did not get extensive peer review.\u000a\u000aHe said a couple of years before the fourth assessment report was published, the IPCC rules were changed to allow the authors to include "grey literature" while making their conclusions.\u000a\u000a"Authors of the IPCC reports are mandated to go through all available literature, including some grey literature that has gone through limited peer review, while formulating their conclusions. WWF reports come under the definition of such grey literature," he told The Indian Express.\u000a\u000aMurari Lal lambasted Hasnain for making speculative statements. "Such scientists should be banned from getting government funding," he said.\u000a\u000aALSO READ In Orissa\u2019s \u2018liberated\u2019 zone, two villages take on the Maoists\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VCHANDIGARH: Glaciers are here to stay in the Himalayas. Studies conducted by glaciologists across the Himalayan region in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have shown that global warming has little to do with their melting.The conclusion was drawn by glaciologists after studying the behaviour of 35 Himalayan glaciers . The Mentossa glacier in Miyar valley of Lahaul-Spiti in Himachal Pradesh has, in fact, expanded in the last few years while there is no change in the Kangriz glacier in Zanskar valley of J&K since 1913.Glaciologists, claiming that global warming and melting of glaciers have no relation with each other, say each glacier is behaving in a different manner. Had global warming been responsible, then all of them would have behaved in a similar manner, they claimed.The prediction that glaciers would melt by 2035 by Professor Syed Iqbal Hasnain may have landed the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chairman R K Pachauri in a tight spot, but data collected by glaciologits across the Himalayan region shows that such claims do not hold water, and the major rivers orginitaing from the Himalayas would continue to flow for the years to come as the glaciers are going to stay.Glaciologist Milap Chand Sharma from Jawaharlal Nehru University says after studying 27 glaciers in Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, he has found that the melting taking place is normal. His conclusion is based on study of the behaviour of glaciers from 1975 to 2008.The Miyar glacier in Lahaul region covers an area of 27 square km. Since 1971, it has receded by just 150 meters. If it continues to melt at this pace, it would take around 3,000 years for it to melt completely, he added.A comparison of photographs of glaciers available from 1907 shows that after 1998, glaciesr have not changed much, says Sharma.

VWASHINGTON: US today pledged to cut its green house gas emission by 17% by 2020 from the 2005 level, hoping that countries like India and China would follow suit as agreed upon during the Copenhagen Summit on Climate Change in December.The special US envoy on Climate Change, Todd Stern, in a letter informed the UN Framework Conventional of Climate Change Secretariat about the Obama Administration's decision in this regard, which is part of the voluntary commitment made by economies including India and China during the Copenhagen Climate Change summit.In a statement, Stern said the Obama administration expects "that all major economies will honour their agreement in Copenhagen to submit their mitigation targets or actions as provided in the Accord."However, Stern told the world body that its commitment to reduce the green gas house gas emission by 17% by 2020 is contingent on Congress passing climate change legislation."The US submission reflects President Obama's continued commitment to meeting the climate change and clean energy challenge through robust domestic and international action that will strengthen our economy, enhance our national security and protect our environment," Stern wrote."US is committed to working with our partners around the world to make the accord operational and to continue the effort to build a strong, effective, science-based, global regime to combat the profound threat of climate change," Stern said.

It records the constraints felt by the children, how they adapt and what solutions they offer to reduce the impact of climate change.The book was released by A K Jha, commissioner of the Tribal Research Institute, Pune. He said that this would be the first time that people across the country heard the stories. The experiences and the solutions proposed by the children to mitigate the impact of climate change are noteworthy, he said.He applauded the efforts of the organisation and said that he would support them for future talks with the government in bringing about a better quality of life for the children, their families and communities.According to N Thomas Rajkumar, director of Holistic Child Development India, the stories provide new insights into the direction to be taken in tackling climate change.He said that the booklet is the outcome of a series of workshops held in Nagpur, Varanasi and Pune on the impact of climate change on children in North India. It reveals its impact on their education, health, mental pressure and the livelihood systems of their parents.Sukumar Devotta, former director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, stressed that climate change is a result of human activity. It leads to a loss in agricultural produce, destruction of human property, a rise in malnutrition and an increase in vector and water-borne diseases, among other problems. How we mitigate these problems and adapt to these changes is the challenge, he added.Children from across the country attended the programme and shared their experiences. Fifteen-year-old Koshila Kumari from Jharkhand spoke of the drought in her village. "Due to heat seven of our 15 goats have died. For water we have to walk to the village tank as the well dries up. The cattle suffer and die. The farmers borrow money and are unable to pay back. And, parents withdraw kids from school.''Rajesh from Gujarat said that drought leads to crop loss. "I was withdrawn from school and sent to work in the carpet industry. I earned Rs 50 a month,'' he said.Holistic Child Development India is a humanitarian organisation and takes up different types of development projects which promote the rights, interests and dignity of children.

VHimalaya glacier error 'cost us dear': UN climate panel chief\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aby Staff Writers\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLondon (AFP) Feb 3, 2010\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe embattled chief of the UN climate change panel admitted Wednesday that a mistake in a landmark 2007 report had damaged the body's credibility, in an interview with a British newspaper.\u000a\u000aBut Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), refused to apologise in the interview with the Guardian for the erroneous claim that global warming could melt Himalayan glaciers by 2035.\u000a\u000aThe Nobel-winning panel has faced fierce criticism over the mistake -- which has been discredited by glaciologists and is being withdrawn -- and the controversy has given fresh ammunition to climate sceptics.\u000a\u000a"I think this (glacier) mistake has certainly cost us dear, there's no question about it," Pachauri told the newspaper.\u000a\u000a"Everybody thought that what the IPCC brought out was the gold standard and nothing could go wrong."\u000a\u000aBut when pressed to give a personal apology over the error -- just the latest controversy to hit the UN panel -- the climate scientist refused.\u000a\u000aHe said the IPCC had issued a statement expressing regret and he was not personally responsible for that part of the report.\u000a\u000a"You can't expect me to be personally responsible for every word of a 3,000 page report," he said, dismissing the idea of an apology as a "populist" move.\u000a\u000aThe revelation of the fake glacier claim was a heavy blow to the climate change panel, as the report it came from was regarded as the scientific touchstone for faltering global climate talks.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC's landmark Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 said the probability of glaciers in the Himalayas "disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high."\u000a\u000aBut there is no evidence the claim was published in a peer-reviewed journal, a cornerstone of scientific credibility, and reports in Britain have said the reference came from green group the WWF.\u000a\u000aDespite the damage done to the IPCC by the mistake and the negative publicity it has attracted, Pachauri called for people to move beyond the controversy.\u000a\u000aHe called for people to "look at the larger picture, don't get blinded by this one mistake."\u000a\u000a"The larger picture is solid, it's convincing and it's extremely important. How can we lose sight of what climate change is going to do to this planet?" he said.\u000a\u000aThe glacier error is just the latest controversy to hit the IPCC amid troubled UN climate talks, which were already severely set back after the near collapse of December's Copenhagen climate summit.\u000a\u000aThe panel came under ferocious attack ahead of the Copenhagen talks over hacked email exchanges which climate sceptics say reflected attempts to skew the evidence for global warming.

VNEW DELHI: Just when the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change thought it could put mistakes of the fourth assessment report behind it and carry on with its work, fresh instances of alleged manipulations have emerged. The UN climate change panel has admitted that its 2007 report wrongly stated that 55% of the Netherlands lies below the sea level.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is the second time that IPCC has had to admit to an error in the 2007 assessment report. Even as IPCC is dealing with its admission of a second error, allegations have been made that IPCC\u2019s claim of unequivocal rise in temperature may have been manipulated.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis error is part of the same working group II report which contained the erroneous claim that global warming could melt Himalayan glaciers by 2035.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the Dutch government had asked IPCC to explain the figure of 55% used in the 2007 report. They pointed out that only 26% of the Netherlands is below sea level. However, it would appear that the 55% figure includes 29% of the country which is prone to flooding. This includes land along the rivers above sea level.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIPCC in its note says that the 55% figure referred to the portion of the Netherlands which was \u201cat risk of being flooded\u201d. The panel maintained that irrespective of the higher figure used in the report, the conclusions continued to be tenable.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThe sea-level statistic was used for background information only, and the updated information remains consistent with the overall conclusions,\u201d an IPCC note states. Further, the UN panel stated that the figure had been used in successive publications to mean \u201ceither the area below the highest sea-level reached during storms, or the total area of the country that is prone to flooding from the sea and rivers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the panel accepted its mistake: \u201cTherefore, a preliminary analysis suggests that the sentence discussed should end with: Because 55% of The Netherlands is at risk of flooding.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor the troubled UN panel there appears to be no respite. Some researchers have alleged widespread and systematic tampering of data suggesting to a grossly overstated case for global warming. A report co-written by Anthony Watts, an American meteorologist and climate sceptic, shows photographs of weather stations near heat-generating equipment which could be distorting their readings. Some stations are located next to air-conditioning units or on waste-treatment plants or waste incinerator.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIPCC used data from the weather stations to back up claims that greenhouse gases had already caused a 0.7 degree centigrade rise in temperature, and gave warnings that further warming of up to 6C by 2100. Mr Watts study though not peer reviewed is backed by Professor John Christy, a former lead author on IPCC who specialises in atmospheric science at the University of Alabama, Huntsville.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis latest spate of admission of error and allegations could well help strengthen the claims of climate sceptics. IPCC, the definitive climate change panel, has been under attack since December, with the email leaks from the University of East Anglia, followed by faulty conclusions on the Himalayan glaciers, and now misrepresentation on the Netherlands.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe allegations of error range from typos in key dates to sloppy sourcing. This current round of mistakes is likely strengthen the claims of climate sceptics and force environmentalists back to square one and focus on proving that climate change is a threat, instead of the considering ways to deal with and stop it.

Swaminathan, Chairman of MSSRF, has a word with Lars Peder Brekk, Norwegian Minister of Agriculture and Food, at the International Conference on Biodiversity in relation to Food and Human Security in a warming planet, in Chennai on Monday. Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn, President of the WFPF (left), is also in the picture. | Photo Credit: \u2014 Photo: S.S. Kumar\u000a\u000aSpecial Correspondent\u000a\u000aInternational meet addresses challenge of food security in a warming planet\u000a\u000aCHENNAI: For every one degree rise in temperature, 6 million tonnes of wheat will be lost in India, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN estimates. How do you feed a hungry, growing world population with climate change knocking at the door?\u000a\u000aScientists, policy makers and researchers from 23 countries across the world gathered here on Monday began to address how the biological diversity of life on earth \u2014 the vast genetic array of plants, animals and micro-organisms \u2014 could be preserved, adapted and shared to provide enough food in a warming planet.\u000a\u000a\u201cTime is running out, not only in the short term of finding international solutions to climate change containment but also to establish the wide range of measures necessary to secure the biological diversity which we are dependent upon for long term food security, \u201d Norwegian Minister of Agriculture and Food Lars Pedder Brekk said.\u000a\u000aIn the last century alone more than 75 per cent of all known food crops have disappeared and the world relies on just a few varieties of rice, potatoes, maize, wheat and other staples.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately many of those lost or in decline are indigenous species that are the most nutritious, whether the green leafy vegetables of Africa or the millets of India, said Emile Frison, Director General, Biodiversity International. The double burden of hunger and obesity looms large \u2013 one in three people in the world are malnourished, he said.\u000a\u000aWe need to prepare ahead of time, he said, for the shifts in plant and crop species that will survive temperatures higher than the highest average temperatures of today.\u000a\u000aIncentivising governments to do so will be no easy task. But, suggested Angela Cropper, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, developing an internationally recognised dollar value for our environmental resources and the \u201cservices\u201d that the ecosystem provides, may prevent us from exploiting nature and serve as a means of protecting traditional cultures and farming methods. Crucial to the success of this was equal access to the benefits of genetic resources, whether new strains, or crop materials, she said.\u000a\u000aThe International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture is one of several frameworks established for this. More needs to be done, speakers said. \u201cI\u2019m still afraid of the population monster,\u201d Ambassador Kenneth M. Quinn of the World Food Prize Foundation said, quoting the father of the Green Revolution Norman Borlaug in one of his last addresses in 2005. Borlaug\u2019s solution, Professor Swaminathan said, of combining science with the needs of local farmers, is now more significant than ever.

VThe British academic at the centre of the \u2018Climategate\u2019 affair, whose raw data is crucial to the theory of climate change, has admitted that he has trouble \u2018keeping track\u2019 of the information.\u000a\u000aProfessor Phil Jones told the BBC on February 13 that there was truth in the observations of colleagues that he lacked organisational skills, that his office was swamped with piles of paper and that his record keeping is \u2018not as good as it should be\u2019.\u000a\u000aJones\u2019s data is crucial to the famous \u2018hockey stick graph\u2019 showing a supposed spike in global temperatures that has often been used by climate change advocates to support the theory.\u000a\u000aJones also conceded the possibility that the world was warmer in medieval times than now \u2014 suggesting global warming may not be a man-made phenomenon.\u000a\u000aHe also said that for the past 15 years there has been no \u2018statistically significant\u2019 warming.\u000a\u000aThe admissions will be seized on by sceptics as fresh evidence that there are serious flaws at the heart of the science of climate change and the orthodoxy that recent rises in temperature are largely man-made.\u000a\u000aJones has been in the spotlight since he stepped down as director of the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit after the leaking of emails that sceptics claim show scientists were manipulating data.\u000a\u000aThe raw data, collected from hundreds of weather stations around the world and analysed by his unit, has been used for years to bolster efforts by the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to press governments to cut carbon dioxide emissions. The panel is headed by Rajendra Pachauri of The Energy Research Institute in New Delhi.\u000a\u000aFollowing the leak of the emails, Jones has been accused of \u2018scientific fraud\u2019 for allegedly deliberately suppressing information and refusing to share vital data with critics.\u000a\u000aMore scientists have come out expressing doubts about the IPCC\u2019s claims that there was \u201cunequivocal\u201d evidence that global warming was taking place and that this was a product of man-made carbon emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe temperature records cannot be relied on as indicators of global change,\u201d said John Christy, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, a former lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , told the Times of London on Monday.\u000a\u000aChristy and other scientists have focussed on the thousands of weather stations across the globe used to collect temperature data for the past 150 years.\u000a\u000aThey believe these stations have been measuring increasingly higher temperatures because of urbanisation, changes in land use and, in many cases, being moved to different locations.\u000a\u000aChristy has published papers looking at these effects in east Africa, California and Alabama. \u201cThe story is the same for each one,\u201d he told The Times.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe popular data sets show a lot of warming but the apparent temperature rise was actually caused by local factors affecting the weather stations, such as land development.\u201d\u000a\u000aSimilar criticisms have been made by Professor Ross McKitrick, of the University of Guelph, Canada.\u000a\u000aHe was invited by the IPCC panel to review its last report and, as a consequence, became a strong critic of the panel and its methods.\u000a\u000aIn a later study of the panel\u2019s methods, he said, \u201cWe concluded, with overwhelming statistical significance, that the IPCC\u2019s climate data are contaminated with surface effects from industrialisation and data quality problems. These add up to a large warming bias.\u201d

VBANGALORE: Himalayan glaciers retreated by 16% in the last nearly five decades due to climate change, investigations by India\u2019s scientists in selected basins in four states has revealed. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers and loss in a real extent were monitored in selected basins in J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Sikkim, under a programme on space-based global climate change observation by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\u201cInvestigations on glacial retreat were estimated for 1,317 glaciers in 10 sub-basins from 1962. This has shown an overall reduction in glacial area from 5,866 sqkm to 4,921 sqkm since 1962, showing an overall de-glaciation of 16%\u201d, says the latest annual report of Isro. Snow cover monitoring of all basin has been completed, it said.Atlases for three years are ready and one for the fourth year is being prepared. Modeling response of Himalayan cryosphere to climate change has been initiated, Isro added. Meanwhile, a study on the impact of temperature and carbon dioxide (CO) rise on the productivity of the four major cereal food crops \u2014 wheat, rice, maize and pearl millet \u2014 revealed that yield of all of them showed reduction with increasing temperature.Assessment after taking field data showed that wheat was the most sensitive crop and maize the least sensitive to temperature rise among the four, Isro pointed out. Another study for climate change impact on hydrology was carried out using \u201cCurve Number\u201d approach to study the change in run off pattern in India at basin level. \u201cAnalysis shows there will be significant increase of run off in the month of June in most of the major river basins\u201d, the 2009-10 report of the Isro said. Isro has also observed a strong correlation between agriculture vegetation (mainly rice areas) and methane concentration.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aTwo months after being party to an agreed resolution at the U.N. climate change talks in Copenhagen, the United States seems to disown the decision.\u000a\u000aIn December, the conference decided that a Long-term Cooperative Action (LCA) text would be worked out and presented for adoption at the next summit. The U.S. was party to that decision.\u000a\u000aHowever, in its submission to the U.N. last week, the U.S. claims that \u201cit was not agreed that the LCA texts would be the basis of any future negotiation.\u201d Instead, it wants the Copenhagen Accord, a political agreement which was not even adopted at the summit, to be the basis of future negotiations.\u000a\u000aIndian negotiators say the submissions by various countries to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change outline the key battle lines being drawn as the talks resume in April.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. attempt to sneak in the word \u201cscrutiny\u201d (to describe international monitoring of voluntary attempts by developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) was thwarted by India, as The Hindu reported on Sunday. However, the U.S. view of which text will form the basis of future negotiations could cause India more worry.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. submission says: \u201cThe Copenhagen Accord achieves a number of landmark outcomes that\u2026provide a basis for an agreed outcome in Mexico,\u201d where the next major summit will be held in December 2010. It downplays the texts developed by the LCA working group over two years of multilateral talks, saying: \u201cSignificantly, it was not agreed that the LCA texts would be the basis of any future negotiation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis has no relation to reality, according to senior Indian negotiator Prodipto Ghosh. \u201cThe formal COP [conference of the parties] decision at Copenhagen extended the mandate of the LCA working group to enable it to present its outcome for adoption at Mexico,\u201d he points out. \u201cTherefore, it is not correct to say that. The COP did agree to the LCA texts.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo what about the Copenhagen Accord, on which the U.S. wants future talks to be based? \u201cIt was not even adopted by the conference. It was only taken note of,\u201d said Shyam Saran, the Prime Minister\u2019s Special Envoy on Climate Change, while addressing the European Business Group last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a political document with valuable content because it represents a broad consensus at a very high level. It is a valuable input, but it must go into the multilateral negotiation process now. Otherwise, it has no legitimacy or operationalisation,\u201d he said, echoing what India\u2019s submission to the U.N. said. Most developing countries, including China and Brazil, agreed strongly with that view.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will be a major dispute once we sit down for negotiations again,\u201d says Mr. Ghosh. As countries begin down the road to Mexico, the most basic issues are at stake once again.

VAfter the hurtful credibility siege of recent months, the United Nations Environment Programme is now planning to institute a check on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and form an independent review committee of senior scientists to examine its workings.\u000a\u000aThe IPCC, mandated to produce the final, authoritative reports on the impact of climate change, and to keep us updated on the science as it progresses by collating the work of thousands of scientists from across 100 countries, found itself highly embarrassed last month. It turned out that a widely thrown-around fact from its 2007 report, about the rate of Himalayan glacier melt, was in fact off by a few hundred years \u2014 and had found its way in via a speculative news report. Naturally, the earth shook: given how much governments, industry and citizens are staking on the certainty of climate change, any error in the IPCC documents is a serious matter. However, doubling back and attacking climate science would be disastrous, given the avalanche of data confirming that climate change is, if anything, only more dire than the IPCC's claims. While some may argue that the mistakes were indeed marginal (a mere bump on mountains of data all confirming the larger scientific consensus on "global weirding", which remains as robust as ever), the IPCC's errors have created an enormous setback, by providing fodder to the unconvinced. Climate deniers and delayers of every persuasion have seized on them with unconcealed glee, to undermine the very rationale for concerted global action and the sacrifices that will be required in coming years to deal with the spectre of climate change.\u000a\u000aSo this move to set up an independent body to oversee the IPCC's processes is a chance to refocus on the integrity of the science, to ensure that the peer-review process is faultless, and coordinate between the entire spectrum of scientific specialties that go into tracking climate change. The review committee will be demonstrably independent of the IPCC. It must serve as a commitment to greater rigour, and a promise that loopholes such as those that created last month's glacier fiasco will not be allowed to pass. It is also an important messaging exercise to turn the public's trust back to climate experts whose painstaking research the IPCC collates, and remind it that the science is not open to argument.\u000a\u000aALSO READ Error and trial\u000a\u000aPlease read our terms of use before posting comments

VNEW DELHI: The government on Monday came out in strong support of embattled Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) chief R K Pachauri , holding that it will `fight' any attempt to unseat him.Environment minister Jairam Ramesh told the Rajya Sabha that the government had `full confidence' in the `Indian chairperson' of the IPCC, even though the body has come under fire since revelations that its landmark Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 mistakenly predicted that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by the year 2035 as a result of global warming.While the government continues to back Pachauri, it had objected to `the panic and alarm' the IPCC report had spread about the melting of the Himalayan glaciers by 2035 without clear-cut scientific evidence, said Ramesh."India's objections to (some procedures adopted by) the report were upheld and we were vindicated,'' said Ramesh. The minister, however, added there were continuing concerns about the glaciers since most of them were retreating.Apart from establishing the National Institute of Himalayan Glaciology at Dehradun and asking the states concerned to adopt `best practices', the government is also trying to talk with countries like China, Nepal and Bhutan to work out a regional approach to the problem.

VLONDON: Australian scientists have found that whale faeces could help combat global warming by allowing the Southern Ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide.Researchers at the Australian Antarctic Division claimed that whale excrement, rich with iron, is a natural ocean fertiliser that can allow the whole eco-system to send more carbon down into deep waters. They believe that a larger population of baleen whales and krill would boost the productivity of the whole Southern Ocean ecosystem and could improve the absorption of carbon dioxide, blamed for global warming."The plants love it and it actually becomes a way of taking carbon out of the atmosphere," Antarctic scientist Steve Nicol said, adding the droppings appear as a plume of solids and liquids.According to the scientists, iron is a limited micro-nutrient in the Southern Ocean, but recent experiments have found that adding soluble iron to surface waters helps promote much-needed phytoplankton algal blooms.Iron is contained in algae in the surface waters where plants grow, but there is a constant rain of iron-rich particles falling into deep waters.When krill eat the algae, and whales eat the krill, the iron ends up in whale poo, and the iron levels are kept up in surface waters where it is most needed, the scientists said.Nicol said: "We reckon whale poo is probably 10 million times more concentrated with iron than sea water. The system operates at a high level when you have this interaction between the krill, the whales and the algae and they maintain the system at a very high level of production. So it's a self sustaining system."The idea to research whale droppings , the scientist said, came from a casual pub chat among Antarctic scientists in Australia's island state of Tasmania. He said it was not yet known how much poo it would take have a significant impact on the Southern Ocean.

The project envisages to provide the seeds of as many as 50 lost varieties of rice crops, which have been preserved in the gene bank of MSSRF in Chennai under the leadership of Dr. M. Geetharani based on a collection provided by a group of scientists led by Dr. Anilkumar in 1990s from the region.\u000a\u000aIn the preliminary stage the MSSRF would provide the samples of traditional seeds to the members of the Seed Care at free of cost. Apart from the rice varieties the Seed Care will promote the cultivation of different traditional varieties of lesser yam, pepper, ginger and vegetable seed in the near future, Dr. Anilkumar added.\u000a\u000aWe have planned to offer two types of memberships to the farmers such as individual membership and family membership but preference would be given to the traditional farming community especially the tribal farming communities such as Kuruma and Kurichya tribes in the district. The Seed Care would also under take the crop registration processes of the traditional seeds for its members as per the norms of the Union Agriculture Ministry. The first meeting of Seed Care will be held at the MSSRF Auditorium at 2.p.m on Wednesday and the interested farmers can join the farmers\u2019 collective at that occasion, Dr. Anil Kumar said.

VWASHINGTON: Global warming is making some parts of the oceans saltier, a new study claims.A research led by Australian scientists showed a clear link between salinity changes at the surface and changes in the deeper waters over the last six decades caused by the warming seen over the same period. "The saltiness or salinity of the oceans is controlled by evaporation and rainfall at earth's surface," said senior researcher Paul Durack of CSIRO, the Australian government's research agency."The supercharging of weather patterns by global warming is making some parts of earth's oceans much saltier while others parts are getting fresher," Durack wrote in the Journal of Climate. The more evaporation there is at a given patch of ocean, the more concentrated the salts get in the seawater and the higher the salinity, he said.The team analysed readings collected by an army of 3,200 ARGO buoys and found an enhancement in the average surface salinity in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

Chinese special envoy Dai Bingguo, also a state councillor, accompanied Hu during the talks along with foreign minister Yang Jiechi. Singh had Menon and commerce minister Anand Sharma by his side. The 13th round of boundary talks was held in Delhi in 2009, and the next round is scheduled for later this year.Thursday's meeting avoided the difficult issues and concentrated more on the feel-good factors. India has assiduously maintained a steady stream of high level contacts with the Chinese leadership, so even though Singh was meeting Hu after 10 months, he's had meetings with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, both at Hua Hin and Copenhagen, while foreign minister S M Krishna was in Beijing only last month. President Pratibha Patil is expected to be in China next month.Hu started off by apologising to Singh that he was responsible for speeding up the summit. Singh offered condolences for the huge loss of life and offered all assistance that China may want for relief. "As your government rallies to the assistance of the injured and displaced, I want to assure you we stand ready to render any assistance you or your government may require of us," Singh said.Hu said he now "subscribed to the PM's view that the world was big enough to accommodate the aspirations of India and China". Given that relations between the two have improved dramatically after Copenhagen, both countries are now looking at more coordination on climate change, Doha round and terrorism.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aWhen a community radio initiative of Anna University went on air, little did the students of Anna University know that it would tweak their own attitude towards environment.\u000a\u000aTheir attitude change was just an unexpected frill to the work of M. Haripriya, who, along with her friends, set up an FM channel to spread awareness of going green.\u000a\u000aThe channel was a creative upshot of her slew of eco-friendly initiatives taken to become part of the prestigious International Climate Change Champions, a project mooted by British Council.\u000a\u000aShe is now part of the 50-odd champions from India, who attended a weeklong brainstorming workshop on climate change at Mukteshwar, Uttaranchal.\u000a\u000aArmed with a project idea that promises to make a lasting impact on the society, each of the participants began their grass root-level initiatives to sensitise their neighbourhood.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy project was on the role of media in climate change. I thought community radios have a far-reaching impact and can influence people in a big way,\u201d says Haripriya, the final-year student of Anna University.\u000a\u000aK. N. Shruti, another climate change champion, believed in \u2018catching them young.' She conducted eco-kids camps for her neighbourhood kids and began distributing cloth bags to people.\u000a\u000aIf combating climate change begins in the classroom, then the climate change champions start right there. When S. Sundeep Kumar from Loyola was selected as a climate champion, the attitude change was perceptible among his classmates. \u201cPeople began to take our work seriously since we have been trained by the British Council. My friends now think twice before taking a plastic bag,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aConcurring with him, Shruti says the awareness is gradually spreading among her peer groups and NGOs, egging on her to plan adoption of a village. Haripriya, and others, now network with climate change champions from other countries to know the workable ways to save the environment.\u000a\u000a\u201cA key difference that we find in other countries is that they lobby with the government for sustainable solutions. The politicians are approachable and they manage to make their voices heard. In India, change can be effected, only in a small way as government officials are not accessible to us,\u201d Shruti observes.\u000a\u000aLike Sundeep Kumar, whose project on green business became an instant hit with people, the rest of the champions from the State are doing their bit for the environment in a noticeable way. With the growing response, the British Council has begun their hunt for the third batch of the champions and has floated online applications. \u201cWe ask for their project proposal and funding options. It is followed by an interview,\u201d explains Anu Thampi, project manager, International Climate Champions, British Council.

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThe coral reef wealth of the Gulf of Mannar, which is being conserved through joint efforts of various governmental, non-governmental and research agencies, is now facing a different kind of threat \u2014 global warming and consequent climate change.\u000a\u000aCoral reefs, known as rain forests of the sea, are a source of food security and livelihood options for hundreds of millions people, coastal defence and tourist hotspots. The Gulf of Mannar (GoM) is one of the four important coral reefs in India and thousands of artisanal fisher folk are dependant on fishery resources from this reef area.\u000a\u000aThough direct human impacts have resulted in vast destruction of the reef area and associated flora and fauna for the last three or four decades, strengthened enforcement of law, inclusion of corals under Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and enhanced awareness among the coastal community of coral reef conservation have arrested the decay.\u000a\u000aAfter the tsunami and various conservation and eco-developmental activities, coral mining was completely stopped in 2005 and there has also been a reduction in destructive fishing activities near the reef. These factors have resulted in the enhancement of live coral cover from 37 per cent in 2005 to 43 per cent in 2009 owing to stable substratum, initiation of coral restoration on six islands, successful reproduction and high coral recruitment.\u000a\u000aHowever, the effect of global climate change is always a threat to the corals, as they are very sensitive, and also to the fish population associated with reefs. The impact of climate change was clearly visible in 1998 in the Indian Ocean with many reefs, previously regarded as near pristine, seriously affected. The corals of GoM were also affected in 1998.\u000a\u000aTuticorin-based Suganthi Devadason Marine Research Institute, affiliated to Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, has been regularly conducting coral reef monitoring in GoM since 2005 with permanent monitoring sites and annual bleaching has been observed during summer every year since 2005 owing to elevated sea surface temperature.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe percentage of bleaching in live coral cover depends mainly on the wind, water currents, rainfall, turbidity and depth. The maximum affected corals are in the shallow waters \u2013 ranging from depths of 0.50 metres to 2 metres.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis summer, the coral bleaching was observed from the second week of April when the average surface water temperature was between 29.1 degree Celsius and 33 degree Celsius in Mandapam; 29.3 degree Celsius and 33.1 Celsius in Keezhakkari ; and 29.3 degree Celsius to 33.6 degree Celsius in Tuticorin,\u201d J.K. Patterson Edward, Director, SDMRI, told The Hindu. The overall percentage of coral bleaching is 10.6 on the Mandapam coast, while it is 7.5 and 9.3 on Keezhakkarai and Tuticorin coast.\u000a\u000aThe maximum bleaching of 12.50 per cent has been recorded on Shingle Island (Mandapam coast); 9.4 per cent on Appa Island (Keezhakkaari coast) and 14.7 per cent on Kariyachalli Island (Tuticorin coast).\u000a\u000aThe most affected species are branching corals such as like Acropora nobilis, A. formosa, A. cythera, Montipora foliosa, and Pocillopora damicornis and massive corals such as Porites solida and Favia pallida.\u000a\u000aThe partially bleached coral species are Porites lutea, Favia pallida, Favites abditta and Echinopora lamellose. The coral species such as Porites lichen, Goniastrea rectiformis, Favites abditta, Platygyra lamellosa, Hydnopora microconos, Symphyllia recta, Acropora intermedia and Montipora divaricata have started to bleach and if the temperature level prevails, they will be completely bleached soon.\u000a\u000aAmong the bleached coral colonies, 40 per cent are recruits; 35 per cent are of intermediate size; and 25 per cent are large colonies. The bleached corals are in stressful state. They will recover only if the temperature level comes down owing to change of climatic condition.\u000a\u000aWildlife Warder, Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, M. Sundarakumar, said any external disturbance in the form of heavy trawling would destroy the already affected coral reef. \u201cIt is essential that the coral areas should not be disturbed by the fisher folk by any kind of illegal fishing and other activities such as trap fishing, trawling, seaweed collection, shore seine operation, ornamental fish collection etc. The Marine National Park authorities have also intensified the vigil in order to avoid any human disturbance in the reef areas,\u201d Mr. Sundarakumar said.

VNEW DELHI: The BASIC group of India, China, Brazil and South Africa have decided to recast the debate about `climate equity' and will hold a special session on it in the next meeting in Brazil in June.The move by the BASIC nations comes as pressure from the developed countries to junk the principle of `historical responsibility' embedded in the existing UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has increased.The convention at present recognises the fact that developed countries have been primarily responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. With a universally accepted cap on how much GHGs can be emitted in the atmosphere without raising global temperatures, the historical emissions restrict the current space available for developing economies to increase their emissions in order to achieve economic growth.In this context, the embedded principle of `historical responsibility' puts pressure on the developed countries to either vacate the excess carbon budget they continue to occupy or to compensate the developing countries with technologies and funds to find a cleaner route to achieve higher economic levels.While the debate is built on looking at accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere from pre-industrial era when human-induced emissions rapidly increased, academics in the developed world have begun focusing on cutting short the timeline and instead look at emissions from 1990 onwards.Indian negotiators point out that this would imply putting aside the issue of excess carbon space developed countries occupy and talk only of dividing the left over carbon space in the atmosphere. With only a small margin left in the atmosphere before the world breaches the tipping point or accepted GHG cap, they contend it would require India and other emerging economies to make larger cuts in their emissions than is beneficial to the economies.India too is expected to hold a meeting on equity with environment minister Jairam Ramesh having asked a US-based economist to revisit the equity principle.A series of formal and informal meetings are scheduled before that in the international arena where the talks are expected to also hit upon the issue though couched in negotiating jargon.India will be participating in a 45-country meeting called by Mexico, the host of the 2010 meeting, of UN convention members and Germany at Bonn starting on Monday to find common ground on contentious issues like this before the formal UN talks are held in June in Bonn and in November in Cancun.

VThe city may feel like insides of a furnace these days, baking denizens ruthlessly as the mercury continues on its relentless climb, but then there are some cool spaces too. Mostly unnoticed, these 'cool by nature' buildings may help you change your perception about.These are " climate homes" \u2014 offices and institutions in Ahmedabad \u2014 some even almost half a century old that have managed to cut temperatures. Step into these cool zones and you can feel a perceptible temperature drop of 9-12 degrees. In most cases this technology reduces air conditioning costs by 35-45 per cent. Built with a bit of common sense these dwellings tone down harsh climatic effects.If you happen to be in any of the four Le Corbusier's buildings its surprising how well 'Master Corbu' understood the Indian weather. The Sarabhai's house, one of Corbu's creations shows maximum adaptation to harsh climates.The most delightful aspect of this building is a garden on the roof. It is made to feel almost like another level of the ground. Similarly Corbu had made provisions for a roof top garden on AMC's Sanskar Kendra too. American architect Louis Kahn on the other hand in IIM (A) sliced the harsh effect of the sunlight to run down temperatures."This garden helps keep the lower floors cool in summer by 9-10 degrees. The urban development department should give certain relaxation and incentives in building regulations and even help and encourage people construct such homes," says Anand Sarabhai.And, now the old is influencing the new. New-age builders like Sameer Sinha, too, have adopted Corbu's roof top gardens to bring down temperatures in his office."Most of our new office projects have gardens on roofs as a cooling feature. "The electric bills of my office which used to be driven up by AC have dipped by 45%. Cooler office environs means less AC consumption. All our new offices have gardens to prove this point," says president of Indian Green Building Council (Gujarat) Sameer Sinha.Torrent research and development centre on Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar road have a sequence of wind towers that are part of the passive downdraught evaporative cooling (PDEC) system. This involves spraying controlled volumes of microscopic water droplets into hot, dry ambient air, thereby causing it to cool and descend into a capture zone within a building.On another front Sangath office of architect BV Doshi on Drive In road and the Environmental Sanitation Institute in Sughad have natural insulation.Director of Vaastu Shilp foundation, Yatin Pandya, says, "A section of Sangath is literally buried under earth mound which acts as an insulation. The roof is a sandwich \u2014 clay, ceramic fuses and china mosaic. The garden here acts as micro climate regulators. The ESI in Gandhinagar won a national award for sustainable building. Its harvests rain water, has a water cascade channel and utilises reflected light of the sun to bring down temperatures.."Same goes for the ATMA building on Ashram road, another Corbu building on the banks of the Sabarmati. The structure is protected on two sides by brise-soliel \u2014 sun-breakers. It modifies the harsh sun rays and allows breeze from the river.

VWASHINGTON: The year 2010 is turning out to be the warmest ever in recorded history, with the first four months reporting an average temperature of 13.3 degrees Celsius which is 0.69 degrees above the 20th century average.The combined global land and ocean surface temperatures for the period between January and April were the warmest on record, and April was the warmest individual month ever, America's climate agency has said in its latest report.The combined April global land and ocean average surface temperature was the warmest on record at 14.5 degrees Celsius (58.1 degrees F).This is 0.76 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average of 13.7 degrees Celsius, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said.The earth's temperature for January-April at 56.0 degrees Fahrenheit (13.3C), is 1.24 degrees Fahrenheit or (0.69C) above the 20th century average, it said.While the global ocean surface temperature was 0.57 degrees C above the 20th century average of 16 degrees and the warmest on record for April, the global land temperature was 1.29 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average of 8.1, the third warmest on record for April.The report said the warmth was most pronounced in the equatorial portions of major oceans, especially the Atlantic.Warmer-than-normal conditions dominated the globe, with the most prominent warmth in Canada, Alaska, eastern US, Australia, South Asia, northern Africa and northern Russia.Cooler-than-normal places included Mongolia, Argentina, far eastern Russia, the western contiguous United States and most of China, it said.The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a climate pattern that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean on average every five years, weakened in April, as sea-surface temperature anomalies decreased across the equatorial Pacific.The climate pattern is known for its association with floods, droughts and other weather disturbances in many regions of the world, which vary with each event.The weakening contributed significantly to the warmth observed in the tropical belt and the warmth of the overall ocean temperature for April.According to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, El Nio is expected to continue through June.The agency said the Arctic sea ice was below normal for the 11th consecutive April, and 2.1 per cent below the 1979-2000 average extent.

VUNITED NATIONS: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has appointed Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica to be the next head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC )."Ms Figueres is an international leader on strategies to address global climate change and brings to this position a passion for the issue, deep knowledge of the stakeholders and valuable hands-on experience with the public sector, non-profit sector and private sector," Martin Nesirky, Ban's spokesperson said.Figueres, who has served as Costa Rica's lead climate negotiator since 1995, was short-listed along with former South African environment minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk to be interviewed by Ban for the post."I am honoured by the designation of the Secretary General and I am thankful to the members of the UNFCCC bureau for their vote of confidence. Most of all, I am humbled by the opportunity of the challenging task at hand," Figueres said."As I take on my new responsibilities at the helm of the secretariat, I will have two immediate priorities: to work with the Secretary General to strengthen trust in the process, and to support the Danish and Mexican COP Presidencies as well as all other Parties in the preparation of a successful COP16 in Cancun," she added.In July, Figueres will take over from the current director of the UNFCCC, Yvo de Boer of the Netherlands who resigned in February shortly after the unsuccessful climate change conference in December 2009 that yielded the contentious and non-binding Copenhagen Accord.The accord was produced by 29 countries, but principally drafted by the US, China, India, Brazil and South Africa, in the last few hours of the Conference, and was slammed by certain countries including Bolivia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba for having left the majority of the nations out of the negotiating process.Key elements of the accord included a limit 2 degree rise of global temperature, 100 billion dollars on finance in long term finance to developing countries and 30 billion dollars to short-term finance to the poorest and most vulnerable countries.The new UN climate chief has the daunting task of preparing for the climate conference in Cancun later this year, which is expected to produce a legally binding climate change treaty.In Cancun, the developed countries are also expected to pledge carbon cuts for the next commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the only legally binding climate treaty- starting from 2013 since its first commitment period ends in 2012.

VNEW DELHI: The Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change approved the National Water Mission focusing on making water conservation a peoples' movement in the country.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who chaired the meeting of the Council, highlighted the need to create a general consciousness of the need to use water in the most sustainable manner in view of its scarcity and assess the impact of climate change on water.The Council felt that to make the Mission a peoples' movement it was essential to make available all data on water in the public domain to be able to mobilise citizens, local bodies and state governments for focused action on water conservation and augmentation.Given that there are multiple uses of water and in view of need for an integrated approach based on basin development planning, Singh said "political leadership at the local and state level and civil society organisations need to be involved in activities of the Mission."A PMO statement said that the first step in this direction would be to prepare a comprehensive water data base in the public domain and assessing the impact of climate change on water."Action needs to be focused on vulnerable areas, where ground water is overexploited. It was also decided that water use efficiency should be raised by 20 per cent through the promotion of water-positive and water-neutral technologies," the statement added.Members felt incentives should be provided for using water in a sustainable manner and that the Research and Development requirements of the mission should be focused upon.Many members suggested that the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme Act can be utilised to convert water conservation into a peoples movement.Ministers of Finance, Power, Water Resources, Non- Conventional and Renewable Energy Resources, Urban Development, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and Environment and Forest besides members of the Council were present at the meeting.Water Mission is one of the eight missions in the National Action Plan on Climate Change launched by the Prime Minister last year to tackle the threats of global warming.The government has already launched Energy Efficient and Solar Mission while a draft of Green Mission has been prepared for public consultation.

VLONDON: Scientists have claimed that a huge carbon "burp" from deep ocean kick-started global warming at end of the last Ice Age some 18,000 years ago.According to the scientists, the carbon dioxide was actually locked away in the deep ocean "repository" and as the Earth warmed, it was released into the atmosphere causing the global warming and ending the last Ice Age.It is believed that carbon dioxide was dissolved in the waters of the deep ocean during ice ages, and that pulses or "burps" of carbon dioxide from the deep Southern Ocean helped trigger a global thaw every 100,000 years or so, 'The Daily Telegraph' reported.The size of these pulses was roughly equivalent to the change in carbon dioxide experienced since the start of the industrial revolution.Throughout the past two million years, the Earth has alternated between ice ages and warmer climates. These changes are mainly driven by alterations in the Earth's orbit around the sun, but they have been accelerated by changes on the planet's surface, say the scientists.One of those is thought to be the huge storage and then release of carbon dioxide by the oceans."If enough of the deep ocean behaved in the same way, this could help to explain how ocean mixing processes lock up more carbon dioxide during glacial periods," Dr Luke Skinner of the University of Cambridge was quoted as saying.The findings have been published in the latest edition of the 'Science' journal.

VST PETERSBURG: Allegations about global warming processes in the Antarctic have nothing to do with real facts, a Russian polar explorer has said."They are of opportunistic and time-serving character, and have nothing to do with the real weather and climate on the southern continent," Head of Russia's 54th Antarctic expedition Viktor Venderovich told Itar-Tass."The past summer on the south pole was cold and windy, and ice floes in the offshore water failed to melt over the entire season."The atmospheric air temperature near the Vostok station deep on the continent reached the customary minus 70 degrees Centigrade in the summer, and near the Novolazarevskaya station it never exceeded minus 6-8 degrees," he said after staying at the Novolazarevskaya station for a year.The previous winter in the Antarctic, he said, "was remarkable for its unusual severity, with blizzards and snowstorms."The average air temperature was 0.5 degrees lower than usual, and there were too much snow, he said, adding that a "slight warming was registered only on the Antarctic peninsula, while the rest of the continent has not been affected by the global warning and is not going to be."

VArctic ice has reached its lowest point in recent geologic history,reveals a new research.\u000a\u000aThe study appears in Quarternary Science Reviews.\u000a\u000aA team led by Ohio State University re-examined the data from past and ongoing studies \u2013 nearly 300 in all \u2013 and combined them to form a big-picture view of the poles climate history stretching back millions of years.\u000a\u000aLead author Leonid Polyak,a research scientist at Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University,said: The ice loss that we see today \u2014 the ice loss that started in the early 20th Century and sped up during the last 30 years \u2014 appears to be unmatched over at least the last few thousand years. Satellites can provide detailed measures of how much ice is covering the pole right now,but sediment cores are like fossils of the oceans history,he explained.\u000a\u000aPolyak said: Sediment cores are essentially a record of sediments that settled at the sea floor,layer by layer,and they record the conditions of the ocean system during the time they settled. When we look carefully at various chemical and biological components of the sediment,and how the sediment is distributed \u2014 then,with certain skills and luck,we can reconstruct the conditions at the time the sediment was deposited. When we look carefully at various chemical and biological components of the seafloor sediment,and how the sediment is distributed \u2014 then,with certain skills and luck,we can reconstruct the conditions at the time the sediment was deposited. Underneath the surface,the ice can be thick or thin. The newest satellite techniques and field observations allow us to see that the volume of ice is shrinking much faster than its area today. The picture is very troubling. We are losing ice very fast. Maybe sometime down the road well develop proxies for the ice thickness. Right now,just looking at ice extent is very difficult. As scientists pull more sediment cores from the Arctic,Polyak and his collaborators want to understand more details of the past ice extent and to push this knowledge further back in time.\u000a\u000aDuring the summer of 2011,they hope to draw cores from beneath the Chukchi Sea,just north of the Bering Strait between Alaska and Siberia.\u000a\u000aPolyak said: Later on in this cruise,when we venture into the more central Arctic Ocean,we will aim at harvesting cores that go back even farther.\u000a\u000aIf we could go as far back as a million years,that would be perfect.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

VKOLKATA: Rampant construction and poor compensatory plantation are taking a toll on Kolkata's environment. And it has probably never been as stark and quick as in the last year. The city's green cover now stands at a dismal 5%, which is way below the requirement of 15% for metros.In the last 12 months, Kolkata and its adjoining areas have lost more than 5,000 trees to developmental projects, unauthorized chopping and natural causes. The loss is unprecedented, says the forest department . This could have brought the cover further down and has pushed up the carbon count by an alarming 5,500,000 kg per year, the department admitted.According to the National Commission on Urbanization , which compiled the data, open spaces in the city have been vanishing as well. Less than 1% of city space now remains vacant. In north Kolkata, greenery has dipped to 4.79% which is extremely unhealthy, say experts. South Kolkata was marginally greener.The impact of this loss would be felt in the coming years, feel environmentalists. And it could be irreversible, given the sporadic and unplanned compensatory plantation in Kolkata. The figures confirm the fear. As much as 95 lakh tonnes of carbon are generated in Kolkata from vehicular emission every year. Since each full-grown tree can absorb around 1,100 kg of carbon a year, a loss of 5,000 plants means 5,500,000 kg more carbon in the city's atmosphere."The city can't hold this carbon load for long. Other than carbon, trees also absorb a whole lot of pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and suspended particulate matter apart from benzene, lead and arasol. This can turn out to be a major health hazard," said Sudipto Bhattacharya of Saviours and Friends of Environment (SAFE), a green NGO.These pollutants can trigger a whole lot of diseases like asthma, skin allergies, cardiac disorders, loss of memory and diseases of the central nervous system," said Debashish Basu, preventive medicine specialist.Poor compensatory plantation, forest officials say, has contributed generously to the dwindling green count. The rulebook says that for every tree felled, at least five must be planted. Not many have paid heed. The law also says that before a tree is chopped, the forest department must be informed.The latter levies a charge for the felling and gives its sanction only after receiving an undertaking that trees will be planted to neutralize the loss. However, only a few high-profile projects have adhered to the rules.In comparison, the green cover in Delhi and Mumbai are much higher. While the Capital has a cover of 19.09%, Mumbai was marginally behind at around 18%. The national average stands at a healthier 19.49%.The erosion of greenery in the city has also led to a loss of biodiversity. Along with birds that nest in them, trees also play host to species like bats, rhesus monkeys, palm civet cats and squirrels, which have been disappearing from the city proper."An average Kolkata tree attracts around 200 species of insects that depend on it for survival. With each tree being chopped, we are also killing these or dislocating them. Compensatory plantation may help maintain the overall greenery but the loss of biodiversity is permanent," explained Pranabesh Sanyal, environmentalist and former director of Sundarban Tiger Reserve (STR).While the Cyclone Aila felled around 1000 trees, the East-West Metro project resulted in a loss of 700 trees only in Salt Lake. Around a thousand more were axed along VIP Road, BT Road and the EM Bypass. Hundreds of others fell prey to unauthorized chopping. Tarak Mohan Das, former head of the department of botany, Calcutta University , said development projects can be undertaken without chopping off trees."In many foreign cities, roads have been built keeping trees and small saplings in the middle," Das said.Even though the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the forest department claim to have planted 30,000 saplings each every year since 2007, the results have been dismal. Contrary to the claims that 80% of these have survived, NGOs and experts argued that the survival rate was not more than 10%-15%. Maintenance is poor and there is no trace of most of the saplings."The culture of tending to saplings is absent in Kolkata and there is hardly any monitoring. We had distributed 1,100 saplings among various organizations over the last one year as an experiment. When we followed up with them to check if the saplings were still there, we found that none had gone back to the spot," said Bhattacharya.Experts predicted that Kolkata will soon have a few green islands surrounded by large bastions of barren, concrete tracts. "The lopsided distribution of greenery is inevitable. It is better than having a treeless city, but can never compensate for the loss that the environment suffers due to the shrinking green cover," said Sanyal.

VPATNA: In a move to reduce carbon dioxide emission by cutting down the use of fuel-run vehicles, the state government is promoting the use of bicycles, particularly among youths.A special drive, christened "Bihar Cycle Campaign ", has been launched by the department of sports and youth affairs in this regard. It entails organizing bicycle rallies for school and college-going students in each district and awarding winners, both from boys and girls' categories, with attractive gifts. It would be followed by district-level competitions. Winners at this level would participate in a state-level competition where winners would get cycles in award apart from other gifts."The purpose is to promote the use of bicycles among youths, particularly among those who opt for motorbikes and feel shy of using bicycles," sports and youth affairs department secretary Vivek Singh told TOI.Incidentally, one hour of cycling in place of using fuel-run vehicles reduces carbon dioxide emission by about 250 gm. Cycling also helps people in keeping their body in good shape.In a state like Bihar, which has a population of around 10 crore, it can be anybody's guess how much carbon dioxide emission could be cut down even if one-tenth of the population shifts to bicycles for local movement."We can explore the possibility of carbon credit trading if a large number of people shift to cycling. Such a move would help reduce carbon dioxide emission in a big way," the secretary said.Singh said a request has also been made to the Patna divisional commissioner to explore the possibility of earmarking cycle tracks along the main roads in the city for the benefit of cyclists.Plans are also afoot to set up a cycle club in Patna for promoting cycling. To begin with, 10 bicycles would be kept in this club and people would have the facility of "rent a bicycle" by producing genuine identity cards, Singh said.

Oil fields, gas fields, saline formations, unminable coal seams, and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites.\u000a\u000aSigurdur Gislason, of University of Iceland, who is leading an international team of scientists on the \u201cCarbfix Project\u201d for an Icelandic geothermal power plant, presented his findings today at the annual Goldschmidt Conference at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\u000a\u000aGislason\u2019s project aims at pumping carbon deep underground in southwest Iceland where it will mix with minerals and become rock.\u000a\u000aThe project involves capturing and separating flue gases at the Hellisheidi Geothermal Power Plant in Hengill, transporting the gas, dissolving it in water, and injecting it at high pressures to a depth between 400 and 800 meters into a thick layer of basalt. Then the researchers will verify and monitor the storage.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf successful, the experiment will be scaled up and can be used wherever carbon dioxide is emitted,\u201d said Gislason.\u000a\u000aCurrently, carbon may be captured as a byproduct in processes such as petroleum refining. It can be stored in reservoirs, ocean water and mature oilfields.\u000a\u000aCarbon sequestration is currently the most promising way to reduce greenhouse gases and Gislason\u2019s project is aimed at finding a storage solution that is long lasting, thermodynamically stable and environmentally benign.\u000a\u000aThe researchers said that the storage of CO2 as solid magnesium carbonates or calcium carbonates deep underground in basaltic rocks may provide a long-term and thermodynamically stable solution.\u000a\u000aHowever, many experts fear that CO2 may leak over time.

North America and Eurasia both had record-low snow extents for the month.Warm temperatures were present over most of the globe's land areas. The warmest temperature anomalies occurred in eastern North America, eastern Brazil, Eastern Europe, southern Asia, eastern Russia, and equatorial Africa.The Chinese province of Yunnan had its warmest May since 1951. Numerous locations in Ontario, Canada had their warmest May on record. The combined global land and ocean surface temperature for May was the warmest on record, at 0.69C above the 20th century average of 14.8C.The combined global land and ocean average surface temperature for the March-May season was 14.4C, which is the warmest such period on record and 0.73C above the 20th century average of 13.7C.The global land surface temperature for May was 1.04C above the 20th century average of 11.1C -- the warmest on record.

VSINGAPORE - Australia's new leader should ramp up renewable energy use and enshrine tougher energy efficiency standards to fight global warming, leading climate scientists said on Tuesday, describing them as easy policy wins.Australia has struggled to get support for an emissions trading scheme that would put a price on carbon pollution from industry, such as the refining, minerals and mining sectors.Shelving the scheme in April led in part to a plunge in the popularity of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ahead of an election later this year. His deputy Julia Gillard took over as prime minister last week, pledging greater consensus on settinga price on carbon.But Gillard is also expected to announce more steps in favour of green energy and energy efficiency in the world's top coal exporter and major coal consumer, in an effort to win back support from voters expecting more action on climate change."You get much more support for climate policies if you frame them in a positive way and not present them only as constraints but also opportunities," said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, Vice-Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.More investment in public transport and energy efficiency made people's lives easier and cheaper, he told an online media briefing on the sidelines of a major climate change and adaptation conference on the Gold Coast in Queensland."I want (the Australian government) to look at an emissions trading scheme because eventually you have to have a price on carbon or you don't send a market signal," said Stephen Schneider of Stanford University in California . "But markets aren't the only thing," he told reporters.FIGHTING FLOODS, DROUGHTS"I think if you follow the role of California or Japan , which have implemented mandatory building codes for windows and insulation and refrigerators and air conditioning \u2013 the average person is going to save money and you're going to reduce your carbon footprint.""Do that first because that way you get a win win," he said. Australia has already passed laws mandating 20 percent of electricity must be generated from renewable sources by 2020 and is looking at steps to ramp up energy efficiency. But analysts say more can be done to curb the nation's appetite for coal, oil and gas that makes it one of the developed world's highest per-capita greenhouse gas polluters.The scientists also pointed to the need to better integrate efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions with adapting to climate change impacts such as rising seas, coastal erosion, threat to crops from changes in rainfall patterns and mass extinction.Overall, the planet has already warmed about 0.8 degrees Celsius since the 19th century and scientists blame emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation as the main causefor the temperature rise. Scientists say some impacts such as rising seas and more ntense droughts and floods are inevitable given the sharp rise in planet-warming carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.But there was a limit to how you could adapt economies to these impacts if emissions kept rising, scientists say. "What I keep arguing is, don't think about next year, think about the whole century. Because over that time frame, if the climate starts going up towards (a rise of 3 to 5 deg C by 2100), which is where we're headed, then we have the problem where adaptation becomes almost impossible," Schneider said.

Followed by a low-cost housing programme. Now the Tata group is planning to repeat the success in the power sector.\u000a\u000aTata Power, India\u2019s largest private sector power company, is considering several low-cost solutions to the severe power shortage experienced across the country.\u000a\u000aThe company is set to test a 2 kwh (kilowatt per hour) micro wind turbine that is one of the smallest in the world. A 60 watt light bulb for one hour consumes 0.06 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity and the wind turbine will have the capacity to power a small home for the entire day. To top it, the turbine can be mounted on rooftops.\u000a\u000aIf that doesn\u2019t sound innovative enough, how about generating power from rice husk as fuel? will instal a 250 kw power generation system that will run on rice husk at the Tata hydro power plant near Karjat in Maharashtra. The company hopes to get this pilot project up and running by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur objective is to establish a model for rural India that can have mass usage at low cost. We still feel that decentralised biomass-based solutions are a good option to power rural India,\u201d said Prasad Menon, managing director of \u201cHowever, aggregation of biomass remains a challenge that needs to be effectively addressed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is the reason why is looking at hydro, waste gases, wind, solar, and geothermal as the future green power avenues,\u201d he said. The company is also looking at green technologies like enhanced geothermal systems and coal beneficiation to use on a large commercial scale.\u000a\u000aLike the \u2018micro\u2019 wind turbine project, the company will also experiment with a 35 kw wind turbine mounted on a blimp that will float 333 metres above the ground. The concept of a high altitude wind turbine is to catch the winds that are more intense and sustained at that height.\u000a\u000aTata Power, which holds 49 per cent stake in the joint venture Tata BP Solar, which is India\u2019s largest solar company in India, is setting up a concentrated photo voltaic (C-PV) 13.5kw pilot unit on the Walwhan lake in Maharashtra.\u000a\u000aIn this technology, sun rays are concentrated on PV cells and are cooled to generate power. If successful, this technology can be scaled up across all lakes that provide hydro power to Tata plants in west Maharashtra, generating about 1,000 mega watt (Mw), said company sources.\u000a\u000aIndia has about 50,000 telecom towers which are run on diesel gensets that provide power to their antennaes. So far, Tata BP Solar has successfully implemented solar powered telecom towers in about 25 installations, replacing diesel powered gensets. The company has also electrified about 500 remote rural bank branches across several banks, including Bank of Baroda, and at many rural co-operative banks.\u000a\u000aThe Tatas are also planning a mega solar initiative, to start from within the group itself. Tata Power has installed about 20 Mw of solar power, utilising the roof tops of other Tata Group Group companies, numbering over 100 and with numerous plants and offices worldwide, may switch over to solar power.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur preliminary study shows that there is substantial potential to exploit this opportunity from within the group itself and are currently working on it and implement the same as soon as the overall policy framework is in place,\u201d said Menon.\u000a\u000aThe company is in the process of setting up a 3 Mw photovoltaic grid connected plant in Mulshi in the Western Ghats. This will be one of the largest grid-connected solar plants in Maharashtra. Further, it is also implementing a 50 Mw plant in Mithapur in Gujarat, which will be the largest single solar photovoltaic installation in the country.\u000a\u000aTata Power terms these initiatives as part of its sustainability agenda, as the company has set an ambitious target of cutting its carbon footprint by half within 15 years and turning carbon neutral by 2050.

VLONDON: In a relief to the industrialised nations, a Dutch environment report has blamed high growth in China and India for the rise in carbon emissions , saying they have "completely nullified" the reductions achieved by rich nations.The global CO2 emissions have remained constant in 2009 despite the economic crisis slowing down the growth trajectory of many countries, Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency (PBL) said in a report yesterday.The agency, which had identified that China's carbon emissions in 2006 had overshot that of the US, making it the world's largest polluter, attributed the 2009 trend to an offset effect by China and India."... strong increases in CO2 emissions from fast-growing developing countries, such as China and India, have completely nullified CO2 emission reductions in the industrialised world," the report said.The figures will come as a relief to the world's rich countries , which, apart from the US, are legally committed to reducing emissions by a collective 5.2 per cent on 1990 figures by 2012, the report said. This is for the first time since 1992 that the emissions of the main greenhouse gas have remained constant.The PBL's report "No growth in total global CO2 emissions in 2009" is based on calculations on recent data from sources including data on energy use from oil company British Petroleum (BP), on cement production from the US Geological Survey (USGS), and on the latest version of the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR).The calculations show that emissions from fossil-fuel combustion in the industrial countries have decreased by seven per cent. But in China and India, they actually increased by nine and six per cent respectively.The report trashes earlier projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicting an emission decrease for 2009 of 2.6 per cent - the largest in 40 years.While the industrialised nations seem to be on course to achieve the Kyoto Protocol targets -- aided in part by the meltdown -- the fast growing economies have been unable to rein in emissions.However, "a large part of production capacity that has been suspended (due to the economic crisis), could be re-employed as soon as the economy improves," it says.Both China and India had pledged ambitious target cuts ahead of last year's Copenhagen climate change summit.While Beijing promised to curb its emission intensity by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, India announced a target reduction of 20-25 per cent by 2020 on the 2005 levels.The report also pointed out that although there have been strong increases in emissions in countries such as China and India, their average CO2 emissions per inhabitant, in 2009, were still below those in industrial countries.

VAn international expert consultation on climate change impact on Cryosphere of the Indus Basin and its implications on future water scenario has begun here at headquarter of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepali capital Kathmandu on Friday. An expert consultation organized by ICIMOD has brought together international as well as regional researchers from different disciplines and geographic region. Workshop will discuss over the establishment of an \u201cIndus River Basin Initiative\u201d to coordinate collaboration between different institutions and organisations.\u000a\u000aThe Indus River Basin will collect and analyse recent and ongoing research interventions and approaches. It will also provide platform for sharing knowledge gained from this analysis as well as for sharing current state-of-the-art approaches and interventions planned for future work on climate change and water resource management in the Indus River Basin, according to ICIMOD.\u000a\u000aDuring the workshop, presentations and discussions will focus on study design and methodologies used in field work, modelling, and scenario analysis. The Indus River Basin is one of the most sensitive basins to impacts of climate change on water supplies and loss of livelihoods. Runoff is generated predominantly by melting snow and ice, and a large number of economic activities and human lives in the basin.\u000a\u000aThe Indus Basin covers an area of about 1,140,000 sq. km. A large part of the upper basin lies within the Hindu Kush, Karakorum,and Himalayan mountains. Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan share the basin territory, according to ICIMOD.

VA man swims in a fountain outside the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, Friday, July 16, 2010. A heat wave hit central Russia with temperatures rising above 30C (86F) breaking temperature records. (AP Photo/Sergey Ponomarev) | Photo Credit: Sergey Ponomarev\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aAfter a freezing winter, Russia is baking in sweltering heat of a record-hot summer.\u000a\u000aTemperatures in the mid-30s Centigrade may be routine for India, but are extraordinary for Russia. On Friday Moscow registered an all-time record temperature of 33 degrees C; more records are likely to be broken over the weekend, when the weather service forecasts up to 37 degrees C.\u000a\u000aElsewhere in Russia the heat is even more scorching. Seventeen regions from the Urals to Siberia have declared a state of emergency as temperatures have soared to 40 degrees Celsius or higher and there has been no rain for weeks.\u000a\u000aRussia is facing the worst drought in 130 years. It has so far destroyed crops on 20 per cent of the land sown, causing world wheat prices to spike to a 13-month high on Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe hot summer came in the wake of a deep freeze that hit Russia last winter, when temperatures in some regions dropped below minus 50 degrees C. While the winter frosts caused municipal water pipes laid two metres below surface to freeze and burst, the summer heat is melting asphalt on Russian roads. About 900 trucks have been pouring cold water on the streets of Moscow two to three times a day in an effort to stop asphalt from softening and causing traffic accidents. Authorities have also begun emergency road repairs, replacing regular asphalt with a hastily developed brand that can withstand higher temperatures.\u000a\u000aMore than 1,000 Russians seeking relief from heat in lakes and rivers have been drowned in recent months. A majority of those drowned were drunk as Russians refuse to give up booze even in scorching weather, officials said.\u000a\u000aThe heat has taken its toll on the Kremlin, with traditional weekly parades of presidential honour guards cancelled because of the weather.\u000a\u000aAn ambulance has been placed on duty outside the Kremlin after an elderly Japanese tourist died at the gates apparently from a heatstroke.\u000a\u000aU.S. climate scientists said on Thursday that June was the warmest month across the globe in record, keeping the planet on a course for a hot year.

VDavid Breashears is one of Americas legendary mountain climbers,a man who has climbed Mount Everest five times and led the Everest IMAX film team in 1996. These days,Breashears is still climbing the Himalayas,but he is lugging more than pitons and ice axes. Hes also carrying special cameras to document stunning declines in glaciers on the roof of the world.\u000a\u000aBreashears first reached the top of Everest in 1983,and in many subsequent trips to the region he noticed the topography changing,the glaciers shrinking. So he dug out archive photos from early Himalayan expeditions,and then journeyed across ridges and crevasses to photograph from the exact same spots. The pairs of matched photographs,old and new,are staggering. Time and again,the same glaciers have shrunk drastically in every direction,often losing hundreds of feet in height.\u000a\u000aI was just incredulous, he told me. We took measurements with laser rangefinders to measure the loss of height of the glaciers. The drop was often the equivalent of a 35- or 40-story building. Breashears led me through a display of these paired photographs at the Asia Society in New York. One 1921 photo by George Mallory,the famous mountaineer who died near the summit of Everest three years later,shows the Main Rongbuk Glacier. Breashears located the very spot from which Mallory had snapped that photo and took another  only it is a different scene,because the glacier has lost 330 feet of vertical ice.\u000a\u000aSome research in social psychology suggests that our brains are not well adapted to protect ourselves from gradually encroaching harms. We evolved to be wary of sabre-toothed tigers and blizzards,but not of climate change  and maybe thats also why we in the news media tend to cover weather but not climate. The upshot is that were horrifyingly nonchalant at the prospect that rising carbon emissions may devastate our favourite planet.\u000a\u000aNASA says that the January-through-June period this year was the hottest globally since measurements began in 1880. Likewise,the Global Snow Lab at Rutgers University says that the months of May and June had the lowest snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere since the lab began satellite observations in 1967. So signs of danger abound,but we seem unable to rouse ourselves.\u000a\u000aWeve watched with glazed eyes as glaciers have retreated worldwide. Glacier National Park now has only about 25 glaciers,compared with around 150 a century ago. In the Himalayas,the shrinkage seems to be accelerating,with Chinese scientific measurements suggesting that some glaciers are now losing up to 26 feet in height per year. Orville Schell,who runs China programmes at the Asia Society,described passing a series of pagodas as he approached the Mingyong Glacier on the Tibetan plateau. The pagodas were viewing platforms,and had to be rebuilt as the glacier retreated: this monumental,almost eternal force of nature seemed mortally wounded.\u000a\u000aAn Indian glaciologist,Syed Iqbal Hasnain,now at the Stimson Center in Washington,told me that most Himalayan glaciers are in retreat for three reasons. First is the overall warming tied to carbon emissions. Second,rain and snow patterns are changing,so that less new snow is added to replace what melts. Third,pollution from trucks and smoke covers glaciers with carbon soot so that their surfaces become darker and less reflective  causing them to melt more quickly.\u000a\u000aThe retreat of the glaciers threatens agriculture downstream. A study published last month in Science magazine indicated that glacier melt is essential for the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers,while less important a component of the Ganges,Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The potential disappearance of the glaciers,the report said,is threatening the food security of an estimated 60 million people in the Indus and Brahmaputra basins.\u000a\u000aWe Americans have been galvanised by the oil spill on our gulf coast,because we see tar balls and dead sea birds as visceral reminders of our hubris in deep sea drilling.\u000a\u000aThe melting glaciers should be a similar warning of our hubris  and of the consequences that the earth will face for centuries unless we address carbon emissions today.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

VUnder-water shots of coral formations. Scientists claim to have found evidence that microscopic organisms in the ocean influence global climate through ecological interactions and responses. File Photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aFor the first time, scientists claim to have found evidence that microscopic organisms in the ocean influence global climate through ecological interactions and responses.\u000a\u000aAn international team has found that the interactions of microscopic organisms around a particular organic material alter the chemical properties of the ocean and also influence global climate by affecting cloud formation in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIn the \u2018Science\u2019 journal, team member Justin Seymour of University of Technology Sydney has described how a relative of the smelly chemical that sea birds and seals use to locate prey -- dimethylsulfide (DMS) -- may serve a similar purpose at the microbial scale, helping marine microorganisms find food and cycle chemicals that are important to climate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that ecological interactions and behavioural responses taking place within volumes of a fraction of a drop of seawater can ultimately influence important ocean chemical cycling processes,\u201d Seymour said.\u000a\u000aUsing microfluidic technology, the scientists, led by Prof Roman Stocker of Massachusetts Institute of Technology recorded microbes swimming toward dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) as the chemical was released into tiny channel occupied by the microbes.\u000a\u000aThe fact that the microbes actively moved toward the DMSP indicates that the tiny organisms play a role in ocean sulphur and carbon cycles, which exert a powerful influence on Earth\u2019s climate.\u000a\u000aHow fast the microorganisms consume DMSP is important as DMS is involved in formation of clouds in the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThis in turn affects the heat balance of the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aThe research is the first to make a visual record of microbial behaviour in the presence of DMSP.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to directly look at an environment in order to understand its ecology. We can now visualize the behaviour of marine microorganisms much like ecologists have done with macro-organisms for a long time,\u201d Stocker said.\u000a\u000aTo do this, the team recreated a microcosm of the ocean environment using a microfluidic device about the size of a flash drive with minuscule channels engraved in a clear rubbery material.\u000a\u000aThe scientists injected DMSP into the channel in a way that mimics the bursting of an algal cell after viral infection -- a common event in the ocean -- then, using a camera attached to a microscope, they recorded whether and how microbes swam towards the chemical.\u000a\u000aThe scientists found that some marine microbes, including bacteria, are attracted to DMSP because they feed on it, whereas others are drawn to the chemical as it signals the presence of prey.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy simulating the microscale patches of the chemical cue and directly monitoring the swimming responses of the predators towards these patches, we get a much more accurate perception of these important ecological interactions than can be obtained from traditional approaches,\u201d they said.

VUS environmental regulators on Thursday rejected a series of challenges to the science behind climate change, reaffirming that global warming is real and the result of man-made pollution.\u000a\u000aThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruling was welcomed by US climate groups and comes after a number of recent controversies over the workings of climate scientists provided fodder for sceptics around the world.\u000a\u000aThe EPA reaffirmed its 2009 "endangerment finding", which for the first time declared climate change a threat to public health and could serve as a basis for the US government taking action to reduce pollution.\u000a\u000aOpponents had argued that the "Climategate" scandal, involving errors discovered in a 2007 international climate report and emails leaked last year from a British university, had placed in doubt the science behind climate change.\u000a\u000aThe EPA rejected 10 separate challenges to its endangerment finding. EPA chief Lisa Jackson said that the ruling was "based on years of science from the US and around the world".\u000a\u000aThe finding allows the agency to move ahead with specific actions to reduce US emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming, including new limits on pollution from vehicles. Critics argue the EPA is acting without the approval of lawmakers, who are locked in a fierce debate over the direction of US climate policy.\u000a\u000a"It is time to move beyond this year's contrived controversies over climate science," said Eileen Claussen, head of the US-based Pew Centre on Global Climate Change.\u000a\u000a

VSixty-five days before the Commonwealth Games begin in October, right to information (RTI) applications filed by HT questioning the benefit of replacing streetlights, revealed Delhi spent Rs 378 crore on new streetlights that consume more energy than their predecessors.\u000a\u000aBoth the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) have admitted their electricity bill will increase because the new bulbs are more powerful and offer higher illumination.\u000a\u000aThe RTI findings are in contrast to the climate change action plan \u2014 that entails energy efficiency \u2014 adopted by the Capital ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit in December 2009.\u000a\u000aThe PWD, whose share of the project amounts to Rs 198 crore, stopped short of revealing the change in its average electricity bill, saying it would depend on the number of fittings and hours of operation.\u000a\u000aThe MCD, that accounts for Rs 180 crore of the project, was more candid: The average annual electricity bill for each streetlight would be around Rs 9,600. There is no comparison with earlier streetlights as records are not available. Officials secretly admitted the increase could be 10-15 per cent.\u000a\u000aThe idea was to get worldclass streetlights at minimal cost, a Delhi government official told HT. Each streetlight costs around Rs 1.20 lakh.\u000a\u000aKolkata and Guwahati that opted for a similar project, under the guidance of Bureau of Energy Efficiency unlike Delhi, will pay less. Kolkata opted for LED lamps at double the cost of a normal streetlight that save 50 per cent more energy.

VNEW DELHI: From green concerts to kiosks to calculating the carbon footprints that you leave behind in your everyday life - the organising committee is going all out to ensure that common citizens become a part of its Green Games campaign.On Thursday, the OC flagged off the Low Carbon Campaign for the Commonwealth Games 2010 in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Helping the OC put together the initiative was Global Environment Facility, an international organisation.The project aims to develop and promote Low Carbon Campaign for the Commonwealth Games 2010, as a way of inducing behavioural change amongst the citizens, athletes and visitors during the Games. The adoption of these green practices would go a long way towards reducing not only the CWG 2010 carbon footprint but also the city's.As part of the initiative, a host of programmes have been scheduled. Like green music concerts, low-carbon fairs, plantation drive along the Queen's Baton drive, as well as developing public service messages, Shera pop-ups, radio messages on environmental and energy issues linking low-carbon practices with sports and sportsmen spirit.A series of activities in Delhi and NCR has also been planned, which include campaigns on waste and transport, setting up 20 carbon kiosks and carbon footprint calculators, etc. In addition, Global Environment Fund through its small grants programme for NGOs and CBOs is encouraging citizens to enjoy and adopt the spirit of green sports through plantation activities and trainings in schools.The other project partners include the Union ministry of environment and forests, Union ministry of new and renewable energy sources, Bureau of Energy Efficiency, department of environment, government of NCT Delhi, Centre for Media Studies and Centre for Environment Education.

The green supply chain strategy for soda ash is the first for any chemical company in India.\u000a\u000aTata Chemicals will ensure that the transportation of loose soda ash is undertaken by Lupa bulkers worth Rs 45 lakh.\u000a\u000aSpecially designed bulk freighters\u000a\u000aThe bulk freighters are specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo and are mounted on trucks. It is a vessel used to load and unload cargo through air pressure. Soda ash is transported worldwide in loose conditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe significance of this bulker is that it primarily helps to reduce Co2 emissions as the use of plastic bags are avoided altogether,\u201d said a company representative.\u000a\u000aThe bulker is already in operation at Tata Chemicals\u2019 Mithapur plant in Gujarat. Each bulker has an approximate capacity of 25 tonnes and can replace three million plastic bags each year.\u000a\u000aThe company plans to incorporate 10 more bulkers in FY12-13.\u000a\u000aThough it brings on ease of operation, with a pressurised discharge and no possibility of contamination, it is also cost effective and economical in a limited radius to the supplier and receiver.\u000a\u000aMeher Hermanns, which is present in India for the last 12 years, makes the Lupa bulkers. The company is an Indian arm of Hermanns Silo GmbH, Germany.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s comprehensive international structure tackles bulk material handling.\u000a\u000aTypically in the chemicals industry, most bulk chemicals are transported in a packed form, whereas some of the liquid chemicals are transported in tankers. \u201cIn the near-term, we are targeting 1,50,000 mt of movement of soda ash by bulkers which will help in Co2 reduction, since there will be no usage of plastic bags and material handling equipment. We are also planning other alternate and innovative modes for long distance bulk movement of soda ash,\u201d said Zarir Langrana, COO, Tata Chemicals.\u000a\u000aTata Chemicals is working on long-term sustainability goals with annual targets. On carbon footprint, the goal is to achieve 20 per cent reduction in carbon intensity of its products by 2020.\u000a\u000a> amritanair.ghaswalla@thehindu.co.in

VThe United States assured international negotiators Monday it remains committed to reducing carbon emissions over the next 10 years, despite the collapse of efforts to legislate a climate bill.\u000a\u000aU.S. delegate Jonathan Pershing told a climate conference in Bonn, Germany, Washington is not backing away from President Barack Obama's pledge to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels. Pershing said legislation is the preferred way to control greenhouse gases, but the administration "will use all the tools available" to reach its target.\u000a\u000aObama made the pledge at a climate summit in Copenhagen last December, and affirmed it in a formal note to the U.N. climate secretariat. At the time, the U.S. House of Representatives had passed a climate bill and the Senate had been broadly expected to follow suit.\u000a\u000aBut the withdrawal of a scaled down climate bill last week in the Senate raised concern about America's commitment to fight global warming and disappointed developing countries that had hoped Obama would seize international leadership on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe European Union said the failure of the bill encumbered its talks among its own 27 member states on whether the EU should increase its pledge to rein in the gases blamed for global warming. "It hasn't made the discussion and the debate any easier in Europe," Artur Runge-Metzger, the European Commissioner for climate change.\u000a\u000aThe EU has promised to cut emissions by 20 percent below 1990 over the next decade, but said it would raise its target to 30 percent if the U.S. and other major polluters adopt similarly tough goals.\u000a\u000aDelegations from 178 countries began five days of work Monday, resuming painstaking discussions on an agreement to limit global emissions and prepare poor countries for the effects of a warming world.\u000a\u000aDelegates pointed to the lethal floods in Pakistan as an example of a the extreme weather events that scientists say will become more common as average temperatures rise.\u000a\u000aAs if to underscore the global warming threat, U.N. officials lifted the coat-and-tie rules for the week, citing soaring temperatures in Bonn and a desire to lower the air conditioning to reduce the conference's emissions.\u000a\u000aOne more round of talks is scheduled in Tianjin, China, in October before the next major climate conference Nov. 29-Dec 10 in Cancun, Mexico.\u000a\u000aAcknowledged widespread concern over the U.S. position, Pershing said many delegates had asked him about the status of its pledge and the chances of a deal in Cancun.\u000a\u000a"Success in Cancun does not hinge on U.S. legislation," he told some 3,000 delegates, businessmen and activists attending the talks. Environmental groups warned that the setback in Washington should not deter other countries, and called on the EU to take the lead.\u000a\u000a"Parties should not allow U.S. domestic politics to lower the overall level of ambition of an international agreement," said Manuel Oliva, of Conservation International.\u000a\u000aA study by World Resources Institute said the Obama administration could reach the 17 percent goal without passing a sweeping climate bill by using existing powers, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency; by issuing new regulations and executive orders; and through piecemeal energy legislation, Oliva said.\u000a\u000aThe talks in Bonn and Tianjin aim to prepare a successor agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which calls on industrial countries to reduce emissions but makes no demands of developing countries like China and India, which are now among the largest polluters.\u000a\u000aThe United States rejected Kyoto as imbalanced and unfair, but said it will join a new climate regime as long as it is "symmetrical," encompassing all major emitters. The emissions-controlling terms of the Kyoto accord expire in 2012, a deadline that has delegates worried about leaving a vacuum unless a new agreement is in place, the so-called Kyoto gap. Negotiations have stumbled along for 2 years.\u000a\u000aThe original intention was to seal an agreement in Copenhagen, but that summit of 120 world leaders in the Danish capital only managed to agree on a brief political statement of intentions.\u000a\u000aThe top U.N. climate official, Christiana Figueres, said it may be unnecessary to complete a full agreement in Cancun. It was up to the countries to decide whether they want to make it legally binding or a series of less enforceable decisions.\u000a\u000aBut she said by the Cancun conference begins wealthy countries should have made the first payment of a $30 billion three-year promise of emergency climate funds to poor countries.\u000a\u000a"Developing nations see the allocation of this money as a critical signal that industrialized nations are committed to progress in the broader negotiations," said Figueres.

VThe 16th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is due to begin in less than four months from now, at Cancun, Mexico. As yet there are very few indications of significant milestones being achieved at that meeting. There are some who believe that the outcome of Cancun might turn out to be somewhat similar to the lack of strong steps forward witnessed last year at the 15th COP in Copenhagen.\u000a\u000aFor several months now there has been an expectation that the Senate of the United States would pass, in some form, a proposed bill that was introduced largely through the initiative of Senator John Kerry. However, this piece of legislation has not made any progress and for a variety of reasons most observers believe that perhaps legislation will not take place in the US till after the Congressional elections due to take place in November this year. After that what happens would depend largely on the political complexion of Congress as it emerges with a large number of new members.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, there are those officials in the administration who believe that much can be done through action by the executive branch of the government, particularly given the powers that the judiciary has provided to the United States Environment Protection Authority (USEPA). A very clear regulation to improve the energy efficiency of automobiles in the US is already in place. Another area where improvements in energy efficiency are economically viable is in the building sector. In fact, there are significant differences in energy efficiency of same-size buildings and for somewhat similar climates as between some countries of Europe and the US. A programme of incentives and disincentives could bring about an early and substantial improvement in energy efficiency in buildings in the US and, therefore, there could be a significant reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly specifies that the most effective instrument for bringing about mitigation of GHGs would be placing a price on carbon. A substitute for this would, of course, be a set of incentives, disincentives and regulatory requirements that could achieve similar results in the short term.\u000a\u000aThere is currently a growing concern on the possibility of a gap developing between the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and the beginning of the second. The first period would be terminated at the end of 2012. However, if there is no agreement on actions to be taken in the second commitment period then clearly there is a possibility of the second period coming into force after a gap of time. It is with this in view that a proposal has now been introduced for discussion and possible action, by which some of the rigid requirements of the original version of the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 which is currently in force \u2014 would be modified to allow flexibility in countries joining and exiting the Protocol as an agreement emerges for the second commitment period. All this is being proposed essentially to see that an agreement is in place well before the end of 2012 and with adequate provision of time for the second commitment period coming into force without a gap.\u000a\u000aWhile a global agreement has enormous significance for protecting the global commons, such as the earth\u2019s atmosphere which today is characterised by a rapid increase in the concentration of GHGs, action at the local level across the globe is now becoming increasingly imperative. The likelihood is that through widespread awareness on the likely impacts of climate change in different parts of the globe and the means by which mitigation of GHGs can take place, substantial action can be triggered at the local level across the globe. These actions will also create adequate confidence and a substantive basis to facilitate an agreement being reached at the global level.\u000a\u000aOne reason for expecting initiatives by communities and societies irrespective of any global agreement lies in the enormous co-benefits that would accrue from reduced GHG emissions. This is likely to happen because those actions which reduce these emissions, such as higher levels of energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy and a major increase in exploitation of renewable resources of energy, would also carry several attendant benefits. These would be in the nature of lower levels of air pollution at the local level which would create a range of health benefits, higher levels of energy security globally, higher employment, such as through projects based on renewable sources of energy and higher agricultural productivity which would ensure higher food security.\u000a\u000aThere is now growing evidence based on long-term observations which indicates that there is an increase in the intensity and frequency of floods, droughts, heat waves and extreme precipitation events. Public concern on this is also growing. It is not merely based on dissemination of the results of the AR4 but also as a consequence of observations by communities themselves on trends in changes of the climate systems which they are witnessing. The media, of course, has an important responsibility in spreading the results of scientific assessments, both in respect of the impacts of climate change and related adaptation measures as well as on opportunities and benefits associated with mitigation. It would, therefore, be reasonable to assume that understanding the human and economic costs of inaction and the net benefits from action would certainly create responses at the grassroots level that in the aggregate would provide the basis for a global agreement.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, it is important that the negotiators who are engaged in coming up with a future agreement, particularly in respect of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, devise practical and flexible approaches by which the second period is not delayed and does actually come into force by January 1, 2013. The world now has adequate experience in devising appropriate agreements that ensure a fair and effective response to the challenge of climate change across the globe and across all societies \u2014 an agreement that would hold and can be brought into force by a sizeable majority of nations.\u000a\u000aDr R.K. Pachauri is the director-general of The Energy & Resources Institute (TERI), chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and director of the Yale Climate and Energy Institute

VKolkata: Meet the green traveller on a global mission.He has crossed 22,000 km in a wonder van without using a drop of diesel or any other fossil fuel. His van, fitted with a solar panel roof, runs on bio-fuel and aims to produce the least possible carbon footprint while going around the world. Andy Pag, a British mechanical engineer-cum-renewable energy exponent who reached Kolkata on Sunday, says largescale use of bio-diesel can make the carbon emission target of 2 tonnes per capita per year achievable.To reduce the risk of a 5?C rise in global temperatures from 50% to 3%, experts have agreed to reduce CO2 emissions to 2 tonnes per person per year by 2050. "Currently, the carbon footprint per capita per year in the UK is 10-12 tonnes per capita per year and 15-18 tonnes in the US. A massive development spree in India and China and explosion of automobiles have suddenly pushed it beyond 5-6 tonnes per capita per year from less than 2 tonnes in these two countries. As India and China have large populations, the impact is quite telling," said Andy Pag at Emami Tower, which houses Emami Biotech, the biggest producer of bio-diesel in eastern India.The bio-truck expedition, as Andy's trip is known, seeks to find out how other people are cutting their footprint while travelling on a "sustainable carbon budget" himself.Andy rebuilt his vehicle from "rubbish". He designed it to suit his needs with a 1,200-litre tank and filter to reduce viscosity of waste vegetable oil recycled from restaurants and individual kitchens. His solar panel ensures that his refrigerator runs uninterrupted and he gets enough light to study at night and charge his laptop."Europe has a very efficient network of recycling of waste oil from individual kitchens and restaurants. New ideas on sources of waste are being developed as commercial projects in the quest to meet the demand. Uptown Oils, one of my sponsors, is working with sewer grease, which has to be scraped out of drains," said Andy.However, the trip hasn't been as smooth as Andy had thought. Unaware of the laws of countries he passed through, his satellite phone landed him in jail once. "The experience in jail was quite enlightening," Andy wrote on his blog. "This court case has cost me Euro 6,000 while I spent about Euro 3,000 on three months of travel from the UK to India, which was meant to be one of the cheaper legs of the journey. My contingency cash has been wiped out." Also, his vehicle's windscreen was shattered by drunkards a couple of times.He left London on September 19 last year and crossed the English Channel. From France, it has been a long and eventful journey. "I travelled through Italy, Croatia, Turkey , war-ravaged Iran, Pakistan and entered India through Punjab on December 22. In Pakistan, I got an army escort to travel though Balochistan," he said.At Emami Tower, Andy filled up his tank, which he thinks would take care of his journey through Indonesia and Australia. "I strongly feel that India should clear all obstacles to commercial use of bio-diesel. This would be a great leap forward in reducing its carbon footprint." Andy is expected to leave Kolkata on August 10."Though the ministry of renewable energy is pushing for its use, the ministry of petroleum is creating stumbling blocks for its commercial use. So far, all bio-diesel plants in the nation are idle, thanks to the government's policies," said Aditya Agarwal , director of Emami Group of Industries.

VTheory suggests that a world warming up because of those gases will feature heavier rainstorms in summer, bigger snowstorms in winter, more intense droughts in at least some places and more record-breaking heat waves. Scientists and government reports say the statistical evidence shows that much of this is starting to happen.\u000a\u000aBut the averages do not necessarily make it easier to link specific weather events, like a given flood or hurricane or heat wave, to climate change. Most climate scientists are reluctant to go that far, noting that weather was characterized by remarkable variability long before humans began burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you ask me as a person, do I think the Russian heat wave has to do with climate change, the answer is yes,\u201d said Gavin Schmidt, a climate researcher with NASA in New York. \u201cIf you ask me as a scientist whether I have proved it, the answer is no \u2014 at least not yet.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Russia, that kind of scientific caution might once have been embraced. Russia has long played a reluctant, and sometimes obstructionist, role in global negotiations over limiting climate change, perhaps in part because it expected economic benefits from the warming of its vast Siberian hinterland.\u000a\u000aBut the extreme heat wave, and accompanying drought and wildfires, in normally cool central Russia seems to be prompting a shift in thinking.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone is talking about climate change now,\u201d President Dmitri A. Medvedev told the Russian Security Council this month. \u201cUnfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past.\u201d\u000a\u000aThermometer measurements show that the earth has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began pumping enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. For this January through July, average temperatures were the warmest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Friday.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe warming has moved in fits and starts, and the cumulative increase may sound modest. But it is an average over the entire planet, representing an immense amount of added heat, and is only the beginning of a trend that most experts believe will worsen substantially.\u000a\u000aIf the earth were not warming, random variations in the weather should cause about the same number of record-breaking high temperatures and record-breaking low temperatures over a given period. But climatologists have long theorized that in a warming world, the added heat would cause more record highs and fewer record lows.\u000a\u000aThe statistics suggest that is exactly what is happening. In the United States these days, about two record highs are being set for every record low, telltale evidence that amid all the random variation of weather, the trend is toward a warmer climate.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\u000a\u000aClimate-change skeptics dispute such statistical arguments, contending that climatologists do not know enough about long-range patterns to draw definitive links between global warming and weather extremes. They cite events like the heat and drought of the 1930s as evidence that extreme weather is nothing new. Those were indeed dire heat waves, contributing to the Dust Bowl, which dislocated millions of Americans and changed the population structure of the United States.\u000a\u000aBut most researchers trained in climate analysis, while acknowledging that weather data in parts of the world are not as good as they would like, offer evidence to show that weather extremes are getting worse.\u000a\u000aA United States government report published in 2008 noted that \u201cin recent decades, most of North America has been experiencing more unusually hot days and nights, fewer unusually cold days and nights, and fewer frost days. Heavy downpours have become more frequent and intense.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe statistics suggest that the Eastern United States may be getting wetter as the arid West dries out further. Places that depend on the runoff from spring snow melt appear particularly vulnerable to climate change, because higher temperatures are making the snow melt earlier, leaving the ground parched by midsummer. That can worsen any drought that develops.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlobal warming, ironically, can actually increase the amount of snow you get,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \u201cBut it also means the snow season is shorter.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn general, the research suggests that global warming will worsen climate extremes across much of the planet. As in the United States, wet areas will get wetter, the scientists say, while dry areas get drier.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aBut the patterns are not uniform; changes in wind and ocean circulation could cause unexpected effects, with some areas even cooling down in a warmer world. And long-established weather patterns, like the periodic variations in the Pacific Ocean known as El Nio, will still contribute to unusual events, like heavy rains and cool temperatures in normally arid parts of California.\u000a\u000aScientists say they expect stronger storms, in winter and summer, largely because of the physical principle that warmer air can hold more water vapor.\u000a\u000aTypically, a storm of the sort that inundated parts of Tennessee in May, dumping as much as 19 inches of rain over two days, draws moisture from an area much larger than the storm itself. With temperatures rising and more water vapor in the air, such storms can pull in more moisture and thus rain or snow more heavily than storms of old.\u000a\u000aIt will be a year or two before climate scientists publish definitive analyses of the Russian heat wave and the Pakistani floods, which might shed light on the role of climate change, if any. Some scientists suspect that they were caused or worsened by an unusual kink in the jet stream, the high-altitude flow of air that helps determine weather patterns, though that itself might be linked to climate change. Certain recent weather events were so extreme that a few scientists are shedding their traditional reluctance to ascribe specific disasters to global warming.\u000a\u000aAfter a heat wave in Europe in 2003 that killed an estimated 50,000 people, the worst such catastrophe for that region in the historical record, scientists published detailed analyses suggesting that it would not have been as severe in a climate uninfluenced by greenhouse gases.\u000a\u000aAnd Dr. Trenberth has published work suggesting that Hurricane Katrina dumped at least somewhat more rain on the Gulf Coast because the storm was intensified by global warming.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not the right question to ask if this storm or that storm is due to global warming, or is it natural variability,\u201d Dr. Trenberth said. \u201cNowadays, there\u2019s always an element of both.\u201d

V\u201cAs the need evolves, green jobs will become more specialised, which will then open up specialised training courses,\u201d says PepsiCo India executive director ( HR ) Pavan Bhatia. At present, institutions like Delhi University, Pune University, JNU, TERI in Delhi and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in Mumbai; School of Planning and Architecture, and several IITs, among others, run \u2018green\u2019 courses across levels like the Bachelors\u2019, Masters\u2019 MTech/ME, and even PhDs.\u000a\u000aCarbon finance courses are offered at IIMs Ahmedabad and Lucknow. Prodipto Ghosh, member of the Prime Minister\u2019s panel on climate change, believes a wide set of skills are required in the country, and companies are looking at fresh recruits with an understanding of the problems.\u000a\u000aPeople like Richa Gautam, 25, assistant manager in the sustainability cell at Mahindra and Mahindra, was pursuing her PhD in environment management from National Institute of Industrial Engineering, Mumbai, when she landed her job. \u201cOne needs to be passionate about the environment,\u201d she says, listing the qualifications. \u201cMy job involves visiting various plants and teaching workers about how sustainability helps create energy-efficient machinery and reduces carbon emissions.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor those looking for an alternative career, the green sector offers various opportunities. Working with an NGO, or a training programme on sustainability, can help one gain the necessary perspective. Then, organisations like ACC Cement, Ecosmart, SGS India, TCS, Reliance Energy and M&M offer internships and may even recruit the interns.\u000a\u000aSays SG Choudhary, chief sustainability and technology officer at Tata Chemicals: \u201cWe are planning to bring in environmental engineers and economists on board in the coming months, to help us cut down on environmental waste and chart out a course for the future.\u201d There is even demand for the more niche areas within the green sector, like carbon or energy management, and developing clean technology.\u000a\u000aGreen jobs are, unfortunately, still not viewed as lucrative. And that\u2019s mainly because of a lack of awareness, says Sonam Madav, who did a postgraduate programme in sustainability from the University of Leeds. While entry-level salaries are about Rs3.5 to Rs4.5 lakh per annum, packages in the mid-level can vary from Rs14-20 lakh and a senior professional could even command anything between Rs45 and 60 lakh, says Balaji of MaFoi.\u000a\u000aAs such specialised talent is still at a premium, compensation packages, are going up. Also, companies like Wipro setting aside a large part of their budget to go clean, helps. \u201cWe spend a major portion of our revenue on environment-related projects,\u201d says PS Narayan, general manager and head of CSR at Wipro. \u201cWith rising need, many more people will be required in the coming years.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s not just the professionals. Entrepreneurs like Nidhi Singh of Indigreen, which retails T-shirts and accessories made from organic material, says: \u201cOrganic farming is also a green job that many companies will soon take to. Such jobs not only profit corporates, but will also provide employment to large populations of rural folk too. That\u2019s why green jobs will always have the upper hand.\u201d

VIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chief Rajendra Pachauri\u2019s fate will be known Monday with the release of the findings of an investigation into charges that the panel grossly inflated the impact of global warming.\u000a\u000aUN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had in March asked Inter Academy Council (IAC), a body of top scientists and engineers from around the world, to investigate IPCC\u2019s blunders.\u000a\u000aThere is speculation that Pachauri might get away with just a rap on the knuckles for IPCC\u2019s assessments that the Himalayan glaciers will be gone by 2035, and the Amazonian forests were in danger too.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal quoted an unidentified member of the probe team to say the report will merely suggest that IPCC \u201cshould beef up its capacity to ferret out errors in its scientific assessments\u201d.\u000a\u000aIt will neither call for nor endorse the demand for Pachauri\u2019s dismissal, the journal reported.

VKOLKATA: The unplanned and unchecked real estate growth on EM Bypass and its adjoining areas, sans basic civic amenities , could spell disaster across the city, says a World Bank report submitted to the state government.It outlines how climate change and global warming are pushing these areas "to the brink of civic disaster".This first-of-its-kind study was conducted in some of the major cities in the country and identified Kolkata's environment as the most vulnerable and has a grim forecast for the Kolkata of 2050.The study warns that those who have either bought or plan to buy homes along EM Bypass and other areas of the eastern fringes, like Tiljala, Topsia, Tangra and Pagladanga (Wards 58, 59, 65, 66) could be the worst hit by environmental degradation because of rapid real estate growth sans a matching improvement in civic amenities.State chief environment officer Debal Roy said the World Bank study factored in Kolkata's social, economic and environmental circumstances. While identifying areas vulnerable to climate change, the team considered the state of a locality's drainage and sewerage systems and its hygiene standards. They were alarmed to find that ponds in eastern fringes are being filled up to make way for buildings that are being constructed in an unplanned manner in an area without a proper drainage system. Repeated waterlogging and accumulation of garbage is slowly degrading the environment.Based on the report, the environment department is framing a new state action plan on climate change, Roy said. The department has been working on these lines for some time and had come out with a report a few years ago on ways to improve conditions in areas like Tiljala and Topsia. It recently decided to make it mandatory for billboards to be solar-powered. Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said Kolkata Municipal Corporation would implement recommendations to improve the environment and include these measures in its own environment protection plan.The World Bank had earlier sanctioned Rs 347 crore for development of Bengal's coastal areas after the state submitted an integrated coastal zone management plan. The environment department is preparing poverty alleviation and skill development schemes for the coastal population. The government has taken an initiative on energy conservation, particularly for high-rise and multi-storied buildings in the hospitality sector.

VIn a bid to cut down carbon emissions, the aviation regulator has asked airlines to become fuel-efficient.\u000a\u000aThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) last week issued a circular directing domestic carriers to make in-house operational changes in order to discipline fuel usage.\u000a\u000aBy mid-October, all domestic carriers should submit reports of their fuel consumption patterns. Every quarter the regulator will review their performance.\u000a\u000aAir traffic contributes about 3 per cent of green house gas (GHG) emissions in the world. There is no researched data on what part Indian air traffic plays to that but projections show the country is amongst the few nascent markets to grow at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent in next five years.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are at a crucial stage. It is a good time to discipline out fuel usage,\u201d said a DGCA official requesting anonymity, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Using eco-friendly fuel is one of the most important changes suggested in the circular.\u000a\u000aAccording to the International Air Transport Association, the world\u2019s biggest airline lobby, expects its member to replace 10 per cent of aircraft jet fuel with alternative fuels by 2017.\u000a\u000aLast year four international member airlines had already experimented with biofuel mixes of jatropha, algae, or coconut oil, often blended with kerosene.\u000a\u000aIATA expects that the usage of such biofuels could potentially reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint by 80 per cent.\u000a\u000aCurrently, a single person\u2019s return journey from Mumbai to Delhi on an economic class ticket bears a carbon footprint of 246.12 kg.\u000a\u000aThe DGCA has suggested simple measures such as keeping the engine and airframe clean, using fuel-efficient airplanes such as the Airbus A 380 and cutting down flights on routes with low passenger loads.\u000a\u000aIt has already enforced rules that punish airlines for delays in order to eliminate fuel wastage because of circling above airports or waiting endlessly on tarmacs.\u000a\u000a\u201cAirlines until now used to solely blame air congestion for bad fuel efficiency. That excuse will not work anymore,\u201d said a senior official with the civil aviation ministry, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to the media.

VCHENNAI: In one frame, Indian farmers talk about their crops failing due to the lack of rain. In another, foreign tourists in Mamallapuram go into raptures about the magic of India that draws them to it again and again. Are the two related? In author and filmmaker Pamela Nowicka 's view, yes, as tourism is one of the major causes of climate change In Chennai to screen her half-hour documentary Climate Change? No Thanks!', Nowicka spoke about the effects on tourism on the environment. Her film uses examples of climate change in Tamil Nadu farmers in Vellore district who are facing drought to create awareness about wanton consumerism."Holidays are a luxury consumer item that produces enormous amounts of carbon emissions," says the UK-based Nowicka, who has been coming to south India for the last two decades. "Carbon emissions from flying causes a rise in temperature, which in turn leads to climate change and drought but people seldom make this connection."A long-haul fight emits approximately 1 tonne of climate change gases per person. "That's one tenth of the average carbon footprint of a person in the UK. Tourism is really about transportation, consumption tourists usually use more resources than the locals, changing the natural habitat, and denying local people access to areas such as beaches that are fenced off for tourists," she says.She says most people are in denial about the effects their travel has on the environment. "They say, The flight will go without me anyway. What can I do?' In the West, people view their holiday as an entitlement, unaware of the impact their consumption is having on others' lives. I wanted my film to show people how their excessive consumption is denying other people things as basic as water."Nowicka says the inspiration for the film came after she wrote a book in 2007, The No-Nonsense Guide to Tourism'. "Researching the book really opened my eyes to how tourism is a process. Governments think it is a way to generate foreign exchange. But the benefits only reach a few. The local population suffers the brunt of environmental damage and water shortage," says Nowicka who has been staying in Mamallapuram for the last two months.

Increasing ocean acidification could lead to a rapid decline of coral reefs and the marine ecosystem in the 21st century.\u000a\u000aUrgent action is necessary, the authors write. \u201cIt is clear from this analysis that higher ambitions for 2020 are necessary to keep the options for 2 C and 1.5 C open without relying on potentially infeasible reduction rates after 2020.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn addition, the absence of a mid-century emission goal \u2014 towards which Parties as a whole can work and which serve as a yardstick of whether interim reductions by 2020 and 2030 are on the right track \u2014 is a critical deficit in the Copenhagen Accord.\u201d \u2014 Our Bureau

VKOLKATA: Beginning later this month, the jatropha crop will be planted across 30,000 acres in the arid districts of Bankura, Birbhum, West Midnapore and Purulia over the next 15 years. Around 10 lakh saplings will be transplanted this year on 1,000 acres in Purulia, with the annual plantation target from next year pegged at 20 lakh saplings on 2,000 acres.The drive, undertaken jointly by state-promoted West Bengal Wasteland Development Corporation (WBWDC) and private firm Sun Plant Agro Ltd , is in sync with the Centre's Green India Mission to combat climate change by setting an ambitious target of afforestation and eco-restoration on 20 million hectares across India by 2020.Speaking to TOI, WBWDC managing director and additional principal chief conservator of forests Rakesh Sinha said jatropha would be grown between rows of fast-growing pulp species of trees planted on 3,000 acres in Purulia this year. "We have planted nearly 16 lakh trees already. Jatropha plantation will be done between these rows. This will not only enhance the economic output from the land that has been lying non-productive, but will also enhance the climate change mitigation efforts by promoting the use of bio-fuel," said Sinha.According to him, the jatropha plants will begin yielding 1,000 kg of seeds per acre from the third year, generating revenue of around `10,000. Of this, 30% each will go to land-owners and the forest department, while the remaining will go to Sun Agro. Planting began on Friday in the Hura, Puncha and Burrabazar areas of Purulia. The trees will be felled after they mature in 10 years and new ones will take their place. The proceeds will be split between the forest department and land-owners.The programme will also lead to the generation of carbon credits under the clean development mechanism (CDM) instituted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The credits will be divided equally between the forest department and Sun Agro."Apart from the larger objective of mitigating climate change, it will also lead to socio-economic benefits for the farmers who own non-productive land in the absence of agricultural inputs like irrigation," the officer pointed out.The total scope of plantation by WBWDC is on 50,000 acres, of which 80% land is located in the four drought-prone districts. While the corporation has begun plantation activity in Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum, it is yet to make any headway in West Midnapore due to the Maoist problem.

Another crucial issue heading into the next round of talks is the question of financial support and aid from developed countries for climate projects in developing countries.\u000a\u000aDemands from the West for Measurement, Reporting and Verification of emissions reduction projects in developing countries are another point of difference.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations in Tianjin would help narrow these differences and \u201cestablish the groundwork\u201d ahead of the November 29 Cancun conference, said Mr. Xie. A binding deal at the conference was unlikely, but China remained hopeful of reaching a deal in South Africa in 2011.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe already have a proposal on the table for long-term cooperative action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\u201d he said. \u201cAll countries will try to eliminate divergence as much as possible in Tianjin.\u201d\u000a\u000aChina, along with India, Brazil and South Africa, will play a key role in this week's talks in representing the interests of developing nations.

Between October 4 and 9, two working groups will meet to discuss two draft documents \u2014 a 70-page negotiating text for Cancun, as well as a draft proposal under the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000aIndia's Minister of Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh is scheduled to arrive here on October 10, and will meet with Mr. Xie and other Ministers after the negotiations conclude.\u000a\u000aThe negotiations in Tianjin mark the first instance of China hosting high-level climate negotiations \u2014 an indicator, according to some analysts, of the country's growing influence on the climate debate.\u000a\u000aChina has committed to reducing the carbon intensity of its emissions, or emissions per unit of GDP, by 40 per cent of 2005 levels by 2020.\u000a\u000aBut as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, developed nations say China should take on greater commitments.\u000a\u000aMr. Xie, however, said China had \u201calready paid a high price\u201d in taking on its current targets. \u201cAs a developing country, China faces more challenges than developed nations to control greenhouse gas emissions, since China has to boost economic growth, improve livelihoods and protect the environment at the same time,\u201d he said.

An eminent panel of jury members will listen to the testimonies and announce their verdict.\u000a\u000aThe public hearing will be organized by a Jaipur based NGO, Centre for Community Economic Development Consultant Society (CECOEDECON) at their academic campus at Swaraj in Sitapura from 10 am to 4 pm. on Ocober 5, 2010.\u000a\u000aAlka Awasthi, co-director of said during the public hearing, various government departments, research institutions and other agencies to mainstream aspects into their work plans would be sensitized. About 150 representatives across the state will participate. She pointed out that Rajasthan has witnessed impacts in the form of highly variable rainfall playing havoc with agricultural cycles, in turn leading to food insecurity and loss of livelihoods in rural Rajasthan.\u000a\u000aAchieving the Millennium Development Goals of reducing hunger, poverty, infant mortality rate, etc is going to be even more difficult in the face of climate change. She said that studies conducted in Rajasthan have already indicated the warming of weather, prolonging of the summer season, and unpredictable and highly variable rainfall.\u000a\u000aThis hearing will be aimed at sensitizing state level actors-research organisations, agencies working on livelihoods, media etc to focus their programme on addressing climate change. The sufferers of climate change will themselves - in front of eminent panel of judges, scientists, bureaucrats and social scientists - present the selected testimonies in this hearing.The verdict will be shared with the State Government officials, so that concerns of the farmer community can be mainstreamed in their agenda for climate change.

VPUNE: The demand of waste pickers from across the world for recognition of their efforts in providing "a solution to climate change problem " has a Pune voice too.Baidabai Gaikwad, who collects waste in Fursungi area, attended the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) held in Tianjin, China, recently."We told them how our recycling work is nature friendly and why all governments should take steps to increase recycling instead of burning the waste," said Gaikwad."Generation of a corpus fund is necessary for dealing with the health issues of waste pickers. Such an effort will help implement pension and other welfare programmes. Besides, we can increase recycling work and produce bio gas from the organic waste with the help of this money," said Gaikwad recalling her speech at the UN convention."The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN will be helpful for us in this fund raising," she said, adding, "right now the CDM finances private companies that burn waste. This burning leads to pollution. Instead, this waste could be recycled and composted. We will be able to do that and make our contribution to the fight against climate change."Gaikwad also put up the demand for an identity cards for waste pickers. "I-cards will help us carry out our work more safely," she added.A city-based NGO Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (KKPKP), was associated with the arrangements of the tour. The organisation too has vouched for a CDM for waste pickers.According to Nalini Shekar of KKPKP, recycling reduces emissions from deforestation, mining, manufacturing, transport and disposal. "The waste pickers' work has not got enough attention on the international platform. This picture should change. These people have made a lot of contribution in solid waste management," she said.

VWith climate change taking its toll on Earth,rock avalanches and landslides have become more common in high mountain ranges over the last decade.\u000a\u000aThe collapses are caused by melting glaciers and permafrost,which remove the glue that binds steep mountain slopes together.\u000a\u000aHowever,the worse part may be to come. Thinning glaciers on volcanoes could destabilize vast chunks of their summit cones,triggering mega-landslides capable of flattening cities such as Seattle and devastating local infrastructure.\u000a\u000aTo assess the risk,Daniel Tormey of ENTRIX,an environmental consultancy based in Los Angeles,studied a huge landslide that occurred 11,000 years ago on Planchn-Peteroa.\u000a\u000aHe focused on this glaciated volcano in Chile because its altitude and latitude make it likely to feel the effects of climate change before others.\u000a\u000a\u201cAround one-third of the volcanic cone collapsed,\u201d Tormey says. Ten billion cubic metres of rock crashed down the mountain and smothered 370 square kilometres of land,travelling 95 kilometres in total.\u000a\u000aStudies have suggested that intense rain cannot provide the lubrication needed for this to happen,so Tormey concludes that glacier melt must have been to blame.\u000a\u000aWith global temperatures on a steady rise,Tormey is concerned that history will repeat itself on volcanoes all over the world. He thinks that many volcanoes in temperate zones could be at risk.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are far more human settlements and activities near the slopes of glaciated active volcanoes today than there were 10,000 years ago,so the effects could be catastrophic,\u201d New Scientist quoted him as saying.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest News Archive News, download Indian Express App

VTill a few years ago, climate change was the elephant in the room at global development forums. Leaders were aware of it but either chose not to see it or denied it had consequences that could be even remotely catastrophic. Things have changed since, quite dramatically. Today, climate change is viewed as a problem of elephantine proportions.Things have moved up a notch from last year, which ended with the much publicized no-show at the Copenhagen summit . Not only has a global consensus emerged that climate change is for real, but there\u2019s increasing discussion about the tricky question of action required to contain it.While much scientific literature, as well as striking images, is available on the devastation that greenhouse gases have been wreaking on the globe \u2013 glacial and polar ice melts, rising global mean temperatures and sea levels \u2013 what is now needed is more country-specific research and discussion on the hazards ahead and ways to mitigate them."Climate Change, Society & Sustainable Development: Agenda for Action", makes a good beginning in this direction, for India. It\u2019s a collection of papers by experts \u2013 scientific researchers, agriculture agriculture and energy specialists, policy-planners, non-governmental voices and advocacy groups. It presents both the wide arc of the problem as well as a deeper look into the sectoral issues involved.The book aims to, according to the foreword by M S Swaminathan , father of the Green Revolution , provide information that would help "develop a strategy for sustainable human security in our country". That may sound ambitious but the book\u2019s multi-disciplinary approach is the right way to go about understanding these issues in India.However, it has some limitations. These are imposed by our current level of knowledge. For instance, veteran glaciologist Syed Iqbal Hasnain in his paper on the Hindu Kush and Himalayan glaciers points to the need for more on-site research to better understand the dynamics of melting and downwasting of glaciers. Climate scientist S K Dash, while touching on differential temperature increases in regions, prolonged fog in cities and changes in rainfall patterns, also calls for more data. That said, the book will serve both the serious reader who wants to look at the intertwined shoots and branches of the climate problem, and the policy planner for whom it would be a ready reckoner of sorts.

VIndia Inc more open about carbon footprint......Snehal Rebello Some of the top firms in India have become more forthcoming about sharing data on their carbon emissions and proactive about mitigating them. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2010 for India, released on Thursday, had sent questionaires to 200 companies in India. Of the 51 that responded, 85% shared their emission levels as against 62% last year and 33% in 2008. In the last three years, emission levels have increased almost four-fold to 114 million tonnes, compared to 68.9 million tonnes in 2009 and 36.3 million tonnes in 2008. Mahindra and Mahindra, Wipro, Larsen & Turbo, Ambuja Cement Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services, HSBC and Yes Bank were among the respondents. There has also been a rise \u2014 from 26% in 2008 to 46% in 2010 \u2014 in companies reporting tertiary activities such as business travel, waste generation and disposal, courier and logistics. \u201cGreen house emissions must be measured to be managed,\u201d said Paul Simpson, chief executive officer, CDP, London. Ten firms said they saved Rs 3,933 million along with emission reduction of 6.2 million metric tonnes of carbon equivalent. URL: http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-Inc-more-open-about-carbon-footprint/Article1-619216.aspx Companies get proactive about reducing emissions....Snehal Rebello More and moreIndian companies areactively engaged in dealing with climate change and are formulating policies to reduce their carbon footprint. According to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2010 for India, companies with a committee or an executive body to look after climate change has grown to 84 per cent this year as compared to 39 per cent in 2007.The four-year-old initiative released its report on Thursday. The report was released by the Confederation Of Indian Industries, British Council and World Wildlife Fund. Of the 200 companies that were sent requests to participate, 51 companies volunteered information. While 33 per cent of participating companies have set targets to improve energy efficiency and emissions reduction target, 24 per cent are in the process of developing targets. Industry leaders seem to be very active in influencing the government on climate change policies with 68 per cent companies engaging with policy makers and regulators to contribute to the response to climate change. While 97per cent looked at opportunities arising from addressing climate change, 80 per cent saw risks involved in terms of regulatory, physical or commercial aspects. \u201cClimate change is not just about threats but also opportunities,\u201dsaid Arunavo Mukerjee, vice president, Tata Quality Management Services. \u201cAnd good environmental practices are good business practices.They go together and not at opposite ends.\u201dApart from the highly intensive material sector that was in forefront in terms of the quality of emission levels disclosure, non-intensive sectors such as finances andI Thave also started reporting on emissions.The report revealed that 68 per cent companies had adopted energy savings mechanisms such as robust planning, green buildings and energy audit to reducee mission levels. Seventy four percent did it via emissions reductions through adoption of clean fuel, technological innovations or improvements and exploring renewable energy. \u201cThe interest in carbon disclosure today is higher than before. And there is an increased level of understanding to make it accurate because only then will it useful for the industry,\u201d said Jamshyd Godrej, chairman, National Council on Climate Change, CII. \u201cGovernments all over the world will soon make the disclosure mandatory.\u201dCompanies have also become transparent with disclosing information to employees and investors with 67 per cent publishing information about their responses to climate change and green house gase missions. Apart from companies being open to information,employees are also being sensitised. So 42 per cent companies have incentive schemes for employees who adopt best practices such as switching of the computer monitor each time they leave their desk as well as for achieving emission targets.

VBEIJING: China\u2019s leaders are promising to narrow its huge trade surplus and curb surging emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases in an ambitious 5-year plan to make its economy cleaner and more high-tech.\u000a\u000aThe Communist Party plan also promises to encourage consumer spending to reduce reliance on exports to power growth. The plan was approved last week by party leaders and reported on Thursday by the state media. Such 5-year plans are a holdover from China\u2019s era of central planning, but the ruling party still uses them to craft long-term goals for this fast-changing society.\u000a\u000aThe latest plan reflects ambitions to transform China from a low-wage nation of factory workers and farmers into a consumer society and creator of technology. It says Beijing will expand domestic demand while also improving the competitiveness of China\u2019s export industries, according to the party newspaper People\u2019s Daily and other media. \u201cImports should also be promoted, so as to pursue a trade balance,\u201d the newspaper said.\u000a\u000aAction to narrow China\u2019s swollen trade surplus, which hit $16.9 billion in September, might help ease tensions with Washington and demands by some American lawmakers to sanction Beijing. Reacting to complaints Beijing\u2019s currency controls are adding to its trade surplus, the US House of Representatives passed legislation last month to allow Washington to penalise governments that manipulate their currency for trade advantage. The Senate is due to take up the measure later.\u000a\u000aThe plan also reflects the intention of Chinese leaders to steer rapid economic growth to a more sustainable level and focus on making the energy- and resource-hungry economy more efficient and spread prosperity to the rural and urban poor. Narrowing the yawning, politically volatile wealth gap between an elite who have benefited most from three decades of economic reform and the country\u2019s poor majority is a key issue for the ruling party.\u000a\u000aThe plan gave no detailed targets for economic growth that moderated to 9.6% in the latest quarter and is expected to slow in coming years. It also promises to curb greenhouse gas emissions, though the reports on Thursday gave no indication of movement on demands by Washington and other governments for China, the world\u2019s biggest source of such gases, to accept binding limits.\u000a\u000aAs a developing country, China is not bound by international emissions limits but has promised to rein in its output. A key sticking point in the latest global climate talks is whether Beijing will accept binding limits, which it has so far rejected.\u000a\u000aThe plan also calls for technology development to reduce reliance on foreign know-how \u2014 a key goal of the communist leadership over the past decade. \u201cChina should upgrade its capabilities in indigenous research and innovation,\u2019\u2019 the plan says, according to the People\u2019s Daily. It gave no details but state media have said Beijing might spend up to 4 trillion yuan ($600 billion) to develop new and emerging industries over the next five years.

VThe Norwegian government has offered Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) a stake in a $1-billion carbon capture storage project at Statoil\u2019s Mongstad oil refinery in Norway.\u000a\u000aThe offer was made at a meeting between a Norwegian delegation, headed by state secretary, petroleum and energy, Per Rune Henriksen, and Chairman and Managing Director and Director (offshore) Sudhir Vasudeva earlier this week.\u000a\u000aNorway is also offering India technology for deepwater and subsea exploration.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Business Standard, Henriksen said, \u201cWe are looking for partnership with Indian in Technology Centre, Mongstad, and have invited the chairman to visit the facility.\u201d On the equity being offered to ONGC, he said it was \u201ca matter of discussion\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe Norwegian government holds 75.12 per cent in the project, while state-owned Statoil owns 20 per cent. Shell and South African state-owned company Sasol own 2.44 per cent each.\u000a\u000aLocated at the Statoil Mongstad oil refinery, northwest of Bergen, the CO2 Technology Centre would have access to flue gas from the gas-fired combined heat and power plant and the refinery catalytic cracker. CO2 stands for carbon dioxide.\u000a\u000aAfter the development of a viable technology, the process could be commercially used in countries like India and China, which have a growing demand for carbon-emitting energy. The partners have already invested about $450 million in the project. Carbon capture and storage technology involves capturing CO2 emissions from industrial sources and transporting them by pipeline to sites, where they are injected into deep rock formations for permanent storage. The centre will test two types of capture technology on flue gas, both from the Mongstad refinery cracker and a gas-fired combined heat power plant on the site. While the gas-based power plant yields CO2 contents of about 3.5 per cent, the refinery cracker gives 13 per cent of flue gas, equivalent to a coal-based power plant.\u000a\u000aDesigned to capture about 100,000 tonnes CO2 annually, the project was earlier expected to be completed in 2011, but funding issues have delayed its full commissioning to 2012. In May 2010, Sasol joined the project. \u201cThe partnerships are important for us since we want to get the point of views of other into the project,\u201d said Henriksen.

VThey've previously tackled alien invasions, gang violence in New York and how to raise a happy family, but this week computer games wrestle with an even more pressing issue: climate change.\u000a\u000aArriving on PCs on Tuesday and Macs shortly after, the British-made Fate of the World puts players at the helm of a future World Trade Organisation-style environmental body with a task of saving the world by cutting carbon emissions or damning it by letting soaring temperatures wreak havoc through floods, droughts and fires.\u000a\u000aThe strategy game is already being hailed by gaming experts as a potential breakthrough for such social change titles, and welcomed by climate campaigners as a way of reaching new audiences.\u000a\u000aWhile traditional mainstream games have focused on action, sports and increasingly casual genres, Fate of the World features data from real-world climate models, anecdotes from the polar explorer Pen Hadow and input from a team of scientists and economists in the US and UK. It has been developed by Oxford-based games designers Red Redemption, whose previous browser-based climate game for the BBC has been played more than a million times since it was launched in 2006.\u000a\u000aGobion Rowlands, chairman at Red Redemption and a board member of social gaming organisation Games for Change, said the game was inspired by his desire to make the subject more accessible and a drunken boast to Dr Myles Allen, head of climate dynamics at Oxford University and a contributor to the last report by the UN's climate science panel.\u000a\u000a"My wife was working on Allen's Climateprediction.net project [a project to use the power of home PCs to process climate model data], when he took me out for dinner. We got quite drunk, and I bragged that we could make a computer game about anything. He challenged us to make one about climate change."\u000a\u000aAllen has provided the prediction models used in the game. "For far too long, climate policy has been developed by unelected technocrats in smoke-free conference centres or through talkshow soundbites," said Allen. "What I like about this game is that it allows people to experience, in an idealised world, of course, the kinds of decisions we are likely to confront, and makes it clear there are no easy answers: should we start mining methane clathrates [gas trapped in arctic ice], for example?"\u000a\u000aTom Chatfield, gaming expert and the author of Fun Inc: Why Games Are the 21st Century's Most Serious Business, said: "This could be the beginning of a flowering of issue-led gaming. But it will be judged on whether it's a good game, not on whether it's worthy or not."\u000a\u000aHe said that, although some mainstream titles \u2013 such as the Civilization franchise, which has sold more than 6m copies \u2013 had touched on issues of sustainability and pollution before, most games with an overt social message often had a lower budget and gave a less polished experience. "It will be interesting to see if this game can resolve that tension \u2013 I can't list many games that are both campaigning and staggeringly good."\u000a\u000aBut, he added, issue-driven titles on everything from health to human rights, such as the browser-based Darfur is Dying, \u2013 a game based on life as a refugee in Sudan played by more than 800,000 people were improving in quality and popularity. Just over half of all gamers play games in which they think about moral and ethical issues, according to a 2008 study by the Pew Research Centre of 1,102 12- to 17-year-olds.\u000a\u000aBoth Rowlands and Chatfield agree that games as a medium are uniquely placed to tackle the complexity of climate change. "Two of the problems with environmental issues are time and geography \u2013 getting people to care about people on the other side of the planet and problems far in the future," said Chatfield. "But if people can feel and see the evolution of variables in a system \u2013 such as a changing climate \u2013 it can be a better way of learning than reading lots of scientific prose."\u000a\u000a"Games handle complexity well," said Rowlands. "Partly because you learn by doing, but also because of the length of interaction \u2013 you could be playing for up to 50 hours, during which you learn a huge amount about how a game works. In an age when we're accused of dumbing down, computer games can reverse that trend and help us to smarten up."\u000a\u000aGreen campaigners have welcomed gaming joining other cultural efforts \u2013 from Ian McEwan's recent novel Solar to the BBC's drama Burn Up featuring Neve Campbell \u2013 to take on the subject.

VLONDON: Business leaders of hundreds of companies from around the world, including India, have released a renewed demand for "an ambitious, robust and equitable global deal on climate change".They say companies companies are already investing in a low-carbon future and governments must respond to this by both redoubling efforts to secure an international framework but also by pursuing an ambitious "parallel mitigation strategy".The statement - known as The Cancun Communique - is an initiative of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, which is a cross-sectoral group of major international companies working with the University of Cambridge to call for more ambitious action to tackle climate change, a university release said.The Communique was presented by corporate leaders from the group to European Commissioner for Climate Action , Connie Hedegaard, and the Ambassador of Mexico to the EU, H E Sandra Fuentes-Berain in Brussels yesterday.They were joined by Ambassadors and Government Representatives from the European Parliament, Australia, Canada, Japan, India, South Africa, Turkey, UK, and US.Commissioner Hedegaard said: "Major investments are needed to develop a low-carbon economy and for Europe to continue to lead in this field.This will require a continued involvement of the private sector, along with ambitious and proactive interventions by governments".This is part of a series of events to present the Communiqu to decision makers around the world and invite further support from the business community.The Cancun Communiqu is the successor to previous communiqus such as the Bali, Poznan, and Copenhagen Communiqus.The Cancun Communiqu has already secured the support of more than 250 companies based in over 36 countries, and is expected to gather much more support before UN negotiators meet in Cancun, on 29 November.Communiqu signatories include some of the world's largest companies and best known brands in the energy, professional services, transport, technology, manufacturing, telecommunications and banking sectors from countries including the EU, Mexico, US, Japan, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, China and South Africa.

VINCHEON (SOUTH KOREA): India's efforts on disaster risk reduction came in for praise by the United Nations at the recently concluded 4th Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction ( DRR ) hosted by South Korea's National Emergency Management Agency here.Margareta Wahistrom, special representative of the UN secretary-general on DRR, said India did a commendable job in the post-tsunami rehabilitation work and has since taken a number of steps towards reduction of disaster risk. She, however, called for the government to incorporate DRR in its national policy to cope with climate change.The four-day ministerial conference called for governments to earmark at least 10% of all rescue and rehabilitation funds towards disaster risk reduction. It also adopted a five-year regional roadmap on DRR and climate change adaptation, which includes capacity building activities, enhanced information sharing and solutions to manage climate risks using various technologies.India has been effectively using technology such as SMS, radio, television, watch towers and loudspeakers in disaster risk zones to communicate to its population on eviction in time of danger. It is in the process of activating a regional warning centre on gathering seismological and tidal data to send out alerts to coastal regions. Currently, the warning centre on seismological data is in Japan and Hawaii which have been sending alerts to national agencies in Indian Ocean countries.Highlighting the importance for countries like India to invest in disaster risk, the UN official said since half of the world GDP falls in the disaster risk zone, countries which have not invested in DRR are more likely to fail in achieving their full economic potential.A new joint report from the World Bank and the United Nations, released last week, said annual global losses from natural disasters could triple to $185 billion by the end of this century, even without calculating the impact of climate change.Climate change could then add $28 to $68 billion more in damages each year from tropical cyclones alone, the report said. The report also said that the number of people exposed to storms and earthquakes in large cities could double to 1.5 billion by 2050.The 250-page report, `Natural Hazards, Unnatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention' was targeted at the world's finance ministers and stressed on prevention as that alone pays to mitigate the economic impact.It went on to suggest removing rent controls, something India can take notice of as the report pointed out that by doing so, it would bring in incentives for landlords to maintain buildings and thus result in less number of mishaps and deaths. This is important, in view of how a poorly constructed building in Delhi collapsed resulting in 67 deaths.

VAs the curtain rises in Cancn,Mexico,on the next round of international talks on climate change,expectations are low that the delegates will agree on a new treaty to reduce emissions. They were unable to do so last year in Copenhagen,and since then the negotiating positions of the biggest countries have grown even further apart.\u000a\u000aYet it is still possible to make significant progress. To give these talks their best chance,the delegates in Cancn should move beyond their focus on long-term efforts to stop warming and take a few immediate,practical actions that could have a tangible effect.\u000a\u000aThe opportunity to make progress arises from the fact that global warming is caused by two separate types of pollution. One is the long-term buildup of carbon dioxide,which can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. Diplomacy has understandably focused on this problem because,without deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions,there can be no permanent solution to warming.\u000a\u000aThe carbon dioxide problem is hard to fix,however,because it comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels,so essential to modern life and commerce. It will take decades and trillions of dollars to convert all the worlds fossil-fuel-based energy systems to cleaner systems like nuclear,solar and wind power. In the meantime,a fast-action plan is needed.\u000a\u000aBut carbon dioxide is not the only kind of pollution that contributes to global warming. Other potent warming agents include three short-lived gases  methane,some hydrofluorocarbons and lower atmospheric ozone- and dark soot particles. The warming effect of these pollutants,which stay in the atmosphere for several days to about a decade,is already about 80 per cent of the amount that carbon dioxide causes. The world could easily reduce these pollutants; the technology and regulatory systems needed to do so are already in place.Big cuts are also possible in hydrofluorocarbons,or HFCs,many of which are used as refrigerants in air-conditioners and other cooling systems.\u000a\u000aFrom a political point of view,the most appealing greenhouse emissions to reduce are ozone and soot,because they contribute so much to local air pollution. After all,people everywhere care about the quality of the air they breathe,even if most of them are not yet very worried about global warming. A desire to clean up the air is a rare point of commonality between developing and industrialised nations.\u000a\u000aPollution restrictions that reduce ozone levels,especially in the rapidly growing polluted cities of Asia,could both clear the air and slow warming. Soot likewise offers an opportunity to marry local interests with the global good. New air pollution regulations could help reduce soot. In China and India,a programme to improve power generation,filter soot from diesel engines,reduce emissions from brick-making kilns and provide more efficient cookstoves could cut the levels of soot in those regions by about two-thirds  and benefit countries downwind as well.\u000a\u000aReducing soot and the other short-lived pollutants would not stop global warming,but it would buy time,perhaps a few decades,for the world to put in place more costly efforts to regulate carbon dioxide. And it would help the major economies demonstrate credibility on climate change,which has been in short supply in the diplomatic talks so far.\u000a\u000aThe impasse that was evident in Copenhagen last year arises in part from the inability of China,India,Europe and the United States to show that they are adopting practical measures to slow climate change. Agreeing on a shared strategy to curtail short-lived pollutants would be a good way for all of them to start. For too long,overly ambitious global climate talks have focused on the aspects of global warming that are hardest to solve. A few more modest steps,with quick and measurable effects,are a better way to proceed.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aThis beach resort, swarming with tourists and sports utility vehicles and having opulent hotels and evident unsustainability, may not be the ideal place for a climate change conference but the real issues of climate change are too critical not to be debated anywhere.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Climate Change Conference that gets under way here on Monday may not result in much in terms of emission reduction agreements. The main focus could be on forestry issues and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) plus where significant progress could be made.\u000a\u000aThe response to the conference is lukewarm but no less than 15,000 delegates are expected to attend the deliberations. REDD plus aims to reward the developing nations for protecting, restoring and sustainably managing forests and it offers one of the cheapest options for cutting global greenhouse gases, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).\u000a\u000aPrincipal climate change scientist at the CIFOR Louis Verchot said that among the key issues likely to be addressed was whether to include REDD plus as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC).\u000a\u000aIn India, the mechanism of REDD has not been implemented and there are several issues related to ownership of forests, forest rights and protection. The CIFOR said $ 4.5 billion was promised so far, much of it from Norway in bilateral agreements but money was not the sole consideration. A major breakthrough would be needed in the UNFCC negotiations.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Mexican government is committed to ensuring that participants' mobilisation and energy consumption during the conference results in the smallest environmental impact, in compliance with its obligations as host of the Sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16) and the Sixth Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP6).\u000a\u000aA statement says one of the main goals of the Mexican authorities is to ensure that a large amount of the energy used during the conference comes from renewable sources, hence, minimising as much as possible the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aIn the framework of the Mexican-Italian environmental cooperation programme, the Mexican government is engaged in supplying energy through a system of photovoltaic cells with an estimated output of 130kW. The installation of a wind power generator with a 1.5-MW capacity will contribute to Cancun's electric output through an additional renewable source.\u000a\u000aRegarding transportation, delegations of participating countries will be provided with hybrid vehicles for their transfers during the conference.\u000a\u000aThe Mexican government has implemented a special hotel assessment programme here, aimed at enhancing sustainable operation. Through the programme, Environmental Leadership for Competitiveness, implemented by SEMARNAT, hotels will set eco-efficiency projects to reduce the use of raw materials, energy and water during the conference. It is expected to avoid the consumption of approximately 2,00,000 m{+3} of water and the release of 4,000 tonnes of CO{+2} into the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aMeasuring emissions\u000a\u000aParticipants attending COP16/CMP6 will be able to access online and through the booths located at the conference venue a carbon footprint calculator to measure emissions associated to their air and ground transportation, lodging and meals. This calculation will allow the users to mitigate their respective emissions by opting for one of the projects listed in the voluntary Mexican market or those associated to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).\u000a\u000aIndigenous communities' projects in the Mixe and Chinanteca regions of the Sierra Madre in Oaxaca, through the voluntary forest Mexican market are an example of the options available for carrying out this exercise.\u000a\u000aAround 10,000 trees and bushes will be planted in Cancun. This will contribute both to carbon capture and sequestration, to further beautify the Luis Donaldo Colosio Boulevard, which is the city's main artery.\u000a\u000aA residual waste management programme will operate during the conference. It is aimed at enhancing the processing of different waste materials and their incorporation to productive cycles avoiding their final disposal. The programme includes the placing of recycle bins in the official meeting areas of COP16/CMP6 events, other locations within Cancun.

VIndia aims at bringing United States back on board at Cancun climate talks but has termed its offer on climate mitigation as \u201chomeopathetic\u201d.\u000a\u000aTo clinch US, India has two proposals. First, which appeals to the United States, is on measurement review and verification (MRV) regime. India has proposed that nations, whose emissions are one% or more of the global average, should allow verification of their domestic mitigation commitments through a United Nations process.\u000a\u000aUS has been seeking verification of climate commitments of major emitters like China to agree to any climate treaty and India\u2019s proposal ensures that. Brazil, India\u2019s partner in global talks, has opposed the move.\u000a\u000aThe second plan is setting up a global network of climate innovations centres on pattern of Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil US agrees there is no use of climate talks,\u201d environment minister Jairam Ramesh said, at a Center for Science and Environment function.\u000a\u000aRamesh believes the US offer of reducing emissions by 14% by 2020 to its 2005 level, which is zero as compared to 1990 level, was \u201cpathetic\u201d.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is like a homeopathic treatment and is homeopathetic,\u201d he said, while expecting that Cancun will help in building foundation for climate talks.\u000a\u000aThe biggest bottleneck for Cancun is failure of the rich nations to deliver $30 billion as committed in Copenhagen a year ago. There is clarity only on $seven billion, of which $four billion is being provided for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.\u000a\u000aThe US, which announced $100 billion, has provided only $1.8 billion, of which $400 million is as export credit. \u201cThe fast track finance being provided is bizarre,\u201d Ramesh said.\u000a\u000aFor Cancun, it would mean further dent in the \u201ctrust deficit\u201d with the developing world losing faith on the developed nations for its failure to meet its finance commitment.\u000a\u000aAround 70% of 193 nations need money to adapt for climate change implications. In all this, Mexico is floating an idea of Cancun mandate, aimed at legitimising the Copenhagen accord, initially between US and few rich countries.

Asrar.\u000a\u000aPresenting a snapshot of some extreme events over the past decade here on Tuesday, Dr. Asrar said a research of such events in the last 10 years looked at the connection between climate change and the frequency, magnitude and the extent of extreme events based on case studies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe findings are consistent with the first report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990, which said that episodes of high temperature would most likely become more frequent in the future and cold episodes less frequent. However, there is a limit to the predictions and correlations that can be made and to say if all these events are due to climate change. For example, there is scientific evidence that supports the link between climate change and the frequency of heat waves,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998.\u000a\u000aThe 2000s were warmer than the 1990s and the Nineties were warmer than the Eighties and earlier decades.\u000a\u000aOn September 19, 2010, at the end of the melt season, the sea ice extent was the third smallest on satellite record after 2007 and 2009. \u201cGlobal mean sea level is higher now and is rising more rapidly than at any other time in the past 3000 years at the pace of around 3.4 millimetres a year.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the absence of a standard definition of an extreme event, the research looked at a single or a succession of weather phenomena leading to abnormal meteorological and/ or climate conditions with high impacts such as heat waves, severe storms, flooding and drought.\u000a\u000aThe snapshot looks at 34 major events from the extreme cold winter in Siberia in 2001 where temperatures dropped to minus 60, hurricane Catarina in 2004 that developed in the South Atlantic Ocean for the first time, the worst drought in Brazil, the deadliest hurricane since 1928 \u2014 Katrina, the tropical cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar, floods in Pakistan and exceptional rainfall in many parts of the world.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is one striking feature that has been observed and that is that most of the extreme events like hurricanes, tropical storms, heat waves, rainfall are regional in nature and it would be difficult to generalise or make projections on a global scale,\u201d Dr. Asrar said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the magnitude and frequency were showing an upward trend.\u000a\u000aThe episodes of high temperatures were likely to be more frequent than cold. The heat wave in July in Russia was worse than the heat wave of Europe in 2003, which was in a class of its own.\u000a\u000aThe heat wave in Russia was unprecedented since the 1500s.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese events, which are large in magnitude and different from past events, support the IPCC findings that the frequency, magnitude and extent of events are going to be different from the past,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aEven the IPCC's fourth assessment report warned that the number of heat waves was going to increase and warm nights are on the rise. Dr. Asrar said the heat was drying the soil and causing droughts in some parts.\u000a\u000aUsing the case studies of extreme events in the last decade, it was possible to project that extreme events would be greater in the future, he said.\u000a\u000aThe frequency of tropical storms, hurricanes, cyclones would be higher in magnitude as the IPCC had said.\u000a\u000aMore intense storms\u000a\u000aThe latest projections bear out the same thing and point to more severe events.\u000a\u000aThe projections also indicated a warmer climate and more intense storms and hurricanes. \u201cWhat we know of extreme events is that they are significantly different in the last decade from historical records. We can't quantify or attribute with great certainty the influence of warming on extreme events but these things are possible in a warmer climate,\u201d he said.

VThe has again dived, on prospects of supply increasing. Prices have fallen by more than 20 per cent in six weeks and are at a four-month low.\u000a\u000aThere are two sets of reasons. Credits from HFC-23 (fluoroform, a potent greenhouse gas) projects will go up, as the suspension on such projects has been lifted. Also, many power plants have been shifting from coal to much cheaper gas, which is passing through a glut, leading to lower demand for purchasing such credits.\u000a\u000a(CER, also called carbon credits) prices are trading only a little above the current financial year\u2019s low, seen in July. They\u2019re down nearly 20 per cent from the recent high of 14.07 in October.\u000a\u000aSome months earlier, the United Nations\u2019 Forum for Climate Change\u2019s (UNFCC\u2019s) Clean Development Mechanism had suspended carbon credits generated by HFC-23 projects, which had led to a rise in prices. However, many companies in and had sold such credits at 9-10 each.\u000a\u000aLobbying by these buyers met with success and CDM approved the credits generated by such projects. The decision came last weekend and CER prices on the European climate exchange fell further in the beginning of the week, reaching a level which is the lowest in the past four months.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe CDM executive board\u2019s decision to lift the suspension on the issuance of carbon credits to HFC-23 projects might have come as good news for the project developers, but it will have its repercussion on the pricing economics of carbon credits. The move is likely to press down the prices of the credits due to the enhanced supply,\u201d said Anmol Singh Jaggi, Director, Gensol Consultants.\u000a\u000aJaggi says the has turned bearish. He says, \u201cThe move was largely unexpected, owing to which the prices of the credits had shot up in the recent past. Now that these credits will be added to the market\u2019s breadth, one can safely expect carbon prices to tumble further, a fact that is likely to hurt investors\u2019 confidence. All hopes now hinge on the outcome of the Cancun climate talks. Only a positive result can lift up the battered sentiment in the carbon market.\u201d\u000a\u000aPrices were falling in recent weeks also because there was lower demand for such credits from power plants.\u000a\u000aAccording to Platts, the leading information provider on energy, \u201cCoal prices have been rising and gas prices remained subdued for long. This was also bearish for carbon prices, since higher coal values incentivise power generators with the ability to change fuels to switch to burning gas, which is less carbon-intensive, reducing their carbon-purchasing needs.\u201d

VUpdated: Thu, Dec 02 2010. 02 44 PM IST\u000a\u000aNew Delhi: An Indian proposal on how rich and poor nations report their actions to fight global warming could help get the United States on board for a broad agreement on climate change, India\u2019s environment minister said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aNegotiators at 29 Nov. to 10 Dec. UN climate talks in Mexico are trying to define the climate actions required of developed and emerging economies, to overcome a major area of dispute in sharing the burden of carbon emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aStalling progress is the question how rich and poor countries report their cuts and actions, and whether this controversial issue also called measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) should be subject to international review.\u000a\u000aIn Mexico, India is proposing all countries, rich and poor, that contribute more than 1% of global greenhouse gases should report their steps to the United Nations every three years. Others can report their actions every six years.\u000a\u000aActions of developing countries will be voluntary and failure to meet any domestic target non punitive, the proposal says.\u000a\u000aUnder the United Nations\u2019 existing Kyoto Protocol, only rich countries have to meet binding emissions targets and report actions regularly. But developed nations led by the United States, which never ratified Kyoto, want emerging economies such as China and India to take on a greater share of climate actions.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s because developing nations now emit more than half of mankind\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and that portion is growing quickly. China has already passed the United States as the world\u2019s top carbon polluter.\u000a\u000aEmerging nations say they will accept international consultation and analysis (ICA) of their emissions actions, but not anything equal to the standards expected of rich economies. They blame the rich for much of the greenhouse pollution pumped into the atmosphere over the past two centuries.\u000a\u000aBreaking the Logjam\u000a\u000aRamesh told Reuters that the Indian MRV/ICA proposal should help get the United States, a potential provider of global green technology, onboard for any meaningful progress in the Mexico talks.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout the ICA, the United States is not going to come on board and we have to bring the US on board,\u201d he said in an interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a political proposal not a negotiating proposal. It is basically meant to break the logjam and it is basically meant to bring the US in because without some progress in MRV/ICA the US is not going to come on board.\u201d\u000a\u000aRamesh said progress on reporting climate actions by all nations also depended on \u201csome quid pro quo\u201d from the United States particularly on sharing green technology and the Europeans on the second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a 10-point proposal for MRV/ICA and a 10-point proposal for technology cooperation. Initial reaction seems to be positive, but obviously it will require more consultations.\u201d\u000a\u000aFraught climate negotiations last year failed to agree on a binding treaty and climaxed in a bitter meeting in Copenhagen, which produced a vague and non-binding accord that later recorded the emissions pledges of many countries.\u000a\u000aFearing deadlock in efforts to reach a binding pact by late next year, governments are pushing in Mexico for broad agreement on less contentious objectives: a fund for climate action, a scheme to protect carbon-absorbing rainforests, and policies to share clean-energy technology with poorer nations.\u000a\u000aMeasuring Success\u000a\u000aRamesh said talks at the Mexican beach resort of Cancun were \u201can historic opportunity\u201d of clinching a pact on saving and expanding forests.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome countries are still opposed to it but my suggestion is we should have a plurilateral agreement on forestry.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Ramesh, the success of Cancun talks depended on:\u000a\u000a* Agreeing a set of operational guidelines for MRV/ICA and technology cooperation.\u000a\u000a* Operational guidelines for the climate Green Fund and guidelines for climate adaptation for developing countries.\u000a\u000a* Clinching a forestry agreement. But the minister said there were hurdles.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are going into Cancun hobbled by the measely US financial commitment,\u201d he said referring to Washington\u2019s less than $2 billion pledge for a global $30 billion fast-start fund for poorer countries most at risk from climate change.\u000a\u000aHe said another problem was Japan\u2019s opposition to extending the Kyoto Protocol into a second commitment period from 2013.\u000a\u000aJapan, among almost 40 industrialized nations with targets under the Protocol until 2012, said it will not extend cuts unless other big emitters like the United States and China also join in.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Ramesh said. \u201cOur (India) mandate is to play the bridge role between developing and developed countries and to ensure that there are some outcomes at Cancun.\u201d

VChief Minister Narendra Modi has penned down his first book in English  on climate change. Previously he has penned short stories,poetry and even essays,but they were written originally in Gujarati.\u000a\u000aTitled Convenient Action: Gujarats Response to Challenges of Climate Change, the book primarily focuses on how Gujarat has responded to the challenges of climate change  the biggest challenge to the world at present.\u000a\u000aThe state government claims to be the only provincial government in the Sub-Continent to have a dedicated climate change department.\u000a\u000aTo be released on December 21 in the presence of Kalam,it will be CMs first book in English\u000a\u000aThe book launch invite calls it a green autobiography by one of the reviewers  Steve Howard. The fact that the Gujarat government has gone ahead and set up its own full-fledged department of climate change is a clear declaration of intent and shows that the actions have been well-planned and thought through, reads Howards comments.\u000a\u000aThe book runs into 250 pages with lots of photos,charts and texts in four colours. It is published by Macmillan Publishers India Limited and is available in both hardback and paperback.\u000a\u000aThe book is yet to be available in the market,but senior executives at Macmillan say the book discusses in great detail the water resources and pollution and how the state government has taken pro-active action to meet the challenges of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe book contains all recent unpublished data on climate change in original form. Modi is the most progressive CM as he chose to write on an issue concerning the society at large rather than his own life,the official said. Modis book release,he added,will be the companys biggest ever launch in India.\u000a\u000aAsked why the chief minister chose Macmillan over any other publishing house,the official said Macmillan is Indias oldest publication house and has operations all over the world,which will give international visibility to the book. That is why Modi probably chose Macmillan, he said.\u000a\u000aIncidentally,Modi is the second politician after former US Vice-President Al Gore to write a book on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe book will be released on December 21 at a function to be presided over by former President APJ Abdul Kalam. Climate change expert R K Pachauri,chairman of the Nobel Laureate committee,Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change,will attend the function as a guest of honour.\u000a\u000aFor all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App

Vmore-in\u000a\u000aCutting carbon emissions: Scores of rich countries made pledges over the last year to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 under the Copenhagen accord but they were not incorporated in the official UN process. Cancun now formally puts those pledges into UN documentation, although they may increase or decrease in future.\u000a\u000aFor the first time, developing countries also agreed to look at how they can cut emissions in the future \u2014 but did not make specific pledges.\u000a\u000aCrucially however, none of the cuts are legally binding. Climate aid: A new climate green fund was agreed at Cancun to transfer money from the developed to developing world to tackle the impacts of climate change. Poorer countries saw this as a success because they will outnumber rich countries on a supervisory panel for the fund, which is due to be set up in 2011. But no figure was put on how much money will go into it.\u000a\u000aSeparately, ministers repeated their political promise made last year at Copenhagen to raise $100bn in climate aid by 2020, starting with $30bn by 2012 for \u201cfast track\u201d financing.\u000a\u000aForests\u000a\u000aFormal backing was given for the UN's deforestation scheme, Redd (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation), under which rich countries pay poorer nations not to chop down forests and so lock away carbon emissions.\u000a\u000aBut details on when and exactly what form the scheme will take \u2014 particularly whether developed countries will be able to use it to \u201coffset\u201d their emissions rather than make cuts at home \u2014 are still vague.\u000a\u000aKyoto protocol: Decisions on the future of the Kyoto protocol, the current international treaty binding rich countries to cut emissions, were effectively deferred until South Africa next year. Whether countries will sign up for a second \u201ccommitment period\u201d to cuts beyond 2012 remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aDecisions on the role that the protocol will play in an ultimate future legal document that binds the world's countries to emissions cuts \u2014 the \u201choly grail\u201d of the UN negotiations \u2014 were delayed.\u000a\u000aTechnology transfer\u000a\u000aThe idea of transferring knowledge of clean technology between countries was backed at Cancun. A technology executive committee and a climate technology centre and network are to be set up, but there are no details on the money, where they will be based, when or by whom.\u000a\u000aCountries agreed to the principle of having their emissions cuts inspected. Such \u201cmonitoring, reporting and verification\u201d will depend on the size of the country's economy, though who will carry out the inspections was not specified. \u2014  Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

VIPCC Chief Dr. R.K. Pachauri has asked the coastal states to fix their infrastructure and programmes to meet the sea level rise, a phenomenon that he says is likely to continue for centuries. File Photo\u000a\u000amore-in\u000a\u000aInter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Chief Dr. R.K. Pachauri has asked the coastal states to fix their infrastructure and programmes to meet the sea level rise, a phenomenon that he says is likely to continue for centuries.\u000a\u000aDr. Pachauri said the sea level rise cannot be controlled now with the measures like reduction in emission of green house because the inertia has set in the climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cInertia in the system will let sea level rise to continue not only for decades but for centuries,\u201d Dr. Pachauri said on Wednesday addressing a lecture in the memory of renowned Goan industrialist Vasudeva V Sinai Dempo.\u000a\u000aIPCC chief, who also is a Director General on The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said the states like Goa should pull up their sleeves to face the after effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aHe said the state needs to work out modalities to protect \u2019low lying and fragile areas\u2019, which are likely to get affected due to sea level rise.\u000a\u000aInsisting that the \u2018zoning laws\u2019 needs to be properly enforced, Dr. Pachauri said this will help to save lives and properties of the people.\u000a\u000aDr. Pachauri said that excessive tourism, mining and shipping industry has left its footprints on state like Goa.\u000a\u000aHe claimed that these kinds of industries have lot of externalities.\u000a\u000a\u201cGoa having a fragile environment is subjected to large amount of tourism. Therefore anything can happen over the years,\u201d he said adding that state government needs to look at impact of this industry in totality.\u000a\u000aIPCC chief said that Goa needs to do detailed assessment of what sea level rise can do for the state, which is geographically small.\u000a\u000aCiting the floods that hit state\u2019s southernmost Canacona taluka in October last year, Pachauri said that climate changes has resulted in the extreme events.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe frequency of floods and droughts is going to be increased in the years to come,\u201d he said adding the states should be ready to face the crucial issue of water management.\u000a\u000aThe internationally famed scientist appealed the governments to have a re-look at their economic growths.\u000a\u000aHe said the model like Bhutan where GDP is replaced with Gross National Happiness (GNH) should be emulated by nations.

VLet\u2019s assess the outcome of Cancun in terms of what the world has achieved to avert climate change . We know the threat of a changing climate is real, we in India are most vulnerable and the world needs drastic emission reduction . Just think: to keep the world below 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, global emissions must drop to 44 billion tonnes of CO2e (all greenhouse gases) by 2020. The world is already emitting 48 billion tonnes of CO2e. This literally means it has run out of time and space to pollute.The first agenda before Cancun was to decide on how much the industrialized countries \u2013 primarily responsible for this global problem \u2013 would cut. The target discussed at the Bali conference in 2007 was a reduction of 40% over 1990 levels by 2020. So, tough decisions were needed at Cancun.The Cancun deal has been struck by letting these countries off the hook. There are no targets. Instead, it has been agreed that now these countries will take action based on what they \u201cpledge\u201d to do. Take the US. If the target was being set (as was decided in Bali) on the basis of its contribution to the stock of gases already in the atmosphere, then it would have to reduce 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. Now, US has \u201cpledged\u201d that it will reduce zero percentage points in the same period. Cancun legitimizes its right to pollute. It is no wonder that it worked hard to stitch the deal. It is no wonder that western media and leaders are ecstatic about the breakthrough. It is their victory.What Cancun has done is to shift the burden of the transition to the developing countries. If the combined pledges of the developed world are compared to those of the developing (including India\u2019s commitment to reduce energy intensity by 20% by 2020) then the sell-out character of the deal becomes clear. The industrialized countries, who till now were being asked to take on the burden, will end up cutting less emissions than the developing world. They cut roughly 0.8-1.8 billion tonnes, against developing country pledges of 2.8 billion tonnes.Even worse, Cancun fails to even address the challenge of climate change. With the deal in force, the world is being put on course for a 3-4 degrees C temperature increase. We know that we are most hit by a changing climate - our monsoon, our lifeline is expected to get more extreme and more variable. With just 0.7 degrees C increase in global temperature, we are seeing signs of present and future danger. So, how can we even begin to celebrate this non-deal?The second agenda was to decide on the mitigation actions of the developing countries and how these would be supported with funds and technology. The deal is worse than nothing on these counts. In the case of money, the old amounts have been repeated \u2013 some $30 billion by 2012 and $100 billion by 2020. But as no new or additional funds have been made available till now and there is open talk about recession in the rich world, this is not even a promise to keep. It is bribe to cajole but not to pay.In technology, where the issue concerned access to clean technology on preferential terms, the deal avoids mention of the contentious word of IPR and pretends all is well because it has small talk about setting up global centres of technology.The Cancun deal is by and for the rich polluters of the world. It does nothing to avert climate change and instead sets up a weak framework for action against pollution. And because it dumps the principle of equity, it negates our right to development.But then we hate being hated in the rich man's world. It is better if we deal for them. This way we can feted as dealmakers. It is another matter that we get nothing for everything we give up.(The author is director of Centre for Science and Environment)

VScientists have found that when dirt breaks apart in the atmosphere, it follows a pattern similar to broken glass and other brittle objects.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJasper Kok at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) said that shattered dirt appears to produce an unexpectedly high number of large dust fragments.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe added that their size determines how they affect climate and weather, influencing the amount of solar energy in the global atmosphere as well as the formation of clouds and precipitation in more dust-prone regions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBecause it plays an important role in controlling the amount of solar energy in the atmosphere, the finding has implications in predicting climate change.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea that all these objects shatter in the same way is a beautiful thing, actually. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of creating order in chaos,\u201d Kok said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cAs small as they are, conglomerates of dust particles in soils behave the same way on impact as a glass dropped on a kitchen floor. Knowing this pattern can help us put together a clearer picture of what our future climate will look like,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNot just that, the study may also improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, especially in dust-prone regions. Results also indicate that marine ecosystems, which draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, may receive substantially more iron from airborne particles than previously estimated.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe study appears this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

VISSUE: The changing taste of Assam tea is something that concerns growers. Women workers in a garden near Guwahati, Assam. Photo: Ritu Raj Konwar | Photo Credit: Ritu Raj Konwar+SEP+Ritu Raj Konwar - Ritu Raj Konwar\u000a\u000aClimate change is affecting the cultivation of Assam tea, with rising temperatures reducing yields and altering the distinctive flavour of India's most popular drink, researchers say.\u000a\u000aHigh hills and abundant rainfall make the north-eastern state of Assam an ideal place to grow tea, with 850 gardens over 3,20,000 hectares (5,93,000 acres) producing the majority of the country's harvest. But in the last 60 years, rainfall has fallen by more than a fifth and minimum temperature has risen by a degree to 19.5C.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is clearly climate change, and it is bound to have major impact on the tea industry,\u201d said Debakanta Handique, a climate scientist in Assam.\u000a\u000aThe Tea Board of India said it had recorded a steady decline in tea production in recent years. In 2007, Assam produced 5,12,000 tonnes of tea. By 2008 this had declined to 4,87,000 tonnes, with estimated production in 2009 down again to 4,45,000 tonnes. A further decrease is expected this year.\u000a\u000a\u2018Serious threat'\u000a\u000aMridul Hazarika, director of Tocklai Tea Research, the oldest tea research station in the world, said rainfall and minimum temperature were two of the most important factors affecting both quality and quantity of harvests.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe decline has been taking place although there has been an increase in the area of tea cultivation as new gardens have come up, and many gardens have added new areas for tea plantation. This is an indication of the seriousness of the threat,\u201d said Hazarika. Efficient rainwater harvesting and new breeds of tea plants were needed to reverse the trend.\u000a\u000a\u201cChanges have already been observed in the flavour, but it is not possible to blame only climate change for this,\u201d he said. \u201cOther factors like the fertilisers used and cultivation methods might also be partly responsible.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe changing taste of Assam tea is a serious concern for growers. Sudipta Nayan Goswami, an Assam-based planter, said subtle changes had already been observed: \u201cThe flavour has changed from what it was before. The creamy and strong flavour is no more. There is a huge demand for Assam tea abroad, and this is due to its strong, bright flavour. The changes will sharply hamper the demand for this variety of tea abroad.\u201d\u2014  Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2010

VThe country leaves the least carbon footprint; however, there is room for improvement, said P. Raghuveer, Additional Principal Conservator of Forests, at a conference on \u2018Environment-friendly technologies' here on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aVedic principle\u000a\u000a\u201cOur per capita carbon footprint is the lowest. But can't we do something to minimise it further?\u201d he asked, referring to a period 7,000 years ago when it was written in the Vedas \u2014 \u201cLet me not take away from mother earth, what I cannot give back\u201d.\u000a\u000aAt the day-long conference, organised by the Andhra Pradesh chapter of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), he said people needed to think out of the box. \u201cWe have laws but enforcement is weak,\u201d said Mr. Raghuveer, who is also the director, AP Forest Academy.\u000a\u000aAnil Kumar Chalamalasetti, convener, CII-AP Energy & Environment Panel and CEO, Greenko Energies, said growing global awareness and campaigns by the stakeholders had some effect in saving the eco-system. But there was still little debate that the impact of environmental degradation was real and quantifiable. M.C. Pargaien, Special Secretary, AP Pollution Control Board, explained the strides the board had made for other similar bodies across the country to follow. The board was monitoring air pollution levels across 12 parameters, not done elsewhere in the country.\u000a\u000aShakti Sagar, Chairman, CII-AP, welcomed.
